However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.  I have zero productivity apps on it (which i like) I have zero communication apps on it (which I like), This tablet for me is a way to get away from life.  I have a phone for talking, and work, and teams, and slack.Dont kid yourself, this is not a high end tablet.  These one star reviews needs to take a better look at themselves and understand  you get what you pay for.  And for me, this absoutley works for what i need it to do.  And i dont feel like crap if i drop it and break it.why not five star.  Speakers are not great, again get what you pay for... which to me is not a big deal... i would of only taken a half a star off for them if I could.

",0.0578223471,pc,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.151,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.9716997151,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.

The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.152,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.9716997152,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.153,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.9716997153,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.

This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"".

I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.154,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.9716997154,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.

",0.8478666545,pc," Coming from a Fire HD 7, then a ""Kids"" Kindle 8, this is really an impressive and welcome upgrade.So I really want, and need, to explain that the only difference between the ""kids edition"" and the regular one, other than price, is that the ""kids edition"" comes with--A kidproof case (and this one even has a kickstand!!) Which yes, the kindle kid cases are amazing with protection.-The year of Free Time, which is the kids gaming platform.-The 2 year replacement guarantee (that I have used in the past for a broken screen. SUPER easy process. You have to CALL Amazon to do this, it cannot be done via your order page; Return the kindle without case to Amazon, they ship you a replacement kindle without the case.)O N L Y differences. So when I see all of these negative reviews about the kids kindle, then I jump over to the positive reviews on the normal kindle, it's baffling. And I did compare the two because it's a $50 price difference, and what really sold this version for me, rather than buying everything separately, was the 2 year replacement guarantee.My child started out with my Fire HD 7, which you can switch between adult and kid profiles on as well. Any kindle can be a kids kindle as long as you've got a childs profile set up. Once she got bigger/older, we bought her the kids edition 8. So the kids edition 10 is her Christmas gift this year. It's so much faster than the 8, obviously bigger. And I loved that with having it connected to my account before shipment, setup was fast-All the hard work was done and I just had to select a pin for this device, it was set up and ready to go within 10 minutes. Memory card slot on the side, removal and replacement of the case is MUCH easier than on the 8. The volume on this thing is loud, crisp, and clear.With the 10, the only differences I've noticed that would be worth mentioning is that usually on the other kindles, you would pull down the settings bar to click on the icon and switch profiles. With this one it seems you've got to lock, click the icon, then switch profiles. Not a big deal to me and I'm sure it wont be to her. She uses my profile for regular youtube and roblox, just normal things that aren't accessible on the kids/free time dashboard. Other difference here is that it now uses a USBC charger, which is another positive since every phone in my house uses USBC so it's easier to replace and keep up with.The free time dashboard. Lots of negative feedback on that one; So sometime ago, maybe in the last year or 2 I think, free time had an update. I HATED the update. It jumbled literally everything together and she had to look for all of her downloaded games, just randomly clicking on everything. But this was a year or 2 ago and the dashboard on the 10 is no different than the dash on the 7 and 8. It's just the same free time update that's been there for a year or 2 now.She has an ipad air that we have her school apps on. They weren't available on kindle so we keep the ipad around for homework. She absolutely hates the ipad. So if your kid is an apple fan, they may not like this one. My daughter had 2 kindles before she got an ipad from a relative so she was already used to the interface. iPad is easy for her too but she would rather not use anything, than reach for the ipad when the kindle is dead/charging.For anyone wanting more in depth reviews on this Kindle, jump on over to the Kindle 10 listing and read them there because there is virtually no difference between the ""Kids Edition"" and the regular 10.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.156,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.9716997156,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

USB type C port, SD card slot, and USB 3.03. 4 gigs of RAM is good though the 16gb memory is not enough, just insert $3 32gb micros sd card, it is much better than spend $100 more for a 64gb disk.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.159,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.9716997159,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.

This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like.

If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface.

But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1510,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971510,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

It's so much faster than the 8, obviously bigger.

She uses my profile for regular youtube and roblox, just normal things that aren't accessible on the kids/free time dashboard.

Also any SD card from an older device will not copy over, the SD card must be formatted on this device.I highly recommend getting a large SD card to go with this. We bought a 128GB card so I shouldn't need to ever worry about space.This is a great kids tablet with great screen. It is much faster than older models with increased storage.

The USB-C charges faster and in either direction, so I don't have to fumble around flipping the micro USB if it's dark.  However the included charger here is only 9W.  My chargers at home are 15 or 18W so I don't use the 9W one at all.I am docking 1 star on this because I can no longer install apps onto the microSD card.  That was possible on old Kids Fire tablets.I bought 2 of these at a 2 for 1 discount.  I also sent in my old Kids Fire 10 for a $30 gift card.  These are for my little toddler boys, who love them.

",0.05782234713,pc,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1513,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971513,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad.

But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1514,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.

I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1515,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971515,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon).

The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model).

They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1516,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971516,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.

",0.84786665417,pc," Coming from a Fire HD 7, then a ""Kids"" Kindle 8, this is really an impressive and welcome upgrade.So I really want, and need, to explain that the only difference between the ""kids edition"" and the regular one, other than price, is that the ""kids edition"" comes with--A kidproof case (and this one even has a kickstand!!) Which yes, the kindle kid cases are amazing with protection.-The year of Free Time, which is the kids gaming platform.-The 2 year replacement guarantee (that I have used in the past for a broken screen. SUPER easy process. You have to CALL Amazon to do this, it cannot be done via your order page; Return the kindle without case to Amazon, they ship you a replacement kindle without the case.)O N L Y differences. So when I see all of these negative reviews about the kids kindle, then I jump over to the positive reviews on the normal kindle, it's baffling. And I did compare the two because it's a $50 price difference, and what really sold this version for me, rather than buying everything separately, was the 2 year replacement guarantee.My child started out with my Fire HD 7, which you can switch between adult and kid profiles on as well. Any kindle can be a kids kindle as long as you've got a childs profile set up. Once she got bigger/older, we bought her the kids edition 8. So the kids edition 10 is her Christmas gift this year. It's so much faster than the 8, obviously bigger. And I loved that with having it connected to my account before shipment, setup was fast-All the hard work was done and I just had to select a pin for this device, it was set up and ready to go within 10 minutes. Memory card slot on the side, removal and replacement of the case is MUCH easier than on the 8. The volume on this thing is loud, crisp, and clear.With the 10, the only differences I've noticed that would be worth mentioning is that usually on the other kindles, you would pull down the settings bar to click on the icon and switch profiles. With this one it seems you've got to lock, click the icon, then switch profiles. Not a big deal to me and I'm sure it wont be to her. She uses my profile for regular youtube and roblox, just normal things that aren't accessible on the kids/free time dashboard. Other difference here is that it now uses a USBC charger, which is another positive since every phone in my house uses USBC so it's easier to replace and keep up with.The free time dashboard. Lots of negative feedback on that one; So sometime ago, maybe in the last year or 2 I think, free time had an update. I HATED the update. It jumbled literally everything together and she had to look for all of her downloaded games, just randomly clicking on everything. But this was a year or 2 ago and the dashboard on the 10 is no different than the dash on the 7 and 8. It's just the same free time update that's been there for a year or 2 now.She has an ipad air that we have her school apps on. They weren't available on kindle so we keep the ipad around for homework. She absolutely hates the ipad. So if your kid is an apple fan, they may not like this one. My daughter had 2 kindles before she got an ipad from a relative so she was already used to the interface. iPad is easy for her too but she would rather not use anything, than reach for the ipad when the kindle is dead/charging.For anyone wanting more in depth reviews on this Kindle, jump on over to the Kindle 10 listing and read them there because there is virtually no difference between the ""Kids Edition"" and the regular 10.
",0.82590067417,pc," Amazon rushed this product. The tablet itself is so flimsy the screen is discolored and you barely push on it and it looks like the screen is going to break.

The battery life is better, processor I believe is snappier and most importantly it uses USB-C now so I can ditch the micro USB cables lying around my home and car.  The USB-C charges faster and in either direction, so I don't have to fumble around flipping the micro USB if it's dark.  However the included charger here is only 9W.  My chargers at home are 15 or 18W so I don't use the 9W one at all.I am docking 1 star on this because I can no longer install apps onto the microSD card.  That was possible on old Kids Fire tablets.I bought 2 of these at a 2 for 1 discount.  I also sent in my old Kids Fire 10 for a $30 gift card.  These are for my little toddler boys, who love them.

",0.8195586218,pc,"I write this review as the former owner of 3 Asus PG279Qs and one PG279QZ.  I was drawn to this realm of the monitor market because I do not believe that 4K displays are worth it at this particular point in time.  As far as I see it, the majority are a compromise as the bandwidth requirements for running 4:4:4 chroma subsampling, an extended color gamut, a refresh rate of 144 Hz and beyond, and a resolution of 3840x2160 all at the same time will be much better served by DP 1.5 or HDMI 2.1 (proper HDR wouldn't hurt either).  Although it could be argued that achieving 144 frames at 1440p is more resource intensive than 60 frames at 2160p, I believe the experience to be the most immersive, at least until 144+ frames becomes viable at 4K.  Unfortunately, based on the price to performance ratio trend of the current generation of graphics cards (Nvidia’s in specific), it is going to be a long, long time until that is achievable at a reasonable price.  All things aside, I can state with confidence that I’ve found my sweet spot for monitors in the form of LG’s 27GL850.  It has addressed all of the quality control concerns that I’ve experienced throughout my quest of trying to obtain a high refresh rate, 1440p IPS-type display.  Seeing as this is an LG product, the monitor can rightfully be referred to as having an IPS (In-Plane Switching) panel as this is their proprietary term for the technology that produces the wider color gamut and viewing angles.I did not buy this display because I am a hardcore gamer; I bought it because I wanted a quality monitor with good color reproduction, a uniform panel, and good response time.  My purchase was based solely on the off chance of LG producing a monitor where quality control wasn’t an after-thought.  Now that it has finally arrived, I am proud to report that this monitor delivers.  The display has zero backlight bleed and excellent uniformity, contrast, and response time.  White uniformity is even across the entirety of the screen while the factory calibrated colors appear accurate even next to my calibrated Dell.  Outside of sRGB mode, the colors do come off as over-saturated, although some may prefer the added vibrancy of the Nano IPS technology (I did not).  Black levels are on par with most other IPS-type displays that I’ve used despite the specified measurement coming in at a somewhat lower figure than similar displays.  As for response time, it seems universally accepted by the monitor community that the fast setting is adequate in preventing overshoot.  The faster and fastest settings produce undesirable artifacts known as coronas.  Despite this monitor not having variable overdrive, I have had no perceivable issues when it comes to gaming as I do tend to binge on CS:GO from time to time.If I had to nit-pick, and I do because this is a review where transparency informs prospective buyers, I will say that the strength of the presence of IPS glow on my display falls on the moderate end of the spectrum.  This could be due to the fact the panel is 27 inches, which is a decent amount of real estate for this phenomenon to occur.  It is also important to keep in mind that this is something that varies on a per panel basis.  Without a doubt, it is a consequence of choosing to utilize an IPS panel for one’s computing purposes.  Regardless, it is nothing unexpected or anything that cannot be addressed by adjusting the brightness level as well as the viewing distance, height, and angle.  Besides simply turning down the brightness, placing the monitor further away is one way to remedy the matter.  Another way to minimize the glow is to position the screen in such a way that one’s gaze meets the center of the screen as IPS-type displays fare better when the height of the top bezel is of equal height or greater in relation to one’s eyes.  A final tip is to manipulate the screen’s tilt angle as oftentimes angling it upwards reduces glow.By applying these adjustments, I can easily say that this is overall the best monitor that I’ve used to date.  I will not sit here and bash Asus’ most recent iteration of their high refresh rate, 1440p IPS-type display, the PG279QZ, as one can refer to the top review of the PG279QZ to see what types of problems plague those monitors.  What I will say is that it’s a breath of fresh air to see that quality control still exists in consumer-grade monitors.  Realistically, no manufacturing process is going to produce near perfect monitors all of the time; however, this purchase has instilled confidence in me when it comes to the LG brand.  I imagine that this model will provide all disillusioned monitor buyers a glimmer of hope when it comes to having a fighting chance at obtaining a quality monitor in this realm of the market.***As per a request in the comments, I've attached pictures of the monitor at brightness of zero, 50%, and 100%.***
",0.518,pc,"LG set my expectations high for this monitor from when they first debuted it at CES 2019, but they have only let me down after release.  Even a couple months before release they were advertising this monitor as g-sync monitor, overclocking capabilities, and with sphere lighting.  Then about the week of pre-order time they took down the LG info page on this monitor and released this with only g-sync compatible, no overclocking, and no sphere-lighting.  They will deny all the things they promised, but you can find youtube videos on it.The monitor I received had 1 dead pixel on the bottom left, everything else was fine.  Brightness is enough for me, but like in Linus's review it's technically not bright enough to meet HDR certification.  I'm upgrading from a 24in 144hz 1ms TN monitor, so my gaming experience has definitely been better with this one, but I'm not impressed.  I'm subtracting one star for the dead pixel and two for not delivering on what they initially promised.  I don't care if it would have cost more for all the features I mentioned, LG advertised set the bar high on themselves.  I know what I want and I'm willing to pay for it, so don't use any cost cutting excuses.Thanks for reading.
",0.14881175818,pc,"Let me start off my saying I currently own a 240Hz BenQ XL2546 monitor, but I've also owned the comparable Asus  1440P IPS PG279Q (formerly the best 1440p IPS panel), 240Hz Alienware AW2518H (one of the fastest panels in the world), Viewsonic XG2402 (highest rated 144hz 1080p TN panel), Samsung 144Hz VGA (nice colors and blacks, but blurring slow response times), and a 55"" LG OLED 4K TV @ 120Hz I occasionally use for the ultimate viewing experience.IN SHORT: It's hands down one my favorite gaming monitors for 2019. BUT, if you're a competitive gamer stick with a TN 240Hz panel.After spending years reading critical reviews, comparing performance measurements, and outright buying various panels trying to find the perfect balance of performance and picture quality, I wasn't impressed. But right now I can finally say this monitor checks enough boxes to be considered the best all around gaming panel I've ever owned.These are the metrics I used to calculate my review:Contrast: Below Average (At 770, it sits below average for most IPS panels between 1000-1200)Colors: Excellent (98% DCI-P3, average is about 90%, a bigger difference in reality than on paper)Resolution: Excellent (no screen door effect, can't see pixels even with larger 27"" screen)Response Time: Great (compared to a TN its average-fast, for an IPS its blazing)Input Lag: Excellent (4.3 ms, one of the fastest 144Hz panels on the market)Refresh Rate: Good (144Hz, wish it were at least 165 Hz)Though 4k 120Hz panels have better picture quality, all have terribly slow response times and some with unacceptable input lag (looking at you Predator X27). Then there's the ultrafast 240Hz panels which don't have the resolution or the colors to truly make content on your screen exciting.The fact is most panels come with significant sacrifices in performance or overall picture. But, I can say the LG gives you near top tier grades in all of metrics and will leave but the most competitive buyers satisfied with their multimedia and gaming experience. That's why  it's currently the best 144 Hz overall gaming panel on the market, especially at $500.Overall 4.5/5 Stars. 1/2 star off for the mediocre contrast levels and lack of features at this price range.Pros:Incredibly Low Input Lag (feels as fast as my 240Hz BenQ monitor)Crispy 1440P Resolution (easier to read text, see details in games and movies, and add a professional look to everything)Fastest 144Hz IPS Panel in the world (faster than many gaming TV panels, much smoother than the Asus PG279Q)Incredibly  Vivid & Wide Color Gamut (best I've seen on any gaming panel under $1000)Low Back light Bleed (Only very small bleed on the bottom corners. Great for an IPS but will vary from panel to panel)Minimalist Height Adjustable Stand (Doesn't swivel but that's not an issue for me, love the design and slim profile)Modern OSD + Nipple Joystick (Makes navigating the menu easy and intuitive with plenty of options)Solid Connectivity Options (Dual HDMI, Display Port, Headphone Out, and dual USB 3.0 Ports)Cons:Adaptive-Sync Adds Noticeable Stutter using nvidia GPU (never had this issue with any G-sync compatible panel in the past)Only 1 out of the 8 picture modes has full picture controlsMediocre Contrast Levels (typical of LG IPS Panels, not horrendous, but blacks can appear a bit washed in dark scenes)Average Input Lag for Console Gaming (Disappointing if you plan to use this monitor for console gaming)Stand Doesn't Swivel and May Not Adjust Low Enough for Some UsersWishes (not cons):BLUE LIGHT Filter (important eye health feature for extended viewing sessions)165Hz Overclock (like Asus PG279Q)RGB Sphere LightingHeadphone Stand (BenQ has one, its a clean way to hold the headphones when not in use)Built-In Speakers (Nice to have built-in speakers when needed as desk space is valuable)Bottom line: If you want the best gaming performance, stick with a 240Hz panel. But if you're willing to make a small sacrifice in performance for a large jump in picture quality, there's nothing on the market this good.Calibration Settings (help from Rtings.com):Game Mode: Gamer 1 (Desktop and Movie Use)Adaptive Sync: OffBlack Stabilizer: 50Response Time: FastBrightness: 15- 23 in the Day / 3-10 at Night (depends on your preference)Contrast: 68Sharpness: 50Gamma: Mode 2Color Temp: CustomR/G/B: 50-50-50DFC: OffSmart Energy Saving: OffPower LED: Off (your preference)Automatic Standby: 4HDisplay Port 1.4: Enable (make sure to use a display port cable to reach 144Hz 1440p)OSD Lock: OffGame Mode: Gamer 2 (Gaming Use) (slightly brighter blacks and brightness help me spot and track enemies)Adaptive Sync: OffBlack Stabilizer: 55Response Time: FastBrightness: 23-33 in the Day / 10-20 at NightContrast: 68PC build ( I appreciate my PC  much more after using it with this monitor, I see why Apple is so big on having the best displays for their devices):i7-9700KHYPERX 32GB 3600MHz RAMZ390 Maximus Hero XISTRIX GTX 1080Ti970 EVO 500GB SSD

IPS glow exists but BLB is minimal compared to the last one. Will update the picture later on. Colors are beautiful, response time is great, g-sync works out of the box flawlessly, gaming experience got much better with this monitor! Highly recommended (assuming you get a good model!)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons: Seems I lost the ""panel lottery"" as I noticed the BLB when playing dark themed games or watching movies. Build quality is OK.Pros: Pretty much everything else, it is a great monitor.BLB was so bad I had to return it. Doesn't feel good as I waited more than a month for this monitor to arrive. I'll be waiting for amazon to restock and order again, will give better ratings then.
",0.93313980118,pc,"For under $380 I think it's going to be hard to beat this monitor. Especially since the 27GL850 is consistently out of stock. For the price you are getting:- Essentially the same panel as the 27GL850- Excellent response time + motion handling- Officially certified by Nvidia G-Sync support- FreeSync- sRGB color space- More money in your pocket- You can actually find this monitor in stockWhat's missing from it's bigger brother:- No USB ports- No wide gamut color support- No HDR (there isn't really any true HDR on the 850 either so you're not technically missing out)I didn't notice any back light bleed, stuck pixels, or excessive IPS glow on my unit. I almost hesitate to include pictures of the monitor when it's on because the pictures do not accurately show what I'm seeing in person. In the pictures it looks as if there may be some excessive glow in the top right and bottom left of the screen but I assure you that I absolutely do not see that in person and only via my camera.The contrast is ok. You're not going to get the deepest blacks but it still looks great and if you're not nitpicking, I don't think you're really going to notice it either. The color pops nicely though I recommend setting the brightness to at least 75-80 to get the most out of the picture. Tested out G-Sync with my GTX 1070 and have had no problems. G-Sync is on by default so you won't even have to go into your settings and mess with it. G-Sync only works via Display Port FYI.Knocking off a star because my stand wobbles a little bit where the foot meets the pole. It also comes with the shortest power cable I have ever seen. It's maybe 3 feet long. There is no swivel and It's entirely made of plastic so don't get your hopes up for metal anything.If you're looking for a monitor in this price range, I don't really see any need to look any further.
",0.04480418618,pc,"What I liked:+ Great response times: I don't think anyone is going to miss their 144hz TN panel after using this.+ Near perfect gamma 2.2 tracking on default gamma 2 mode+ Average Delta-E around 1.5: not bad+ Amazing color gradient handling when set to 10bit mode+ No BLB or dead pixelsWhat I disliked:- Default whitepoint is too cool (measured 7200K) and none of the provided modes gave an actual 6500K. Luckily, with a colorimeter in-hand (Colormunki Display) I was able to calibrate to 6500K with minimal loss of contrast by adjusting the RGB gains.- IPS glow isn't any better than my old IPS monitors. You'd think now that tablet and laptop IPS panels have mostly resolved this issue that monitor panels would do that too.Other notes- Contrast measured at 870:1, a bit low for an IPS panel although I cannot subjectively notice a difference in black levels compared to my other IPS monitor that measured 1150:1. If you're looking for deeper blacks you're better off with a 3000:1 VA.- Gamma mode 2 is the only gamma mode that was calibrated at the factory. Changing the gamma mode to modes 1,3, or 4 resulted in a white point of 6300K, contrast ratio increased to 1060:1, however the gamma tracking is really bad on these modes.- Gamma mode 1 results in an approx gamma of 2.0, mode 3 is approx gamma 2.5, mode 4 is approx gamma 2.3, but again the gamma curves on these modes are messed up and do not conform closely to these numbers so I ended up using gamma mode 2 and just correcting the white point.
",0.24845418318,pc,"Update: After hearing back from LG today it appears to be a firmware issue so I've decided that I'm just going to return the monitor as defective (their other option is to ship it to them to have repaired which could take weeks).  I'm extremely bummed as the monitor is really nice, but I just don't have much faith in the monitor at this point and I'm not paying even more money for their service plan so it seems as if i'm better off getting something else.  Hopefully if you do end up buying this monitor you have better luck than I did. I did include one picture that shows how the monitor's input section screen was clearly glitched for reference.I've had this monitor about 2 weeks and I can say that it is beautiful - when it is working.  After about 2 weeks the monitor started not recognizing that my computer was connected to it and I have not been able to fix it.  I tried both HDMI and DP, in all ports, and with 2 different computers and I cannot get it to work.  The cords do work to our TV though.  This is leading me to think there is some issue with the monitors internal software, but even a factory reset didn't fix the problem.  I'm going to continue messing with this and I'm reaching out to LG but until I hear back or can get this fixed i'm rating this 1 star.

",0.94492232818,pc,"I've been using an Asus VG278Q 27 inch monitor for a few years now which is 1080p, 144hz, and has a TN panel.The LG monitor has been a solid upgrade in the areas that count:- Resolution upgrade from 1080p to 1440p- Panel upgrade from TN to IPS- Retained 144hz refresh rate- Retained low input lagBy replacing the old Asus monitor with this LG, I've been able to keep the great gaming capability of a high refresh rate + low input lag TN panel monitor and receive an upgrade to a higher resolution and an IPS panel.I have a feeling a big target audience for this monitor will be folks with the same monitor I had or very similar...a 1080p 144hz TN panel monitor. If you have a similar monitor and are considering upgrading I don't think you will regret it, however the only downside so far is the monitor brightness is not its strong point. I turned mine up to about 90% and have been happy with that so far.
",0.30575120418,pc,"I was waiting for this monitor for some time for one reason: it (seemed to) promise the motion handling of a TN in an IPS. Indeed, Linus's video along with the test results at rtings.com made it seem like a sure thing that it would AT LEAST be a significant improvement over previous gaming IPS displays. I still can't believe it, but upon inspection I saw no difference between this and my Acer XB271HU (and also my Acer just had a better picture overall).The only improvement over my Acer was comparing the LG's ""faster"" pixel setting to my Acer's max setting, but that was with significantly more artifacts and it still didn't touch the clarity of my previous gaming TN display. Now the issues of the ""1ms GTG"" claim with the faster setting was already known, but the test results and exact response times I read were NOT on this setting. This LG should still be much better when on ""fast"", but this was not the case for me.The salt in the wound is in the photo I posted: there was some kind of permanent black mark that was inside the screen (maybe dead pixels, but it looked odd), so this was a return item immediately anyway. I simply can't reconcile the pixel performance I observed with what everyone is saying, it's almost like mine is defective in some way other than the thing I just stated. Regardless, I'm disappointed in LG whose products I normally love (current and previous phone are LG).Assuming no defects, if this is your first gaming IPS display then it's probably DECENT. But given how its new ""nano IPS"" tech did no better than my 3-year-old Acer (which is still a bit pricier, actually, but also has native G-sync hardware, although I'm glad that's on its way out), and the defect which I know happens but is annoying nonetheless, I have to give a low mark.

Has a RGB light switch which is a great new feature. Unlike the K1, you can easily turn the lights off at night without having to unplug the USB connector. It also has a microphone on/off switch, similar to the K1.2. Sound quality is good, similar to K1. Not like the $200-$300 headsets you can buy, but surprisingly good for the price. Surround sound also works great when playing games.3. Looks great, build quality is solid, and the cushions are very soft.Cons:1. Tight for my large head, works well for my 10 year old son. The K1 is a little wider and doesn't put as much pressure on the head, especially when using it for a longer periods of time.Overall, a very good gaming headset and for the price, it's a steal.

The comfort and fit of this headset is improved in the sense that it is more adjustable for people who have smaller heads so that it is a tighter fit. This headset also appears to be noise cancelling and maintains a solid seal over the ears while in use. The sound quality is also pretty fantastic, especially with movies where you really get the 7.1 surround sound kicking. Also when you’re using the headset, the chat clarity is spot on...and the microphone quality is certainly a step up from the previous model.

There is also a control to mute your microphone if you choose to and they include an adapter that splits into two different cords for PC. One for a separate mic function and the other for audio. The microphone is great. I own the K8headphones by them as well and the mic on these sound better after comparing them on a pc recording software. The earcups on these headphones are not earshaped. They are circular and not in an oval shape so if you have big ears, they may hurt. Other than that, it is a good buy. I took a few pictures and some in the dark to showcase the lighting they have.

You can choose to have the USB plugged in for this or keep it unplugged and the light doesn't come on.  I usually have mine off.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1520,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971520,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history).

In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1521,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971521,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

Unfortunately, this has made updating the MB/BIOS driver(s) a pain because the ""B360M Xtreme"" by Asrock does not exist on Asrock's website. I am banking on downloading Asrock's update tool to fix this issue. However, Speccy says that the MB is MSI, so I'm at a loss.You are provided a CD with drivers on it, but since this PC has no optical drive its pointless. Yes you could buy an external one, but Cyberpower could also provide this software via a USB or simply provide you a parts list with your particular build so you aren't left trying to haphazardly sift through their drivers update page.All things considered, this is not a debilitating issue but it is an oversight on their part. That said, this MB is sketchy.Edit: UpdateThe disc it comes with contains a virus/adware named ""prsetup.exe."" I informed their customer support of this issue. Secondly, I checked the manufacturer of the MB via command prompt, and got MSI instead of Asrock again. Customer support also linked me to the B360M Pro 4 on Asrock's website for driver downloads.

Being somewhat new to buying a tower as my last computer was a gaming laptop, I can into this experience blind and was only met with exceeded expectations and nice surprises. The box was immaculate and the pc was in excellent condition upon arrival. Coming from a loud laptop the fans on this pc are exceptionally quiet even under load!I tested a few games being Overwatch, Monster Hunter World and Hearthstone with all running exceptionally well.I expected long updates and initial boot but within 10 minutes from the easy set up I was up and gaming. This PC is fantastic and did not disappoint.Coming from someone who typically won’t spend much money towards things I don’t regret this purchase at all.

It even plays better than my gf’s Mac.I also like that you have the option of changing the computer color or turning it off altogether.

The case does allow for easy upgrades as well!My only Con with this PC is that it does tend to get hot inside because the front plate does not allow for that much air to move out. Watch out for that and be mindful of how long you play and just manage it the best you can. Don’t overstress about heating and pay constant attention to it just let it be an afterthought going through your head!Besides that this PC is great!

",0.97130876822,pc,"I was a little skeptical about buying pre-built but I did months of research and I can safely say this computer is incredible for the price.The GTX 1660ti alone brings this computer up a huge notch seeing as it is the latest in Nvidia's quiet and powerful mid-high end Gpu's. Then if you take into account the intel i5 9400f being the newest in top performing CPU's and for gaming at ultra settings and getting at least 60fps for even games like Overwatch and Sekiro it is an incredible deal. Both of these components would be a great deal but to also get the RGB fans with a color change remote (very cool),a 120g SSD as well as a 1TB hard drive, a 500 watt PSU inside of a beautiful case,and the cable management is some of the best I have ever seen. I can't find anything pre-built for this price that offers more.The only downsides are that the PSU is locked into a cage at the bottom which if you wish to replace it takes a few extra steps to get into. Also having 8g of RAM is ok, but if you plan on recording games which this PC does an incredible job at you will need to get that extra 8g RAM stick just to help with extra processes and video editing. The only other downside is the wifi adapters are a little loose and could have been installed better but they still work perfectly just a little annoying.That's about it for 850$ I honestly couldn't find a better deal if you just want to have a great gaming PC you can open up, download some drivers, and start playing the latest games within minutes. The SSD drive is super fast and as long as you don't fill it up with nonsense (use the TB hard drive for that) you will have a very fast PC for the next 5 years minimum.Highly recommend to anyone who just wants to game now and now get into the nitty-gritty of computer building. I would recommend you take this as a chance to learn as much about hardware and software with your new PC as it's a great hobby and potential career choice. Not to mention it's fun and you'll feel like a car man with a standard that you know how to use and manipualter to your will. Have Fun!

",0.20665103222,pc,"This review is for the (now) $750 i5, GTX 1060, 8GB DDR4, 240 GB SSD, 1TB HDD model.First I would like to say that this is a great deal for a basic/starter gaming PC. If you want to get into PC gaming but don't know how to build one, or are just too busy to take on the task yourself, then this is the machine for you. Sure, it's not the absolute best of the best, but for $750 it is definitely a worthwhile starter build. The RAM is good, the motherboard, though it is Cyberpower's own brand, is respectable. The SSD and HDD are both nice quality WD drives. The graphics card in mine is an MSI GTX 1060, not some no-name brand so that was a nice surprise. The fans work great and the system stays cool even after a good long gaming session. I play mainly DBD, so I didn't need a beast of a machine, but it runs smooth as silk on ultra settings, giving me a constant 80+ FPS.Really, the only complaint I have about the system components is it only having 8GB or RAM. With the mid-range Ballistix RAM they used, they could have thrown in a full 16GB at minimal extra cost to them. The other nit-picky issues I have are purely cosmetic. First, I wish the keyboard was backlit. I mean, the logo lights up on it, why can't we have nicely lit keys too? Second, the side panel is acrylic. I realize the product description doesn't specify tempered glass or acrylic, but the box is covered with warning labels that say ""Fragile Tempered Glass"" so I was disappointed when I popped them off to find them to be plastic. They look nice though.Al in all, this is a great build for someone jst starting out. Though it runs smooth as silk as is, it is certainly future-ready as well. It has plenty of space and compatible components that will make it easy to upgrade for years to come. If you're on the fence about this PC, don't be. It is a great way to open the door to PC gaming.
",0.89568769922,pc,"While shopping for a new gaming PC I considered buying all the parts and doing a self build.  I decided I didn't want to hassle with it.  So I found this PC and felt the price was decent for what you get.  It arrived well safely packaged and I had it set up in minutes.I mostly play Guild Wars 2 which is said to be poorly optimized because I think it uses an old engine.  I get frame rates mostly in 90s and low 100's in open world with graphics set to max.  Of course they drop during large group events with tons of flashing effects but are good enough to still enjoy the game. I really don't monitor frame rates constantly because if I don't notice an issue I figure there is no reason to obsess over it.  If I turned some settings a bit down I'm sure they would improve more but I don't mind the way it is.The PC is fairly quiet as far as fan noise and my GPU temps seem to never go above 75 C when it is really working hard.  It didn't come loaded with bloatware that had to be removed which was a bonus.  I don't think the CPU for the model I bought can be overclocked though.  I have not looked into that much. The LED lights were an interesting little feature.  Not something that was a part of my buying decision, but a nice touch I suppose.I have two minor complaints.  One, the SSD drive is only 120GB which seems kind of small for the upgraded version of this PC.  Of course I knew this before I purchased and it was kind of a turn off as I was shopping.  Sure I could put games on the 1TB HDD but games load faster and loading screens are much faster on an SSD.  At least the game I play.  So it seems they could of tossed in a 250GB SSD for the upgraded version.  I'll end up upgrading that myself at some point.The second is that the USB ports on the front seem like they might be seated a bit off on mine.  They are very tight making it difficult to insert and remove USB devices.  The ones on the back are fine and don't have this issue.Overall I'm very happy with this PC for the price.  Yes there are a few small things I didn't care for but it does what I need and does it well.

Right now, Vector can fist bump, play with his cube, look around, give me the weather...all the things mentioned above. I knew that Vector connected to 2.4hz Wifi. That was no problem at my house, or at my best friend's house. But Vector doesn't want to connect to WiFi at work, but neither will my phone. Vector is connected via Bluetooth. I suspect it is a Wifi problem and not a Vector problem.What really sold me was Vector connecting with Alexa in the near future.When I was a kid, right after WWII, I played with little robots made in Japan.

When I picture an unfinished product I think of google home. It can still have utility and perform commands well but it's not done as google assistant at it is still improving and future features such as ""AI calling"" are coming. With Vector, I knew I wasn't getting utility but a cute robot. That's fine but he's not that cute or lifelike to be honest. When his ""personality"" was his eyes thinking 90% of the time. 5% a squint of happiness when he looks at me and 5% of anger when I wake him up or pick him up.... That's not worth the 250 dollar price tag. I'm sorry.My google home was 70 and it frankly has 10x the personality this robot has. Google home doesn't have faces but it tells me jokes, tells me stories, tells me the news, has quirky responses to stupid questions I have, and much more. The issue with a personality is that it needs to be a lot more than 2 eyes moving in a lot of different directions. We need to talk to Vector. That needs to be Vector's X-factor over a real pet. You see with a real pet. You can't talk to it and it just has it's behaviors to communicate with you. However, you're looking at a live being. You see it's eyes. It's love. Vector will frankly never beat that because you're just looking at pixels. But if it was able to talk? Really be an assistant. That could change the game for it.It's too loud and distractingEven at its lowest volume, the tracks are so loud. It's too distracting. As a college student who studies 10 hours a day, I can tolerate some distractions but this was ridiculous. At a point, I just wanted it to sleep all the time and just realized I didn't want it at all to be honest. Sigh.It doesn't follow commands like 80% of the timeThis is a big issue. I was using the app while giving commands to see Vector's thoughts. I told it to go back to its charging pad. It does start doing that. Then sees a water bottle. Gets distracted. Then wanders off again. The same thing when I ask it to come here. It was just so unreliable as a robot. Robots follow commands. This is what I expected and I don't think that's too much to ask to be honest. If I type ""B"" on a laptop, I expect B to appear on the screen. If I ask google to play music, I expect ""music"" to be played. If I ask vector to go to its charging pad because its being disruptive to my work, I expect it to got to its charging pad.Was it all bad?I won't lie. It made me feel. I felt genuinely sad writing this review and putting him back in the box to be returned. The last time he closed his eyes as I turned him off made me feel bad. But that's it to be honest. He wasn't even that fun the first 5 minutes. He couldn't even say my name. Also, I had this thought that the people with issues with his voice recognition were just bad at english. No. I use Google home and siri all the time. Mostly google but they understand my commands like 95% of the time. Vector? Maybe 20-30% of the time. I was born and raised in the US and am a native English speakers.Overall?This product needs a LOT of improvement. This is not a finished product. Not even close. When I expect an unfinished product, I expect it to have at least one thing it is good at so I can keep myself interested in it until improvement come. However, this wasn't the case. Voice Recognition? 20-30% recognition. Follow through on commands? No. It gets too distracted. Personality? Two pixelated eyes isn't enough. At least talk to me.I'm frankly very disappointed in this product because I was so excited for it. I was even distracted while doing work and studying in wait for it and it just wasn't good. RIP the exam I studied for on Friday...As a college student, money is tight. I am willing to spend money on things that make me happy and destress like google home. However, 200 dollars for a robot that is distracting, doesn't listen, gets distracted easily, and doesn't even have much personality to be honest. I felt conned. Honestly.

Scratch proofIt's made of really hard material and not a single scratch after several days use. Still looks like a brand new one.3. Hidden ethernet portUnlike other hubs with an open ethernet port, this one hides the port perfectly. You can hardly see it's plugged in.4.

It has PD USB-C port which can provide power, 3 USB, SD, TF and Ethernet and HDMI port. It’s inconvenient traveling abroad or in a country when there is not WIFI access even in the hotel. The USB-C to hdmi adapter is really expensive from Apple which is not even multi functional. With this hub it can meets all I need and save money.

Once you plug this into your laptop, you can connect up to three other devices using the hub’s usb, another via hdmi for screens. In addition, there’s an Ethernet port for hotels that have extremely slow WiFi (we all know which brands of hotels those are eh), and two for SD cards.I will mainly be using these to charge my laptop at the same time with my phone, tablet, GoPro, and backup batteries. When you’re traveling in countries like Europe, some hotels have limited outlets. And if you’re staying at hostels, you might just have one that is available. Having this will allow you to charge everything overnight at once so that you’ll have all the juice needed for the next day.

",0.1607849325,pc," Coming from a Fire HD 7, then a ""Kids"" Kindle 8, this is really an impressive and welcome upgrade.So I really want, and need, to explain that the only difference between the ""kids edition"" and the regular one, other than price, is that the ""kids edition"" comes with--A kidproof case (and this one even has a kickstand!!) Which yes, the kindle kid cases are amazing with protection.-The year of Free Time, which is the kids gaming platform.-The 2 year replacement guarantee (that I have used in the past for a broken screen. SUPER easy process. You have to CALL Amazon to do this, it cannot be done via your order page; Return the kindle without case to Amazon, they ship you a replacement kindle without the case.)O N L Y differences. So when I see all of these negative reviews about the kids kindle, then I jump over to the positive reviews on the normal kindle, it's baffling. And I did compare the two because it's a $50 price difference, and what really sold this version for me, rather than buying everything separately, was the 2 year replacement guarantee.My child started out with my Fire HD 7, which you can switch between adult and kid profiles on as well. Any kindle can be a kids kindle as long as you've got a childs profile set up. Once she got bigger/older, we bought her the kids edition 8. So the kids edition 10 is her Christmas gift this year. It's so much faster than the 8, obviously bigger. And I loved that with having it connected to my account before shipment, setup was fast-All the hard work was done and I just had to select a pin for this device, it was set up and ready to go within 10 minutes. Memory card slot on the side, removal and replacement of the case is MUCH easier than on the 8. The volume on this thing is loud, crisp, and clear.With the 10, the only differences I've noticed that would be worth mentioning is that usually on the other kindles, you would pull down the settings bar to click on the icon and switch profiles. With this one it seems you've got to lock, click the icon, then switch profiles. Not a big deal to me and I'm sure it wont be to her. She uses my profile for regular youtube and roblox, just normal things that aren't accessible on the kids/free time dashboard. Other difference here is that it now uses a USBC charger, which is another positive since every phone in my house uses USBC so it's easier to replace and keep up with.The free time dashboard. Lots of negative feedback on that one; So sometime ago, maybe in the last year or 2 I think, free time had an update. I HATED the update. It jumbled literally everything together and she had to look for all of her downloaded games, just randomly clicking on everything. But this was a year or 2 ago and the dashboard on the 10 is no different than the dash on the 7 and 8. It's just the same free time update that's been there for a year or 2 now.She has an ipad air that we have her school apps on. They weren't available on kindle so we keep the ipad around for homework. She absolutely hates the ipad. So if your kid is an apple fan, they may not like this one. My daughter had 2 kindles before she got an ipad from a relative so she was already used to the interface. iPad is easy for her too but she would rather not use anything, than reach for the ipad when the kindle is dead/charging.For anyone wanting more in depth reviews on this Kindle, jump on over to the Kindle 10 listing and read them there because there is virtually no difference between the ""Kids Edition"" and the regular 10.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1526,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971526,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

",0.2009450226,pc,"I l logged in to increase my rating but my review was not there.  In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.

",0.84786665427,pc," Coming from a Fire HD 7, then a ""Kids"" Kindle 8, this is really an impressive and welcome upgrade.So I really want, and need, to explain that the only difference between the ""kids edition"" and the regular one, other than price, is that the ""kids edition"" comes with--A kidproof case (and this one even has a kickstand!!) Which yes, the kindle kid cases are amazing with protection.-The year of Free Time, which is the kids gaming platform.-The 2 year replacement guarantee (that I have used in the past for a broken screen. SUPER easy process. You have to CALL Amazon to do this, it cannot be done via your order page; Return the kindle without case to Amazon, they ship you a replacement kindle without the case.)O N L Y differences. So when I see all of these negative reviews about the kids kindle, then I jump over to the positive reviews on the normal kindle, it's baffling. And I did compare the two because it's a $50 price difference, and what really sold this version for me, rather than buying everything separately, was the 2 year replacement guarantee.My child started out with my Fire HD 7, which you can switch between adult and kid profiles on as well. Any kindle can be a kids kindle as long as you've got a childs profile set up. Once she got bigger/older, we bought her the kids edition 8. So the kids edition 10 is her Christmas gift this year. It's so much faster than the 8, obviously bigger. And I loved that with having it connected to my account before shipment, setup was fast-All the hard work was done and I just had to select a pin for this device, it was set up and ready to go within 10 minutes. Memory card slot on the side, removal and replacement of the case is MUCH easier than on the 8. The volume on this thing is loud, crisp, and clear.With the 10, the only differences I've noticed that would be worth mentioning is that usually on the other kindles, you would pull down the settings bar to click on the icon and switch profiles. With this one it seems you've got to lock, click the icon, then switch profiles. Not a big deal to me and I'm sure it wont be to her. She uses my profile for regular youtube and roblox, just normal things that aren't accessible on the kids/free time dashboard. Other difference here is that it now uses a USBC charger, which is another positive since every phone in my house uses USBC so it's easier to replace and keep up with.The free time dashboard. Lots of negative feedback on that one; So sometime ago, maybe in the last year or 2 I think, free time had an update. I HATED the update. It jumbled literally everything together and she had to look for all of her downloaded games, just randomly clicking on everything. But this was a year or 2 ago and the dashboard on the 10 is no different than the dash on the 7 and 8. It's just the same free time update that's been there for a year or 2 now.She has an ipad air that we have her school apps on. They weren't available on kindle so we keep the ipad around for homework. She absolutely hates the ipad. So if your kid is an apple fan, they may not like this one. My daughter had 2 kindles before she got an ipad from a relative so she was already used to the interface. iPad is easy for her too but she would rather not use anything, than reach for the ipad when the kindle is dead/charging.For anyone wanting more in depth reviews on this Kindle, jump on over to the Kindle 10 listing and read them there because there is virtually no difference between the ""Kids Edition"" and the regular 10.
",0.82590067427,pc," Amazon rushed this product. The tablet itself is so flimsy the screen is discolored and you barely push on it and it looks like the screen is going to break.

The USB-C charges faster and in either direction, so I don't have to fumble around flipping the micro USB if it's dark.  However the included charger here is only 9W.  My chargers at home are 15 or 18W so I don't use the 9W one at all.I am docking 1 star on this because I can no longer install apps onto the microSD card.  That was possible on old Kids Fire tablets.I bought 2 of these at a 2 for 1 discount.  I also sent in my old Kids Fire 10 for a $30 gift card.  These are for my little toddler boys, who love them.

I knew I didn't need a ton of horse power on it, and the price had to be cheap.This tablet for the bill. It was cheap, small and portable, and it already comes with Android 8 plus a bunch of kids games pre installed on it. The carrying case it came with is sturdy, so I'm not worried about my son or daughter dropping it. For the most part I can tell it has a pretty stock version of Android installed. So I could install apps from the play store easily. For my use cases, the tablet was surprisingly useable. I thought the performance would be horrible, but given the price point it's actually pretty good. Its not your high end tablet snappy, but this is better than my fire 8, which sometimes has trouble switching apps and scrolling.If you are looking for a cheap tablet for your kids, I would recommend this one.

",0.99292588228,pc,"I’ve been wanting a basic tablet for my 3 year old son so when I saw this one was geared towards kids I decided to get it.The tablet itself is the perfect size to fit in his hands and the case does a great job at protecting the tablet when it gets dropped. (Because we all know 3 year olds drop things)The tablet comes preinstalled with 20 different games that work for many different age groups. The Looney Tunes Phonics game is one of them and it’s excellent at teaching letters and the sounds they make. My son is around the age of learning letters and sounds so we’ve used this a few times and will continue to. A few apps he personally likes to play are ABC world, Game kids 5 and body parts for kids. (All are preinstalled on the tablet).Another great thing about this tablet is the parental controls. I honestly had to unblock a few things when I first got the tablet because so many things were blocked. The “kids corner” app is where all of the apps you want your child to use can be put into. This app is password protected so you can’t get out of it unless you use a password, so no worrying about your child getting into other things on the tablet that you don’t want them to use. You can also set a timer for how long you want your child to be on the tablet.The operating system is ok, it runs on Android 8, it’s not the fastest thing in the world so it takes patience for some of the things to load and the touch screen can be finicky at times but he’s able to play games ok. I’m not sure if I got a bad one or not but the charging cord and port are loose so I’m not sure how long the charger is going to last.  The tablet can also get a little warm at times but all and all it’s a nice basic tablet.Updated 11/1/19: I have revised my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because of the excellent customer service I received about the loose charger (which actually did end up breaking after my initial review) . I emailed Contixo and told them what happened with my charger and they sent out a new one to me free of charge!
",0.23641517828,pc,"This tablet is really good because is comes with a lot of preinstalled app, has parental controls with Kids Place, and works good for an affordable tablet.  The case has a nice feel..  My daughter uses the tablet while I am busy cooking or cleaning, and gives me a chance to manage household chores uninterrupted.  She likes the YouTube kids apps, which allows her to watch cartoons, kids shows or listen to music.  She needed help with getting interested in some homework (recognizing sight words), and we found some apps in the playstore that did mostly what we wanted, but the issues were not the tablets fault.  The games work fine and she seems to learn how to maneuver around pretty good.  She is a fast learner.  I just have to remember to keep it charged up, but it makes life so much easier.  She was so excited to open it, and often asks to play on it.
",0.92652428228,pc," We bought this for our 4 year old, who was feeling left out because his older brothers have their own tablets. We decided to get him an inexpensive tablet with a few educational games. This has turned out to be nicer than our other tablets! There are lots of apps/games already installed, and we linked it to our Google account so it easily synched with the other apps and games we've purchased for our phones. It's simple to use so far. Fast processing speed and responsive touch screen. We like to monitor and limit our kids' use of technology, so parental controls are a must-- we were able to easily disable apps we don't want our son to access freely. The tablet came fully charged and ready to go, complete with a cover to protect it from the inevitable drops. Very impressed with the speed, capabilities, and storage for the price.
",0.91512072128,pc,"This tablet is perfect. Bought for our 4 year old daughter. Didn't wanna spend a fortune because we weren't 100 percent on how well she would care for it so the fact that it comes with a case is a major plus! The sound is really good on the tablet too. The picture is awesome too. This tablet is worth every penny.
",0.95987558428,pc,"I finally made a decision to purchase this one over IOS. I have been into Androids lately and also for price consideration, this one save my pocket from draining. I am glad to purchase this and feel great about my decision. This is a super cute tablet and the size is so mini — it’s perfect for little kid. The case is a thick and durable rubber material. I chose baby blue color and is suitable for my son. The design of the case is protecting the tablet from dropping. There are also three layers of screen protector that prevents it from scratch and it’s also dust proof. The battery life is also great, without internet it can lasts up to half day with continuous usage. You can store and download the video inside. The memory is 16GB but you can slot SD card up to 128GB and that’s a lot of storage for kids. The screen is perfect for little eyes and very bright enough. This is the best way to occupy my son while travel in the car. This tablet has Looney Tunes Phonics games feature that is very educational. It also equipped with parental supervision so that kids won’t browse something that he shouldn’t. You can download the app and the content will improve by time so kids can get an up-to-date subjects all the times. Love this mini tablet!
",0.97867035928,pc,"This is 7 inch kids tablet with a lot of in built apps and looney tunes content. Any kid would love using it. It has good speaker volume and touch screen works perfect. It is cheap in price and very durable. I only wish if it could have more storage than 16 gb. But for kids usage, storage is quite good.
",0.89433467428,pc,"Absolutely awesome! I love the the silicone case, makes it so easy for my toddler to hold it and not drop it. Plus it’s so lightweight and thin!! Perfect for a young kid or toddler!
",0.96391916328,pc,"I bought this to take along on a flight with my toddler because I wanted to avoid the tantrums along the journey. I really liked that the battery survived throughout and moreover I didn't had to worry what my child is watching because it comes with preloaded videos and games for kids. This is inexpensive yet does the job pretty good.
",0.77509504629,pc,"Out of the box I had this together in 15 minutes. Out to my target I went, only to find the speed and power were far too great..First arrow went sailing through removing the fetchings and burying the arrow... Second arrow was placed in the quiver only to be released on a new target.. oh yeah, follow the cocking instructions, I went with the ""man"" way and threw my back out.. wicked.This is my first crossbow, the speed and power compared to my compound is amazing, it is loud compared to a compound so I am interested to see how the deer jump the string.Bring on bow season (I'm still amazed they allow these in the same class as a bow).I'm excited to get a target and put this beast to the test. So far I am amazed at the speed and power.The scope is ok, but I'm sure there are better available. I will give this one a shot or two first.
",0.88743984729,pc,"I got home from work at 4:15 and by 5:15, I was shooting at targets. Needing only one bolt, it was easy to assemble out of the box. I shot at target 5 times and I seemed to be hitting 2 inches high but dead center. Not bad for out of the box sighting. I probably need a little practice as well. This is the first crossbow I have owned although,  I have fired them before. With a little range time, I'm sure my accuracy will improve. I feel that for the money, it is a decent weapon.
",0.2254031629,pc,"Happen to pick this up on prime day with the discount and was surprised big time when I got the box. Not sure if everyone know this but the sku on the box is for the lowest end version of this crossbow with an MSRP of $399. But the pictures show a different version, I was concerned that it may not show up with all the extra goodies. To my surprised this bow came as depicted in the picture and actually is the upgraded model with the sku ending in a 4, I believe dick's sporting good has this version for sale around $599. Not sure how this worked out but it is a great crossbow for the money. Didn't take long to sight in but haven't had the time to fine tune it. It is light, very adjustable and the trigger is surprisingly smooth. Can't wait to use it this upcoming hunting season.**UPDATE**Made it through first archery season so I thought I would update the review. Was able to take a buck with this at 44 yards (will state that I was in a 20' high stand shooting down hill so the actual distance may have been further, range finder takes angle into consideration). Great through and through shot, right on the money. I also used the barnett decocking arrow all season and it worked flawlessly with this bow. The only issue I have is that the paint on the limbs is starting to peel but it does not affect the performance of the bow. I look forward to fine tuning and using again in a year.
",0.87199968129,pc,"Absolute beauty and performance is out of this world. It literally has recoil like a low powered rifle. Youll have to buy a very stout target. Shot it three times yesterday just to feel it. 2 out of those shots were in the same hole. Will be sighting it in this upcoming week so I can focus on getting everything else ready for the season. Oh and by the way this is a mans bow. Not something a teenager or average woman would be able to cock. Just so ya know.

Makes life a lot easier de-cocking your crossbow after an unsuccessful hunt.I read that it wasn’t recommended for a female due to complications with cocking. I’m 5’3” and weigh 172lb and have no problem cocking using the cocking rope.

Shot high with first shot but was able to sight crossbow in with in 10 shots at 17 yards. Have yet to use in the field but I feel confident with the crossbow.

",0.80464309530,pc,"Pros:• USB-C, Finally! As a past Surface Pro user, this was never a feature. With a USB-C, like any computer, you can do so much more with this device now. From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.• It’s a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.• It’s light. Not IPad light, but enough that you won’t feel worried that you’re not going to bend it.• The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.• Cortana listens to you pretty well. I’m learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.• Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.• Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when it’s placed on my lap.• microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)• Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if you’re planning to edit videos on this.• Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and• Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don’t expect the same results when using an off-brand.• A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.• The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.• The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it’s quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.• I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.Cons and Oks:• The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can’t be ignored in 2019. It’s very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).• With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.• Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it’ll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.• The battery life isn’t great. I’m getting around 8 hours of power. That’s having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it’s nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.• Don’t take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.• Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn’t test these as you only get the tablet.• Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we’re already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.• I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn’t for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.Bottom Line:If you’re going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It’s disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you’re pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can’t attach them to the Surface Pro.Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less. I have the previous model on hand and I can’t tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I’m also irritated that Microsoft didn’t at least try to improve the design.But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you’ll know that Microsoft put all their money on what’s inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that’s the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I’m always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can’t do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you’re getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer

",0.05782234733,pc,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1533,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971533,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand.

If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1534,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971534,pc,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.

",0.84786665435,pc,"Pros:__________• The tablet design is almost an uncanny resemblance to the IPad Pro. Pencil thin, smooth corners, and overall minimalistic design. This is a premium feel all around.• The screen is beautiful in every way. I want to highlight that the blacks are excellent and color context matches the brightness level you apply for the screen. For this to be an HDR10+ certification in viewing, I have nothing bad to see on this.• Watching YouTube videos at 1444p make this tablet one of the best in viewings. No more generic 1080p.• The bezels fit well with this tablet. Because of how light it is, I can use one hand to hold it without any issues, and I have enough room so I don’t touch the screen. One of few times that a bezel design comes in handy.• Don’t worry, the bezel layout is small enough to create an immersive experience, especially at night.• The aluminum back reduces the fingerprints for just the screen and provides a little more protection if you drop it. I never loved the glass back and Samsung has listened.• The S-Pen also has a minimalist design that fits right in the back of the tablet. Nothing on look and feel doesn’t create the impression of being cheap.• Got to love the USB-C port. Fast charging, importing, exporting files, and cheap to get extra chargers for the S6.• The S-Pen Air Action gestures are more useful than Samsung’s previous products. Because of the size of the screen, I found even swiping left to right and switching cameras an easy perk when using the Air Actions.  I can see anyone who wants to make PowerPoint presentations with the S6 a great selling point, as the S-Pen does a decent job with the simple Air Actions.• Very comfortable to write with the S-Pen (more details later on). Smooth and the right amount of pressure.• A battery notification immediately pops up on the right side of the screen every time I put the S-Pen back in its location (which has some magnets). I didn’t realize who useful this is since the notification lets me know if didn’t place the S-Pen in the correct location.• I got around 90 minutes for a full charge of the S-Pen, but you really shouldn’t worry as it will always charge on the S6.• I’m happy that you can attach the S-Pen on the side of the screen when you’re not using it, just like the IPad does for their pen.• Multi-tasking is spot-on. Samsung offers a lot of little software perks that makes multi-tasking not only easy, but I felt use this feature on a daily basis.• With the one button on the S-Pen has, you can customize to what you want to open with it.• I’m never a fan with tablet cameras, due to most phones have better equipment, but I got to hand it to Samsung on the built-in ultra-wide lens mode. An insane 123 degree made taking a picture with anything, show the whole world around it. For a quick family photo, it’s perfect. But then again your phone should be your main camera.• The gaming on this is very pleasant. I advise that when playing any high power game you switch the Samsung’s new feature called Game Booster. This feature will kill any apps that are taking away power from the tablet, so you can have more hours of gaming.  I didn’t test the comparison of how much a difference, but when playing any game on a tablet you want as much power as you can.• Playing Fortnite gave me 30fps and no lag what so ever.• One awesome feature Samsung has is the Transparency option. It’s basically a white page over your screen, which is transparent, so you can write on it while reading or watching a video.  I found this feature an excellent perk for taking notes or reading anything on the web. Everyone will find this very useful to have.• Dex Launch is pretty on point of what a windows desktop looks like. It takes around 5 seconds to load up, but when done, it looks like you’re staring into a Windows OS. Overall the layout works fine as one cool benefit I found is any app you click in DeX mode will pop up as a small window, rather than taking over the screen as a whole (no lag when I was watching Netflix in Dex mode). Also moving back and forth from android to Dex is a quick experience.• Battery life I’m getting around 13-14 hours. That’s around 70% brightness, mostly web and movie watching.  The killer in this is the gaming and the pen, if you’re using it a lot.• As you may already know, with this price, you know it’s fast. Opening up 10 apps, numerous web browsers, and an active gaming, the S6 took it in quite well.  For the average day speed will not be a problem.• Cheaper than an IPad Pro, and you get a Pen.• If you have ever used a Samsung device, you’ll feel right at home.Cons and Oks:__________• The fingerprint scanner is an optical sensor. It’s embedded in the screen but, not being an ultrasonic scanner, it can be fooled. With the technology of ultrasonic scanner already established, why install this? But it’s still responsive so it depends on your security requirements (You can just make a passcode if you’re still unsure).• Not headphone jack. A big turn off for those who see this for video editing on the go, or really anyone.• I’m not a fan of having the S-Pen in the back of the tablet.  Not only does it increase the chances of getting scratched when placing it back there, but the magnets on the back are not strong enough to make sure that the S-Pen stays on. You place the tablet on the ground, the S-Pen is the only form of contact with the surface are you place it on.• It’s a hassle to find the right location on placing the S-Pen correctly.  The back has a dip in the section where the pen goes but if you don’t put it in the correct way the S-Pen will fall off.  I have to make sure that it’s attached correctly because it’s impossible to identify, by touch, in which way to put the pen. There is a notification on screen to tell you when it’s connected, but why could’ve they create the charging station on the side so we not only put it in the right place, but we can see it all the time.• What I love about Samsung Galaxy Phones is the ability of how they hid their S-Pens, but this one is not hidden at all. To me, it feels similar to carrying the headphone jack adaptor. I’m not going to use all the time, but I still need to carry it because I may use it at random times.• The way Samsung design this, if you lose the S-Pen you feel like you lost a part of the tablet. With the open face S-Pen placement design in the back, if you lose the pen then it just likes a tablet with a dent in the back.• The Air Action gestures are only good for PowerPoint presentations and taking pictures. I couldn’t see the benefit of using this feature other than that.• As a personal video editor, this isn’t the best around. The S6 struggles to import 4k videos and it took numerous hours to encode an 8-minute video. Keep in mind that I had a decent amount of layers, but it’s still something to know if you wanted to know how fast exporting with Adobe is. Also note that editing in the program, while using the S-Pen, is excellent.• A major issue when drawing with this is the S-Pen’s shortcut button on it. I used the app Medibang Paint, and when drawing I’ll always press the shortcut button on the S-Pen by mistake. The way the button is designed, it’s right where your hand grip is when you write. Numerous times I was would be drawing and hand would press the S-Pen button.  This would immediately bring me to the shortcut page. I don’t know if this is an app issue, but this button problem needs to be fixed.• There is still a gap when you move with the S-Pen. It’s not much, but it’s there. I still had no issues to write notes with, but for those who want to draw it’s a heads up.• It does have face unlock, but it’s a 2D-based facial recognition. I’ll trust the fingerprint scanner first.• The camera is decent but even the ultra-wide format I saw it in a lower resolution. Stick to your phone. Video calls are fine, but other than that, forget it.• Again, the way Samsung design the tablet, because of the built-in S-Pen charging design, you’re somewhat forced to folk over $179 for “there” book cover. Because of the S-Pen, you have no choice if you don’t want the S-Pen to get scratch, or lost.• The speakers are decent, you get four of them.  I found the sound is very clear and loud.• Bixby voice command is the same throughout Samsung’s devices. The microphone the S6 has I didn’t get any issues of feedback.•  It’s very thin, but will bend if semi-force is applied.Bottom Line:__________Samsung for the past year has up its game in phones and tablets. Having posted reviews of their phones and tablets I can say that the S6 is another one in the books, but does have noticeable drawbacks.To summarize, if you want an IPad Pro but can’t afford it, then this what you’ll buy. The S6 is very fast, doesn’t heat up in gaming or video editing, and it’s a definite win for those who need to take notes (work, college, etc.). It has a beautiful image resolution with the bonus of having there S-Pen. I know that the goal Samsung is after the same as Apple, a replacement for the common laptop, and the S6 is right on point. If you get the keyboard cover than you have a pretty good package of the tablet, a pen, and a keyboard (with a trackpad!).But I think Samsung’s goal is also the problem.  They’re trying to make a laptop replacement with a tablet that lacks the internal hardware to support it. For web and basic programs, this is sure a good find, but other than that you start getting issues. On the design side, I’m not a fan of the S-Pen layout. You’re not going to use the S-Pen every time, but the way the S-Pen is placed, you’ll have to make sure that its place correctly. This could’ve been fixed if they added more magnets in the S-Pen holder.In the end, it’s a lower IPad Pro replacement. Still very fast and effective, but graphic power still goes to the IPad Pro as well as the Apple Pen.  With Samsung’s Android OS on their phones, in this tablet, and the upcoming watch, Samsung wants to be your only tech user.Overall: A great tablet for the day to day drawers and note-takers, but still not a laptop replacement.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer
",0.535,pc,"I received the Samsung Tab S6 the day it was released, which was nice. It has a beautiful display. As a photographer, my pictures look really good. So far I've discovered a couple of downsides that would make me consider returning it. I purchased a 512 gb microsd card for it and that works super. The Samsung SmartSwitch software allowed me to transfer my current Note 8's information to the S6 in about 40 minutes. I had a ton of data on the Note 8 with a 128 gb microsd card and the wireless transfer was much faster than expected. It transferred all of my installed apps along with the data. I didn't realize it but my wake up alarm this morning came from both my phone and tablet! LOLThe magnetic stylus which is clipped to the back will fall off a lot of the time, especially if you put it down. The stylus is attached via a small grove and is connected via a magnet. I've already lost it several times and had to spend a lot of time searching for it. I have the keyboard cover on order which is supposed to arrive next week. That has a cover which I think will cover up the stylus and keep it in place. I would NOT recommend buying the unit unless you buy the cover which is another $170 or $90 if you buy soon.The next problem is the unit is too big to hold with one hand and is slippery. It will slide out of your grip easily and there goes $800 to the floor. Depending on what you're doing the thin bezels mean that you have to put your thumb on the display to hold it with one hand and I found that I kept accidentally selecting a link on the side of the display. Plan on using it with both hands without a cover to hold onto. Hopefully the cover will make it easier to handle.All of the videos hyping the unit seem to always show the tablet on a stand or with the keyboard cover attached. I've yet to see one review with someone trying to hold the tablet by itself. The tablet is so wide that it's a stretch for me to hold the opposite edge so my other hand is free to do other things. After a few minutes, my hand gets cramped from reaching across the tablet and hold it. If you put a thumb on the display to hold it with one hand, if there is a clickable area under your thumb, you will accidentally do something unexpected.In retrospect, I would not buy this tablet. It costs almost as much as my MacBook Air which is a real computer but I'm a sucker for new shiny things.  May revisit this review after a little time but I spent almost $900 after tax on the top of the line unit and it is not as neat as I hoped. It is unbelievably light!Update 9/9/19 - After a couple of days of usage, my comments are still pretty much the same. By itself, the tablet is difficult to use one handed due to its size and tiny bezels. Plus, I've discovered that the screen lock will often lock up the unit and not allow you to unlock the screen. Swiping up the display does nothing and it doesn't recognize my fingerprint, or face. When this happens, it's taken a lot of trial and error to get it unlocked. It's like the unit sees the request to unlock but doesn't do anything. This only seems to happen when the tablet has been asleep for a while, such as overnight.On a positive note, battery life seems really good. If you put the unit down overnight it will only lose a percent or two of battery after sleeping overnight.The Samsung Tab S6 is FAST! I have a Nexus 7 and another 7 inch tablet and this one runs rings around them. Looking at photos which are 1-2 mb in file size, you can instantly flip between pictures. If I could hold it, I think I'd love it and Amazon has just updated the ship schedule for the Keyboard cover to arrive in three days. I can't wait.
",0.18428483635,pc,"Updated review after 2nd keyboard cover delivered.I have removed 2 stars. I purchased this device as a work device. However, the $180 keyboard stand designed for the tablet does NOT stay on reliably. The design is not good, and at angles, air is allowed to leak into the back suction cup and the tablet slaps onto the table. It happens every time I have it in my lap, and often when just on a desk.Because this is touted as a ""laptop replacement"", and the thing that makes it a laptop is unusable, I cannot recommend it. Wait until next year.Updated review after one week:I've received the keyboard cover, and while I love it, I am skeptical about the adhesive on the back. Last night I could not get it to stay on, so I cleaned the adhesive and left it stuck overnight, and now it seems better. I have a replacement coming from amazon, because I have very little faith in this one.Apart from that, the keyboard is amazing. it feels great to type on, and the shortucts are very useful. I am not a fan of the tiny backspace key, but overall it is a reasonable compromise. The addition of the trackpad turns it from a ""dockable PC replacement"" to a true laptop replacement.My favorite samsung S-Pen enabled tablet up until this point was the Note 12.2. Even though I liked the tab S4, there were several annoying factors. If you want to use DeX, you really need the device propped upright, and you need either a better face scanner or a fingerprint sensor. Trust me, you'd understand if you tried it on the S4.With the S4, I immediately had speaker envy vs my wife's iPad pro. The sound wasn't even comparable. Given that this is a significant media consumption device, having excellent speakers is a must. The tab S6 speakers sound nearly as good as the iPad pro. They are excellent, and you won't be disappointed.The in-display fingerprint sensor is really great. I have had no problem with lag or unrecognized fingers. Not much more to say, except that it greatly improves the DeX experience and the overall usability. No more looking at the camera at the top of the device, or even worse, when the device is in landscape, trying to figure out where to put your eyes so the camera can see it.Face ID on the iPad pro is so good that you don't have to go through those hoops... but samsung took the easy way out and put in the optical reader under the screen, and I'm really glad they did. I like it better.The S-Pen feels better. I get far fewer unintentional clicks of the button than the bigger round one on the S4. The concept of where they put the pen actually makes sense. Take an iPad with the Pencil... if you want a case, you have to either have one side of the iPad naked, or have some weird extension. The extension makes sense, so you don't lose the Pencil. BUT, if it's on the back, you still have the slim tablet profile, and you don't need a wider case to hold.I had a generic TPU case until I got my official cover in, and just having a case on it makes putting the pencil away MUCH easier.I ALWAYS recommend official samsung cases, as they fit best and feel professional. They are expensive, but worth it.I'm super disappointed that there is no flash on the camera. It really makes a big difference if you scan documents with your tablet. The Note (read: S-pen enabled devices) lineup has always been about productivity, and that means marking up PDFs and photos. Even in Okay lighting, scanning documents requires more light, and a flash should  just be common sense.As for the rest: I got the 6gb 128gb version. My tab S4 had no problem with a million windows, and it had 4gb of ram. This one is quite fast, and handles all of the apps just fine, never any lag with microsoft office and the internet and Adobe running. If you want to photoshop, I always recommend the highest specs possible though.The tablet is thin and light and impressive to hold. The screen is samsung amazing. One UI version 2.0 feels great to use.-Bluetooth 5.0 is nice.- I'd like the bezels to be smaller and the screen to be bigger. I'd gladly buy a 12 inch Tab S6.- Having the SMS messages synced to the tablet makes me so happy. (verizon customers, you are out of luck)- I with there were games optimized for a keyboard in DeX. I'd waste some time on that.- I love the way the case feels
",0.8215653935,pc,"After having bought this tablet and used it for a couple of days, that was what I was asking myself, “who is this for, exactly?” Let’s just say Samsung isn’t reigniting the tablet wars anytime soon with the Tab S6, that War was won, long ago, by Apple. But I really missed the Android eco system, I hadn’t owned a non-Apple tablet in years, the Tab S2, to be exact. I did purchase Google’s Pixel Slate, briefly, in a previous attempt to return to the green guy, but found it to be too unwieldy, buggy, and just plain expensive to justify keeping it.That all being said, I thought the Tab S6 was a bit on the pricy side, but not nearly so much as the Pixel Slate, even with the keyboard, and as Samsung is the biggest Android show in town, it’d be a good place to start again with the OS.I was wrong. I feel like, ultimately, Android doesn’t work on tablets. It’s, as I said before, too unwieldy. Use an Android tablet a day, then use an iPad the following day, you cannot tell me the iPad experience isn’t just more fluid, more usable, just better. But the OS itself wasn’t enough for me to give up on the Tab S6, it also promised great sound, DEX, a desktop environment with the Tab S6, when you add an “optional” $170 keyboard, and a great screen.The Tab S6 delivers on two of these promises, but the 3rd is so poorly done that it ended my experience with this tablet.The sound, is quite good, especially for the size and form factor of the tablet.The screen is very nice. Usual overblown saturated Samsung AMOLED screens, but it looks good and blacks are true.Dex? Horrible. First of all, I remind you that on a tablet that is definitely advertised as a laptop replacement, does not include said tablet. Would these tablet manufacturers PLEASE STOP advertising a product as a tablet replacement and then not include the keyboard? When I add the 170 to the standard 650-750 price for the tablet, and now my “laptop replacement” is pushing well over 900 bucks...might as well get a laptop, right? The CPU / RAM will easily exceed what’s in the S6. And if you want a tablet only device, the newest non-pro iPad has a beautiful screen, great speakers too, and costs about 1/2 as much as the S6.Back to Dex, the reason why it is terrible is that A) you must attach the “optional” keyboard to even use it. B) most, and I mean most, of your Android apps will be nonfunctional in Dex mode, so what’s even the point of it? I don’t need a desktop environment to surf the web, which is all you’ll be doing in Dex mode anyway. It’s just a stupid desktop-like experience to try to justify making you spend 170 just to get into it.So, if you want a pure Android tablet, there are 1000 varieties, much cheaper. Heck, a Amazon Fire tablet is so much cheaper and will give you your basic android experience, buy it instead. If you want a great tablet, buy the cheapest new regular iPad. If you want a tablet that can truly replace a laptop, get an iPad Pro with a brydge keyboard, they are fantastic. But if you truly want an Android/tablet hybrid? Chrome book!! I replaced this with a Pixel book, so much better keyboard, it’s backlit (Tab S6 keyboard is not backlit, for 170? whatever), it still has a good touchscreen, and the Android integration actually works...usually.
",0.89995825335,pc,"I had an Apple iPad Air 2 for four years,  used it 3+ hours a day for news reading and other stuff during that period everyday. It worked great but recently the battery went down quicker than I'd like and processing became a bit sluggish on certain websites and apps.  Understandable given its age.  I selected this S6 over a new iPad pro because of its slightly smaller size and weight,  and slightly higher performance. I've always used Galaxy phones, so Android and iOS both are familiar to me.THE GOOD- Fast.  Nothing surprising given the enhancement in predecessor and RAM.- Swype. Typing on the iPad sucked. It's so much easier on the Tab with Swype.- Transitioning preferences and apps from my galaxy phone worked quite well,  saved time from downloading all of the apps individually (over 100). Took over pw's too.THE BAD- The pen on the back thing is stupid.  The guy who invented this and managed who approved should be fired. This is as dumb as those ridiculous galaxy fold issues.- The fingerprint sensor takes 2+ tries to get in.- Browsers.  I guess I got used to Safari, but I'm spending a lot of time trying to figure out which browser i should use as my primary,  and all have issues... Firefox,  Samsung, Edge, Chrome.- Same with the Samsung Note app. It sucks, big time. Why would you add a pen without a sophisticated note app. Again, heads at Samsung should roll for this incompetence.In summary, this tab is what I'd expect after a four year upgrade from an iPad Air 2, but nothing more,  and nothing terribly innovative.
",0.14382559135,pc,"Nice concept and I believe it's Samsung's best tablet yet. However, for $650-$700 (including taxes and accessories) it has too many short comings that leaves much to be desired. It blows my mind that THEY thought it would be a good idea to add a magnetic stylus to the BACK of the device vice somewhere on the sides (top, bottom, left/right). The ""magnetic force"" isn't all that strong so a case for protection is strongly recommended. That isn't the worst of it! The stylus can be laid on either side to attach BUT it has to be on the CORRECT side for charging. SMH. That is so ANNOYING!!! I'm not a fan of Apple but I can appreciate them perfecting this issue BEFORE IT BECAME AN ISSUE!!! And I will never understand for the life of me why they used old in screen fingerprint reader technology on a ""just hit the market"" device that costs $650-$700!!! It has been years since I've purchased any more Samsung tablets so I was excited to get this one but only to be regretfully disappointed. With that being said, this tablet has been returned and I await their next one with my fingers crossed.
",0.13719165335,pc,"I was really looking forward to my new Samsung Galaxy Tab S6. Please look over the item description... the offer has four months YouTube Premium at no charge included with purchase. I've called Amazon twice (each over 30 minutes - thanks Esther D. for making the phone call long while you cut-n-pasted the unhelpful email - I waxed my car hood while you composed the email, that is the moment the return decision was made) and I've called Samsung.... nobody can help with this simple request. I'm sending it back to Amazon to purchase elsewhere... maybe...poor service from both Amazon and Samsung is making the IPad Pro look attractive.For the tablet - I purchased to use with Lightroom and light office work while visiting friends and family. For the week it has been put to use; Lightroom CC mobile (subscription version) the Tab S6 is quick and the screen beautiful! The stylus makes quick and easy edits! Love it! My light office work is emails, MS Word Docs, PP, and Excel - the Tab S6 handles with eaze.Ths battery life  suits my day away from home- downloading images in the field via cable connection with editing taking about two-three hours. Uploading when I get home.I'm returning because Amazon can not live up to their end of the deal. They had the chance when on the phone with customer service for way too long.
",0.79902410535,pc," When I first received it I was blown away by how well it could handle the multitask. Watching videos and playing games with this this tab is just amazing! Taking down notes and drawing too! But, everything started to go downhill from here as I noticed the digitizer faulty. The screen started ""ghost tapping"" and I had to return the product for a lost. Still, good product tho but I received a faulty one. But I'm giving it 1 star for my experience.
",0.24814575935,pc,"I bought this for upcoming travel.  I wanted to replace my laptop with something lighter.  It had potential but there were two huge problems. #1 is the included stylus kept falling off.  For travel, the stylus would be lost in a day or two.  If you get this, you will NEED a case or cover that helps hold the stylus.  The second and larger issue is the secrren has horrible touch sensativity.  it literally would not detect my finger touching it unless I licked the tip of my finger to make it wet and that only lasted for a few swipes.  This made it totally unusable as I'd use my finger 99% of the time.  I tried for a few hours and finally gave up in frustration.  I ran updates, but no improvement.I later purchased a Samsung Note S5e from Amazon and it is a huge improvement in sensativity.  I'd give the S6 a 1/10 for the touch screen.  I'd give the S5e a 8/10 on the touchscreen.  Touch sensativity was not as nice as my cell phone, but perfectly acceptable.  I also noticed the S6 and the S5e had very comparable and fast performance with day to day application usage even though the S6 has a more powerful CPU.The thing I liked the most about the S6 (and S5e also) was the beautiful screen display.

The colors of the mouse's lights are very pretty and I'm a big fan of how customizable they are. Worth the price.
",0.82260227238,pc," To start off, this mouse uses a PixArt PMW3327 sensor, which is an improvement over the previous budget PMW3325 model, so you already know this mouse has very precise tracking. Polling rate is 1000Hz; Entire upper surface is anti-grip, better than my SteelSeries 310; RGB is good though transition between color is not as smooth as other $100+ mouse, but that does not affect performance in anyway. The hump is towards the back of the mouse, which reminds me of the DeathAdder, so it is great for 20 cm hands palm grip. What I appreciate the most about this mouse is the fact that the 3 buttons in the middle (DPI+, DPI-, change color effect) is completely out of the way and lie perfecty in the middle when I'm jitterclicking people in Minecraft.

The weights came pre-installed, which is a shame because they don't seem to help much.  It's still VERY light. It doesn't feel like a premium gaming mouse. It feels like a cheap mouse with gaming features (which it is). If you think you're getting Logitech quality for 1/4 of the price, you're not. You're getting decent software with a cheap, plasticy mouse that has somewhat mediocre feeling buttons.

On this mouse it's just so far forward beyond where my thumbs can easily reach that it might as well not be there. I tried holding the mouse kinda sideways but that was just a joke.Well I suppose this mouse is good for people with big hands or people who aren't gonna use the sniper button, but for those with normal hands who are gonna use the sniper, it's crap.

",0.94228911440,pc,"Pros:__________• The tablet design is almost an uncanny resemblance to the IPad Pro. Pencil thin, smooth corners, and overall minimalistic design. This is a premium feel all around.• The screen is beautiful in every way. I want to highlight that the blacks are excellent and color context matches the brightness level you apply for the screen. For this to be an HDR10+ certification in viewing, I have nothing bad to see on this.• Watching YouTube videos at 1444p make this tablet one of the best in viewings. No more generic 1080p.• The bezels fit well with this tablet. Because of how light it is, I can use one hand to hold it without any issues, and I have enough room so I don’t touch the screen. One of few times that a bezel design comes in handy.• Don’t worry, the bezel layout is small enough to create an immersive experience, especially at night.• The aluminum back reduces the fingerprints for just the screen and provides a little more protection if you drop it. I never loved the glass back and Samsung has listened.• The S-Pen also has a minimalist design that fits right in the back of the tablet. Nothing on look and feel doesn’t create the impression of being cheap.• Got to love the USB-C port. Fast charging, importing, exporting files, and cheap to get extra chargers for the S6.• The S-Pen Air Action gestures are more useful than Samsung’s previous products. Because of the size of the screen, I found even swiping left to right and switching cameras an easy perk when using the Air Actions.  I can see anyone who wants to make PowerPoint presentations with the S6 a great selling point, as the S-Pen does a decent job with the simple Air Actions.• Very comfortable to write with the S-Pen (more details later on). Smooth and the right amount of pressure.• A battery notification immediately pops up on the right side of the screen every time I put the S-Pen back in its location (which has some magnets). I didn’t realize who useful this is since the notification lets me know if didn’t place the S-Pen in the correct location.• I got around 90 minutes for a full charge of the S-Pen, but you really shouldn’t worry as it will always charge on the S6.• I’m happy that you can attach the S-Pen on the side of the screen when you’re not using it, just like the IPad does for their pen.• Multi-tasking is spot-on. Samsung offers a lot of little software perks that makes multi-tasking not only easy, but I felt use this feature on a daily basis.• With the one button on the S-Pen has, you can customize to what you want to open with it.• I’m never a fan with tablet cameras, due to most phones have better equipment, but I got to hand it to Samsung on the built-in ultra-wide lens mode. An insane 123 degree made taking a picture with anything, show the whole world around it. For a quick family photo, it’s perfect. But then again your phone should be your main camera.• The gaming on this is very pleasant. I advise that when playing any high power game you switch the Samsung’s new feature called Game Booster. This feature will kill any apps that are taking away power from the tablet, so you can have more hours of gaming.  I didn’t test the comparison of how much a difference, but when playing any game on a tablet you want as much power as you can.• Playing Fortnite gave me 30fps and no lag what so ever.• One awesome feature Samsung has is the Transparency option. It’s basically a white page over your screen, which is transparent, so you can write on it while reading or watching a video.  I found this feature an excellent perk for taking notes or reading anything on the web. Everyone will find this very useful to have.• Dex Launch is pretty on point of what a windows desktop looks like. It takes around 5 seconds to load up, but when done, it looks like you’re staring into a Windows OS. Overall the layout works fine as one cool benefit I found is any app you click in DeX mode will pop up as a small window, rather than taking over the screen as a whole (no lag when I was watching Netflix in Dex mode). Also moving back and forth from android to Dex is a quick experience.• Battery life I’m getting around 13-14 hours. That’s around 70% brightness, mostly web and movie watching.  The killer in this is the gaming and the pen, if you’re using it a lot.• As you may already know, with this price, you know it’s fast. Opening up 10 apps, numerous web browsers, and an active gaming, the S6 took it in quite well.  For the average day speed will not be a problem.• Cheaper than an IPad Pro, and you get a Pen.• If you have ever used a Samsung device, you’ll feel right at home.Cons and Oks:__________• The fingerprint scanner is an optical sensor. It’s embedded in the screen but, not being an ultrasonic scanner, it can be fooled. With the technology of ultrasonic scanner already established, why install this? But it’s still responsive so it depends on your security requirements (You can just make a passcode if you’re still unsure).• Not headphone jack. A big turn off for those who see this for video editing on the go, or really anyone.• I’m not a fan of having the S-Pen in the back of the tablet.  Not only does it increase the chances of getting scratched when placing it back there, but the magnets on the back are not strong enough to make sure that the S-Pen stays on. You place the tablet on the ground, the S-Pen is the only form of contact with the surface are you place it on.• It’s a hassle to find the right location on placing the S-Pen correctly.  The back has a dip in the section where the pen goes but if you don’t put it in the correct way the S-Pen will fall off.  I have to make sure that it’s attached correctly because it’s impossible to identify, by touch, in which way to put the pen. There is a notification on screen to tell you when it’s connected, but why could’ve they create the charging station on the side so we not only put it in the right place, but we can see it all the time.• What I love about Samsung Galaxy Phones is the ability of how they hid their S-Pens, but this one is not hidden at all. To me, it feels similar to carrying the headphone jack adaptor. I’m not going to use all the time, but I still need to carry it because I may use it at random times.• The way Samsung design this, if you lose the S-Pen you feel like you lost a part of the tablet. With the open face S-Pen placement design in the back, if you lose the pen then it just likes a tablet with a dent in the back.• The Air Action gestures are only good for PowerPoint presentations and taking pictures. I couldn’t see the benefit of using this feature other than that.• As a personal video editor, this isn’t the best around. The S6 struggles to import 4k videos and it took numerous hours to encode an 8-minute video. Keep in mind that I had a decent amount of layers, but it’s still something to know if you wanted to know how fast exporting with Adobe is. Also note that editing in the program, while using the S-Pen, is excellent.• A major issue when drawing with this is the S-Pen’s shortcut button on it. I used the app Medibang Paint, and when drawing I’ll always press the shortcut button on the S-Pen by mistake. The way the button is designed, it’s right where your hand grip is when you write. Numerous times I was would be drawing and hand would press the S-Pen button.  This would immediately bring me to the shortcut page. I don’t know if this is an app issue, but this button problem needs to be fixed.• There is still a gap when you move with the S-Pen. It’s not much, but it’s there. I still had no issues to write notes with, but for those who want to draw it’s a heads up.• It does have face unlock, but it’s a 2D-based facial recognition. I’ll trust the fingerprint scanner first.• The camera is decent but even the ultra-wide format I saw it in a lower resolution. Stick to your phone. Video calls are fine, but other than that, forget it.• Again, the way Samsung design the tablet, because of the built-in S-Pen charging design, you’re somewhat forced to folk over $179 for “there” book cover. Because of the S-Pen, you have no choice if you don’t want the S-Pen to get scratch, or lost.• The speakers are decent, you get four of them.  I found the sound is very clear and loud.• Bixby voice command is the same throughout Samsung’s devices. The microphone the S6 has I didn’t get any issues of feedback.•  It’s very thin, but will bend if semi-force is applied.Bottom Line:__________Samsung for the past year has up its game in phones and tablets. Having posted reviews of their phones and tablets I can say that the S6 is another one in the books, but does have noticeable drawbacks.To summarize, if you want an IPad Pro but can’t afford it, then this what you’ll buy. The S6 is very fast, doesn’t heat up in gaming or video editing, and it’s a definite win for those who need to take notes (work, college, etc.). It has a beautiful image resolution with the bonus of having there S-Pen. I know that the goal Samsung is after the same as Apple, a replacement for the common laptop, and the S6 is right on point. If you get the keyboard cover than you have a pretty good package of the tablet, a pen, and a keyboard (with a trackpad!).But I think Samsung’s goal is also the problem.  They’re trying to make a laptop replacement with a tablet that lacks the internal hardware to support it. For web and basic programs, this is sure a good find, but other than that you start getting issues. On the design side, I’m not a fan of the S-Pen layout. You’re not going to use the S-Pen every time, but the way the S-Pen is placed, you’ll have to make sure that its place correctly. This could’ve been fixed if they added more magnets in the S-Pen holder.In the end, it’s a lower IPad Pro replacement. Still very fast and effective, but graphic power still goes to the IPad Pro as well as the Apple Pen.  With Samsung’s Android OS on their phones, in this tablet, and the upcoming watch, Samsung wants to be your only tech user.Overall: A great tablet for the day to day drawers and note-takers, but still not a laptop replacement.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer
",0.540,pc,"I received the Samsung Tab S6 the day it was released, which was nice. It has a beautiful display. As a photographer, my pictures look really good. So far I've discovered a couple of downsides that would make me consider returning it. I purchased a 512 gb microsd card for it and that works super. The Samsung SmartSwitch software allowed me to transfer my current Note 8's information to the S6 in about 40 minutes. I had a ton of data on the Note 8 with a 128 gb microsd card and the wireless transfer was much faster than expected. It transferred all of my installed apps along with the data. I didn't realize it but my wake up alarm this morning came from both my phone and tablet! LOLThe magnetic stylus which is clipped to the back will fall off a lot of the time, especially if you put it down. The stylus is attached via a small grove and is connected via a magnet. I've already lost it several times and had to spend a lot of time searching for it. I have the keyboard cover on order which is supposed to arrive next week. That has a cover which I think will cover up the stylus and keep it in place. I would NOT recommend buying the unit unless you buy the cover which is another $170 or $90 if you buy soon.The next problem is the unit is too big to hold with one hand and is slippery. It will slide out of your grip easily and there goes $800 to the floor. Depending on what you're doing the thin bezels mean that you have to put your thumb on the display to hold it with one hand and I found that I kept accidentally selecting a link on the side of the display. Plan on using it with both hands without a cover to hold onto. Hopefully the cover will make it easier to handle.All of the videos hyping the unit seem to always show the tablet on a stand or with the keyboard cover attached. I've yet to see one review with someone trying to hold the tablet by itself. The tablet is so wide that it's a stretch for me to hold the opposite edge so my other hand is free to do other things. After a few minutes, my hand gets cramped from reaching across the tablet and hold it. If you put a thumb on the display to hold it with one hand, if there is a clickable area under your thumb, you will accidentally do something unexpected.In retrospect, I would not buy this tablet. It costs almost as much as my MacBook Air which is a real computer but I'm a sucker for new shiny things.  May revisit this review after a little time but I spent almost $900 after tax on the top of the line unit and it is not as neat as I hoped. It is unbelievably light!Update 9/9/19 - After a couple of days of usage, my comments are still pretty much the same. By itself, the tablet is difficult to use one handed due to its size and tiny bezels. Plus, I've discovered that the screen lock will often lock up the unit and not allow you to unlock the screen. Swiping up the display does nothing and it doesn't recognize my fingerprint, or face. When this happens, it's taken a lot of trial and error to get it unlocked. It's like the unit sees the request to unlock but doesn't do anything. This only seems to happen when the tablet has been asleep for a while, such as overnight.On a positive note, battery life seems really good. If you put the unit down overnight it will only lose a percent or two of battery after sleeping overnight.The Samsung Tab S6 is FAST! I have a Nexus 7 and another 7 inch tablet and this one runs rings around them. Looking at photos which are 1-2 mb in file size, you can instantly flip between pictures. If I could hold it, I think I'd love it and Amazon has just updated the ship schedule for the Keyboard cover to arrive in three days. I can't wait.
",0.18428483640,pc,"Updated review after 2nd keyboard cover delivered.I have removed 2 stars. I purchased this device as a work device. However, the $180 keyboard stand designed for the tablet does NOT stay on reliably. The design is not good, and at angles, air is allowed to leak into the back suction cup and the tablet slaps onto the table. It happens every time I have it in my lap, and often when just on a desk.Because this is touted as a ""laptop replacement"", and the thing that makes it a laptop is unusable, I cannot recommend it. Wait until next year.Updated review after one week:I've received the keyboard cover, and while I love it, I am skeptical about the adhesive on the back. Last night I could not get it to stay on, so I cleaned the adhesive and left it stuck overnight, and now it seems better. I have a replacement coming from amazon, because I have very little faith in this one.Apart from that, the keyboard is amazing. it feels great to type on, and the shortucts are very useful. I am not a fan of the tiny backspace key, but overall it is a reasonable compromise. The addition of the trackpad turns it from a ""dockable PC replacement"" to a true laptop replacement.My favorite samsung S-Pen enabled tablet up until this point was the Note 12.2. Even though I liked the tab S4, there were several annoying factors. If you want to use DeX, you really need the device propped upright, and you need either a better face scanner or a fingerprint sensor. Trust me, you'd understand if you tried it on the S4.With the S4, I immediately had speaker envy vs my wife's iPad pro. The sound wasn't even comparable. Given that this is a significant media consumption device, having excellent speakers is a must. The tab S6 speakers sound nearly as good as the iPad pro. They are excellent, and you won't be disappointed.The in-display fingerprint sensor is really great. I have had no problem with lag or unrecognized fingers. Not much more to say, except that it greatly improves the DeX experience and the overall usability. No more looking at the camera at the top of the device, or even worse, when the device is in landscape, trying to figure out where to put your eyes so the camera can see it.Face ID on the iPad pro is so good that you don't have to go through those hoops... but samsung took the easy way out and put in the optical reader under the screen, and I'm really glad they did. I like it better.The S-Pen feels better. I get far fewer unintentional clicks of the button than the bigger round one on the S4. The concept of where they put the pen actually makes sense. Take an iPad with the Pencil... if you want a case, you have to either have one side of the iPad naked, or have some weird extension. The extension makes sense, so you don't lose the Pencil. BUT, if it's on the back, you still have the slim tablet profile, and you don't need a wider case to hold.I had a generic TPU case until I got my official cover in, and just having a case on it makes putting the pencil away MUCH easier.I ALWAYS recommend official samsung cases, as they fit best and feel professional. They are expensive, but worth it.I'm super disappointed that there is no flash on the camera. It really makes a big difference if you scan documents with your tablet. The Note (read: S-pen enabled devices) lineup has always been about productivity, and that means marking up PDFs and photos. Even in Okay lighting, scanning documents requires more light, and a flash should  just be common sense.As for the rest: I got the 6gb 128gb version. My tab S4 had no problem with a million windows, and it had 4gb of ram. This one is quite fast, and handles all of the apps just fine, never any lag with microsoft office and the internet and Adobe running. If you want to photoshop, I always recommend the highest specs possible though.The tablet is thin and light and impressive to hold. The screen is samsung amazing. One UI version 2.0 feels great to use.-Bluetooth 5.0 is nice.- I'd like the bezels to be smaller and the screen to be bigger. I'd gladly buy a 12 inch Tab S6.- Having the SMS messages synced to the tablet makes me so happy. (verizon customers, you are out of luck)- I with there were games optimized for a keyboard in DeX. I'd waste some time on that.- I love the way the case feels
",0.8215653940,pc,"After having bought this tablet and used it for a couple of days, that was what I was asking myself, “who is this for, exactly?” Let’s just say Samsung isn’t reigniting the tablet wars anytime soon with the Tab S6, that War was won, long ago, by Apple. But I really missed the Android eco system, I hadn’t owned a non-Apple tablet in years, the Tab S2, to be exact. I did purchase Google’s Pixel Slate, briefly, in a previous attempt to return to the green guy, but found it to be too unwieldy, buggy, and just plain expensive to justify keeping it.That all being said, I thought the Tab S6 was a bit on the pricy side, but not nearly so much as the Pixel Slate, even with the keyboard, and as Samsung is the biggest Android show in town, it’d be a good place to start again with the OS.I was wrong. I feel like, ultimately, Android doesn’t work on tablets. It’s, as I said before, too unwieldy. Use an Android tablet a day, then use an iPad the following day, you cannot tell me the iPad experience isn’t just more fluid, more usable, just better. But the OS itself wasn’t enough for me to give up on the Tab S6, it also promised great sound, DEX, a desktop environment with the Tab S6, when you add an “optional” $170 keyboard, and a great screen.The Tab S6 delivers on two of these promises, but the 3rd is so poorly done that it ended my experience with this tablet.The sound, is quite good, especially for the size and form factor of the tablet.The screen is very nice. Usual overblown saturated Samsung AMOLED screens, but it looks good and blacks are true.Dex? Horrible. First of all, I remind you that on a tablet that is definitely advertised as a laptop replacement, does not include said tablet. Would these tablet manufacturers PLEASE STOP advertising a product as a tablet replacement and then not include the keyboard? When I add the 170 to the standard 650-750 price for the tablet, and now my “laptop replacement” is pushing well over 900 bucks...might as well get a laptop, right? The CPU / RAM will easily exceed what’s in the S6. And if you want a tablet only device, the newest non-pro iPad has a beautiful screen, great speakers too, and costs about 1/2 as much as the S6.Back to Dex, the reason why it is terrible is that A) you must attach the “optional” keyboard to even use it. B) most, and I mean most, of your Android apps will be nonfunctional in Dex mode, so what’s even the point of it? I don’t need a desktop environment to surf the web, which is all you’ll be doing in Dex mode anyway. It’s just a stupid desktop-like experience to try to justify making you spend 170 just to get into it.So, if you want a pure Android tablet, there are 1000 varieties, much cheaper. Heck, a Amazon Fire tablet is so much cheaper and will give you your basic android experience, buy it instead. If you want a great tablet, buy the cheapest new regular iPad. If you want a tablet that can truly replace a laptop, get an iPad Pro with a brydge keyboard, they are fantastic. But if you truly want an Android/tablet hybrid? Chrome book!! I replaced this with a Pixel book, so much better keyboard, it’s backlit (Tab S6 keyboard is not backlit, for 170? whatever), it still has a good touchscreen, and the Android integration actually works...usually.
",0.89995825340,pc,"I had an Apple iPad Air 2 for four years,  used it 3+ hours a day for news reading and other stuff during that period everyday. It worked great but recently the battery went down quicker than I'd like and processing became a bit sluggish on certain websites and apps.  Understandable given its age.  I selected this S6 over a new iPad pro because of its slightly smaller size and weight,  and slightly higher performance. I've always used Galaxy phones, so Android and iOS both are familiar to me.THE GOOD- Fast.  Nothing surprising given the enhancement in predecessor and RAM.- Swype. Typing on the iPad sucked. It's so much easier on the Tab with Swype.- Transitioning preferences and apps from my galaxy phone worked quite well,  saved time from downloading all of the apps individually (over 100). Took over pw's too.THE BAD- The pen on the back thing is stupid.  The guy who invented this and managed who approved should be fired. This is as dumb as those ridiculous galaxy fold issues.- The fingerprint sensor takes 2+ tries to get in.- Browsers.  I guess I got used to Safari, but I'm spending a lot of time trying to figure out which browser i should use as my primary,  and all have issues... Firefox,  Samsung, Edge, Chrome.- Same with the Samsung Note app. It sucks, big time. Why would you add a pen without a sophisticated note app. Again, heads at Samsung should roll for this incompetence.In summary, this tab is what I'd expect after a four year upgrade from an iPad Air 2, but nothing more,  and nothing terribly innovative.
",0.14382559140,pc,"Nice concept and I believe it's Samsung's best tablet yet. However, for $650-$700 (including taxes and accessories) it has too many short comings that leaves much to be desired. It blows my mind that THEY thought it would be a good idea to add a magnetic stylus to the BACK of the device vice somewhere on the sides (top, bottom, left/right). The ""magnetic force"" isn't all that strong so a case for protection is strongly recommended. That isn't the worst of it! The stylus can be laid on either side to attach BUT it has to be on the CORRECT side for charging. SMH. That is so ANNOYING!!! I'm not a fan of Apple but I can appreciate them perfecting this issue BEFORE IT BECAME AN ISSUE!!! And I will never understand for the life of me why they used old in screen fingerprint reader technology on a ""just hit the market"" device that costs $650-$700!!! It has been years since I've purchased any more Samsung tablets so I was excited to get this one but only to be regretfully disappointed. With that being said, this tablet has been returned and I await their next one with my fingers crossed.
",0.13719165340,pc,"I was really looking forward to my new Samsung Galaxy Tab S6. Please look over the item description... the offer has four months YouTube Premium at no charge included with purchase. I've called Amazon twice (each over 30 minutes - thanks Esther D. for making the phone call long while you cut-n-pasted the unhelpful email - I waxed my car hood while you composed the email, that is the moment the return decision was made) and I've called Samsung.... nobody can help with this simple request. I'm sending it back to Amazon to purchase elsewhere... maybe...poor service from both Amazon and Samsung is making the IPad Pro look attractive.For the tablet - I purchased to use with Lightroom and light office work while visiting friends and family. For the week it has been put to use; Lightroom CC mobile (subscription version) the Tab S6 is quick and the screen beautiful! The stylus makes quick and easy edits! Love it! My light office work is emails, MS Word Docs, PP, and Excel - the Tab S6 handles with eaze.Ths battery life  suits my day away from home- downloading images in the field via cable connection with editing taking about two-three hours. Uploading when I get home.I'm returning because Amazon can not live up to their end of the deal. They had the chance when on the phone with customer service for way too long.
",0.79902410540,pc," When I first received it I was blown away by how well it could handle the multitask. Watching videos and playing games with this this tab is just amazing! Taking down notes and drawing too! But, everything started to go downhill from here as I noticed the digitizer faulty. The screen started ""ghost tapping"" and I had to return the product for a lost. Still, good product tho but I received a faulty one. But I'm giving it 1 star for my experience.
",0.24814575940,pc,"I bought this for upcoming travel.  I wanted to replace my laptop with something lighter.  It had potential but there were two huge problems. #1 is the included stylus kept falling off.  For travel, the stylus would be lost in a day or two.  If you get this, you will NEED a case or cover that helps hold the stylus.  The second and larger issue is the secrren has horrible touch sensativity.  it literally would not detect my finger touching it unless I licked the tip of my finger to make it wet and that only lasted for a few swipes.  This made it totally unusable as I'd use my finger 99% of the time.  I tried for a few hours and finally gave up in frustration.  I ran updates, but no improvement.I later purchased a Samsung Note S5e from Amazon and it is a huge improvement in sensativity.  I'd give the S6 a 1/10 for the touch screen.  I'd give the S5e a 8/10 on the touchscreen.  Touch sensativity was not as nice as my cell phone, but perfectly acceptable.  I also noticed the S6 and the S5e had very comparable and fast performance with day to day application usage even though the S6 has a more powerful CPU.The thing I liked the most about the S6 (and S5e also) was the beautiful screen display.

The rubber on the outside is also soft and bouncy, helps protect the baby pad when you drop it by accident,  or in my kids case,  when they throw it. The camera could be a little bit better,  but honestly who buys a touch screen pad for kids and expect a super camera?

Great decision, he not only does bug me for my phone which I have to constantly check to make sure he hasn't clicked on video that are bad (he's 5) but the tablet is geared toward child development. He has already learned to say new words and say his abcs, which he has a learning disability so before you judge, thinking he's 4, he should know that, not all kids are the same. 5 stars is an understatement for my family.

",0.97103822242,pc,"Pros:__________• The tablet design is almost an uncanny resemblance to the IPad Pro. Pencil thin, smooth corners, and overall minimalistic design. This is a premium feel all around.• The screen is beautiful in every way. I want to highlight that the blacks are excellent and color context matches the brightness level you apply for the screen. For this to be an HDR10+ certification in viewing, I have nothing bad to see on this.• Watching YouTube videos at 1444p make this tablet one of the best in viewings. No more generic 1080p.• The bezels fit well with this tablet. Because of how light it is, I can use one hand to hold it without any issues, and I have enough room so I don’t touch the screen. One of few times that a bezel design comes in handy.• Don’t worry, the bezel layout is small enough to create an immersive experience, especially at night.• The aluminum back reduces the fingerprints for just the screen and provides a little more protection if you drop it. I never loved the glass back and Samsung has listened.• The S-Pen also has a minimalist design that fits right in the back of the tablet. Nothing on look and feel doesn’t create the impression of being cheap.• Got to love the USB-C port. Fast charging, importing, exporting files, and cheap to get extra chargers for the S6.• The S-Pen Air Action gestures are more useful than Samsung’s previous products. Because of the size of the screen, I found even swiping left to right and switching cameras an easy perk when using the Air Actions.  I can see anyone who wants to make PowerPoint presentations with the S6 a great selling point, as the S-Pen does a decent job with the simple Air Actions.• Very comfortable to write with the S-Pen (more details later on). Smooth and the right amount of pressure.• A battery notification immediately pops up on the right side of the screen every time I put the S-Pen back in its location (which has some magnets). I didn’t realize who useful this is since the notification lets me know if didn’t place the S-Pen in the correct location.• I got around 90 minutes for a full charge of the S-Pen, but you really shouldn’t worry as it will always charge on the S6.• I’m happy that you can attach the S-Pen on the side of the screen when you’re not using it, just like the IPad does for their pen.• Multi-tasking is spot-on. Samsung offers a lot of little software perks that makes multi-tasking not only easy, but I felt use this feature on a daily basis.• With the one button on the S-Pen has, you can customize to what you want to open with it.• I’m never a fan with tablet cameras, due to most phones have better equipment, but I got to hand it to Samsung on the built-in ultra-wide lens mode. An insane 123 degree made taking a picture with anything, show the whole world around it. For a quick family photo, it’s perfect. But then again your phone should be your main camera.• The gaming on this is very pleasant. I advise that when playing any high power game you switch the Samsung’s new feature called Game Booster. This feature will kill any apps that are taking away power from the tablet, so you can have more hours of gaming.  I didn’t test the comparison of how much a difference, but when playing any game on a tablet you want as much power as you can.• Playing Fortnite gave me 30fps and no lag what so ever.• One awesome feature Samsung has is the Transparency option. It’s basically a white page over your screen, which is transparent, so you can write on it while reading or watching a video.  I found this feature an excellent perk for taking notes or reading anything on the web. Everyone will find this very useful to have.• Dex Launch is pretty on point of what a windows desktop looks like. It takes around 5 seconds to load up, but when done, it looks like you’re staring into a Windows OS. Overall the layout works fine as one cool benefit I found is any app you click in DeX mode will pop up as a small window, rather than taking over the screen as a whole (no lag when I was watching Netflix in Dex mode). Also moving back and forth from android to Dex is a quick experience.• Battery life I’m getting around 13-14 hours. That’s around 70% brightness, mostly web and movie watching.  The killer in this is the gaming and the pen, if you’re using it a lot.• As you may already know, with this price, you know it’s fast. Opening up 10 apps, numerous web browsers, and an active gaming, the S6 took it in quite well.  For the average day speed will not be a problem.• Cheaper than an IPad Pro, and you get a Pen.• If you have ever used a Samsung device, you’ll feel right at home.Cons and Oks:__________• The fingerprint scanner is an optical sensor. It’s embedded in the screen but, not being an ultrasonic scanner, it can be fooled. With the technology of ultrasonic scanner already established, why install this? But it’s still responsive so it depends on your security requirements (You can just make a passcode if you’re still unsure).• Not headphone jack. A big turn off for those who see this for video editing on the go, or really anyone.• I’m not a fan of having the S-Pen in the back of the tablet.  Not only does it increase the chances of getting scratched when placing it back there, but the magnets on the back are not strong enough to make sure that the S-Pen stays on. You place the tablet on the ground, the S-Pen is the only form of contact with the surface are you place it on.• It’s a hassle to find the right location on placing the S-Pen correctly.  The back has a dip in the section where the pen goes but if you don’t put it in the correct way the S-Pen will fall off.  I have to make sure that it’s attached correctly because it’s impossible to identify, by touch, in which way to put the pen. There is a notification on screen to tell you when it’s connected, but why could’ve they create the charging station on the side so we not only put it in the right place, but we can see it all the time.• What I love about Samsung Galaxy Phones is the ability of how they hid their S-Pens, but this one is not hidden at all. To me, it feels similar to carrying the headphone jack adaptor. I’m not going to use all the time, but I still need to carry it because I may use it at random times.• The way Samsung design this, if you lose the S-Pen you feel like you lost a part of the tablet. With the open face S-Pen placement design in the back, if you lose the pen then it just likes a tablet with a dent in the back.• The Air Action gestures are only good for PowerPoint presentations and taking pictures. I couldn’t see the benefit of using this feature other than that.• As a personal video editor, this isn’t the best around. The S6 struggles to import 4k videos and it took numerous hours to encode an 8-minute video. Keep in mind that I had a decent amount of layers, but it’s still something to know if you wanted to know how fast exporting with Adobe is. Also note that editing in the program, while using the S-Pen, is excellent.• A major issue when drawing with this is the S-Pen’s shortcut button on it. I used the app Medibang Paint, and when drawing I’ll always press the shortcut button on the S-Pen by mistake. The way the button is designed, it’s right where your hand grip is when you write. Numerous times I was would be drawing and hand would press the S-Pen button.  This would immediately bring me to the shortcut page. I don’t know if this is an app issue, but this button problem needs to be fixed.• There is still a gap when you move with the S-Pen. It’s not much, but it’s there. I still had no issues to write notes with, but for those who want to draw it’s a heads up.• It does have face unlock, but it’s a 2D-based facial recognition. I’ll trust the fingerprint scanner first.• The camera is decent but even the ultra-wide format I saw it in a lower resolution. Stick to your phone. Video calls are fine, but other than that, forget it.• Again, the way Samsung design the tablet, because of the built-in S-Pen charging design, you’re somewhat forced to folk over $179 for “there” book cover. Because of the S-Pen, you have no choice if you don’t want the S-Pen to get scratch, or lost.• The speakers are decent, you get four of them.  I found the sound is very clear and loud.• Bixby voice command is the same throughout Samsung’s devices. The microphone the S6 has I didn’t get any issues of feedback.•  It’s very thin, but will bend if semi-force is applied.Bottom Line:__________Samsung for the past year has up its game in phones and tablets. Having posted reviews of their phones and tablets I can say that the S6 is another one in the books, but does have noticeable drawbacks.To summarize, if you want an IPad Pro but can’t afford it, then this what you’ll buy. The S6 is very fast, doesn’t heat up in gaming or video editing, and it’s a definite win for those who need to take notes (work, college, etc.). It has a beautiful image resolution with the bonus of having there S-Pen. I know that the goal Samsung is after the same as Apple, a replacement for the common laptop, and the S6 is right on point. If you get the keyboard cover than you have a pretty good package of the tablet, a pen, and a keyboard (with a trackpad!).But I think Samsung’s goal is also the problem.  They’re trying to make a laptop replacement with a tablet that lacks the internal hardware to support it. For web and basic programs, this is sure a good find, but other than that you start getting issues. On the design side, I’m not a fan of the S-Pen layout. You’re not going to use the S-Pen every time, but the way the S-Pen is placed, you’ll have to make sure that its place correctly. This could’ve been fixed if they added more magnets in the S-Pen holder.In the end, it’s a lower IPad Pro replacement. Still very fast and effective, but graphic power still goes to the IPad Pro as well as the Apple Pen.  With Samsung’s Android OS on their phones, in this tablet, and the upcoming watch, Samsung wants to be your only tech user.Overall: A great tablet for the day to day drawers and note-takers, but still not a laptop replacement.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer
",0.542,pc,"I received the Samsung Tab S6 the day it was released, which was nice. It has a beautiful display. As a photographer, my pictures look really good. So far I've discovered a couple of downsides that would make me consider returning it. I purchased a 512 gb microsd card for it and that works super. The Samsung SmartSwitch software allowed me to transfer my current Note 8's information to the S6 in about 40 minutes. I had a ton of data on the Note 8 with a 128 gb microsd card and the wireless transfer was much faster than expected. It transferred all of my installed apps along with the data. I didn't realize it but my wake up alarm this morning came from both my phone and tablet! LOLThe magnetic stylus which is clipped to the back will fall off a lot of the time, especially if you put it down. The stylus is attached via a small grove and is connected via a magnet. I've already lost it several times and had to spend a lot of time searching for it. I have the keyboard cover on order which is supposed to arrive next week. That has a cover which I think will cover up the stylus and keep it in place. I would NOT recommend buying the unit unless you buy the cover which is another $170 or $90 if you buy soon.The next problem is the unit is too big to hold with one hand and is slippery. It will slide out of your grip easily and there goes $800 to the floor. Depending on what you're doing the thin bezels mean that you have to put your thumb on the display to hold it with one hand and I found that I kept accidentally selecting a link on the side of the display. Plan on using it with both hands without a cover to hold onto. Hopefully the cover will make it easier to handle.All of the videos hyping the unit seem to always show the tablet on a stand or with the keyboard cover attached. I've yet to see one review with someone trying to hold the tablet by itself. The tablet is so wide that it's a stretch for me to hold the opposite edge so my other hand is free to do other things. After a few minutes, my hand gets cramped from reaching across the tablet and hold it. If you put a thumb on the display to hold it with one hand, if there is a clickable area under your thumb, you will accidentally do something unexpected.In retrospect, I would not buy this tablet. It costs almost as much as my MacBook Air which is a real computer but I'm a sucker for new shiny things.  May revisit this review after a little time but I spent almost $900 after tax on the top of the line unit and it is not as neat as I hoped. It is unbelievably light!Update 9/9/19 - After a couple of days of usage, my comments are still pretty much the same. By itself, the tablet is difficult to use one handed due to its size and tiny bezels. Plus, I've discovered that the screen lock will often lock up the unit and not allow you to unlock the screen. Swiping up the display does nothing and it doesn't recognize my fingerprint, or face. When this happens, it's taken a lot of trial and error to get it unlocked. It's like the unit sees the request to unlock but doesn't do anything. This only seems to happen when the tablet has been asleep for a while, such as overnight.On a positive note, battery life seems really good. If you put the unit down overnight it will only lose a percent or two of battery after sleeping overnight.The Samsung Tab S6 is FAST! I have a Nexus 7 and another 7 inch tablet and this one runs rings around them. Looking at photos which are 1-2 mb in file size, you can instantly flip between pictures. If I could hold it, I think I'd love it and Amazon has just updated the ship schedule for the Keyboard cover to arrive in three days. I can't wait.
",0.18428483642,pc,"Updated review after 2nd keyboard cover delivered.I have removed 2 stars. I purchased this device as a work device. However, the $180 keyboard stand designed for the tablet does NOT stay on reliably. The design is not good, and at angles, air is allowed to leak into the back suction cup and the tablet slaps onto the table. It happens every time I have it in my lap, and often when just on a desk.Because this is touted as a ""laptop replacement"", and the thing that makes it a laptop is unusable, I cannot recommend it. Wait until next year.Updated review after one week:I've received the keyboard cover, and while I love it, I am skeptical about the adhesive on the back. Last night I could not get it to stay on, so I cleaned the adhesive and left it stuck overnight, and now it seems better. I have a replacement coming from amazon, because I have very little faith in this one.Apart from that, the keyboard is amazing. it feels great to type on, and the shortucts are very useful. I am not a fan of the tiny backspace key, but overall it is a reasonable compromise. The addition of the trackpad turns it from a ""dockable PC replacement"" to a true laptop replacement.My favorite samsung S-Pen enabled tablet up until this point was the Note 12.2. Even though I liked the tab S4, there were several annoying factors. If you want to use DeX, you really need the device propped upright, and you need either a better face scanner or a fingerprint sensor. Trust me, you'd understand if you tried it on the S4.With the S4, I immediately had speaker envy vs my wife's iPad pro. The sound wasn't even comparable. Given that this is a significant media consumption device, having excellent speakers is a must. The tab S6 speakers sound nearly as good as the iPad pro. They are excellent, and you won't be disappointed.The in-display fingerprint sensor is really great. I have had no problem with lag or unrecognized fingers. Not much more to say, except that it greatly improves the DeX experience and the overall usability. No more looking at the camera at the top of the device, or even worse, when the device is in landscape, trying to figure out where to put your eyes so the camera can see it.Face ID on the iPad pro is so good that you don't have to go through those hoops... but samsung took the easy way out and put in the optical reader under the screen, and I'm really glad they did. I like it better.The S-Pen feels better. I get far fewer unintentional clicks of the button than the bigger round one on the S4. The concept of where they put the pen actually makes sense. Take an iPad with the Pencil... if you want a case, you have to either have one side of the iPad naked, or have some weird extension. The extension makes sense, so you don't lose the Pencil. BUT, if it's on the back, you still have the slim tablet profile, and you don't need a wider case to hold.I had a generic TPU case until I got my official cover in, and just having a case on it makes putting the pencil away MUCH easier.I ALWAYS recommend official samsung cases, as they fit best and feel professional. They are expensive, but worth it.I'm super disappointed that there is no flash on the camera. It really makes a big difference if you scan documents with your tablet. The Note (read: S-pen enabled devices) lineup has always been about productivity, and that means marking up PDFs and photos. Even in Okay lighting, scanning documents requires more light, and a flash should  just be common sense.As for the rest: I got the 6gb 128gb version. My tab S4 had no problem with a million windows, and it had 4gb of ram. This one is quite fast, and handles all of the apps just fine, never any lag with microsoft office and the internet and Adobe running. If you want to photoshop, I always recommend the highest specs possible though.The tablet is thin and light and impressive to hold. The screen is samsung amazing. One UI version 2.0 feels great to use.-Bluetooth 5.0 is nice.- I'd like the bezels to be smaller and the screen to be bigger. I'd gladly buy a 12 inch Tab S6.- Having the SMS messages synced to the tablet makes me so happy. (verizon customers, you are out of luck)- I with there were games optimized for a keyboard in DeX. I'd waste some time on that.- I love the way the case feels
",0.8215653942,pc,"After having bought this tablet and used it for a couple of days, that was what I was asking myself, “who is this for, exactly?” Let’s just say Samsung isn’t reigniting the tablet wars anytime soon with the Tab S6, that War was won, long ago, by Apple. But I really missed the Android eco system, I hadn’t owned a non-Apple tablet in years, the Tab S2, to be exact. I did purchase Google’s Pixel Slate, briefly, in a previous attempt to return to the green guy, but found it to be too unwieldy, buggy, and just plain expensive to justify keeping it.That all being said, I thought the Tab S6 was a bit on the pricy side, but not nearly so much as the Pixel Slate, even with the keyboard, and as Samsung is the biggest Android show in town, it’d be a good place to start again with the OS.I was wrong. I feel like, ultimately, Android doesn’t work on tablets. It’s, as I said before, too unwieldy. Use an Android tablet a day, then use an iPad the following day, you cannot tell me the iPad experience isn’t just more fluid, more usable, just better. But the OS itself wasn’t enough for me to give up on the Tab S6, it also promised great sound, DEX, a desktop environment with the Tab S6, when you add an “optional” $170 keyboard, and a great screen.The Tab S6 delivers on two of these promises, but the 3rd is so poorly done that it ended my experience with this tablet.The sound, is quite good, especially for the size and form factor of the tablet.The screen is very nice. Usual overblown saturated Samsung AMOLED screens, but it looks good and blacks are true.Dex? Horrible. First of all, I remind you that on a tablet that is definitely advertised as a laptop replacement, does not include said tablet. Would these tablet manufacturers PLEASE STOP advertising a product as a tablet replacement and then not include the keyboard? When I add the 170 to the standard 650-750 price for the tablet, and now my “laptop replacement” is pushing well over 900 bucks...might as well get a laptop, right? The CPU / RAM will easily exceed what’s in the S6. And if you want a tablet only device, the newest non-pro iPad has a beautiful screen, great speakers too, and costs about 1/2 as much as the S6.Back to Dex, the reason why it is terrible is that A) you must attach the “optional” keyboard to even use it. B) most, and I mean most, of your Android apps will be nonfunctional in Dex mode, so what’s even the point of it? I don’t need a desktop environment to surf the web, which is all you’ll be doing in Dex mode anyway. It’s just a stupid desktop-like experience to try to justify making you spend 170 just to get into it.So, if you want a pure Android tablet, there are 1000 varieties, much cheaper. Heck, a Amazon Fire tablet is so much cheaper and will give you your basic android experience, buy it instead. If you want a great tablet, buy the cheapest new regular iPad. If you want a tablet that can truly replace a laptop, get an iPad Pro with a brydge keyboard, they are fantastic. But if you truly want an Android/tablet hybrid? Chrome book!! I replaced this with a Pixel book, so much better keyboard, it’s backlit (Tab S6 keyboard is not backlit, for 170? whatever), it still has a good touchscreen, and the Android integration actually works...usually.
",0.89995825342,pc,"I had an Apple iPad Air 2 for four years,  used it 3+ hours a day for news reading and other stuff during that period everyday. It worked great but recently the battery went down quicker than I'd like and processing became a bit sluggish on certain websites and apps.  Understandable given its age.  I selected this S6 over a new iPad pro because of its slightly smaller size and weight,  and slightly higher performance. I've always used Galaxy phones, so Android and iOS both are familiar to me.THE GOOD- Fast.  Nothing surprising given the enhancement in predecessor and RAM.- Swype. Typing on the iPad sucked. It's so much easier on the Tab with Swype.- Transitioning preferences and apps from my galaxy phone worked quite well,  saved time from downloading all of the apps individually (over 100). Took over pw's too.THE BAD- The pen on the back thing is stupid.  The guy who invented this and managed who approved should be fired. This is as dumb as those ridiculous galaxy fold issues.- The fingerprint sensor takes 2+ tries to get in.- Browsers.  I guess I got used to Safari, but I'm spending a lot of time trying to figure out which browser i should use as my primary,  and all have issues... Firefox,  Samsung, Edge, Chrome.- Same with the Samsung Note app. It sucks, big time. Why would you add a pen without a sophisticated note app. Again, heads at Samsung should roll for this incompetence.In summary, this tab is what I'd expect after a four year upgrade from an iPad Air 2, but nothing more,  and nothing terribly innovative.
",0.14382559142,pc,"Nice concept and I believe it's Samsung's best tablet yet. However, for $650-$700 (including taxes and accessories) it has too many short comings that leaves much to be desired. It blows my mind that THEY thought it would be a good idea to add a magnetic stylus to the BACK of the device vice somewhere on the sides (top, bottom, left/right). The ""magnetic force"" isn't all that strong so a case for protection is strongly recommended. That isn't the worst of it! The stylus can be laid on either side to attach BUT it has to be on the CORRECT side for charging. SMH. That is so ANNOYING!!! I'm not a fan of Apple but I can appreciate them perfecting this issue BEFORE IT BECAME AN ISSUE!!! And I will never understand for the life of me why they used old in screen fingerprint reader technology on a ""just hit the market"" device that costs $650-$700!!! It has been years since I've purchased any more Samsung tablets so I was excited to get this one but only to be regretfully disappointed. With that being said, this tablet has been returned and I await their next one with my fingers crossed.
",0.13719165342,pc,"I was really looking forward to my new Samsung Galaxy Tab S6. Please look over the item description... the offer has four months YouTube Premium at no charge included with purchase. I've called Amazon twice (each over 30 minutes - thanks Esther D. for making the phone call long while you cut-n-pasted the unhelpful email - I waxed my car hood while you composed the email, that is the moment the return decision was made) and I've called Samsung.... nobody can help with this simple request. I'm sending it back to Amazon to purchase elsewhere... maybe...poor service from both Amazon and Samsung is making the IPad Pro look attractive.For the tablet - I purchased to use with Lightroom and light office work while visiting friends and family. For the week it has been put to use; Lightroom CC mobile (subscription version) the Tab S6 is quick and the screen beautiful! The stylus makes quick and easy edits! Love it! My light office work is emails, MS Word Docs, PP, and Excel - the Tab S6 handles with eaze.Ths battery life  suits my day away from home- downloading images in the field via cable connection with editing taking about two-three hours. Uploading when I get home.I'm returning because Amazon can not live up to their end of the deal. They had the chance when on the phone with customer service for way too long.
",0.79902410542,pc," When I first received it I was blown away by how well it could handle the multitask. Watching videos and playing games with this this tab is just amazing! Taking down notes and drawing too! But, everything started to go downhill from here as I noticed the digitizer faulty. The screen started ""ghost tapping"" and I had to return the product for a lost. Still, good product tho but I received a faulty one. But I'm giving it 1 star for my experience.
",0.24814575942,pc,"I bought this for upcoming travel.  I wanted to replace my laptop with something lighter.  It had potential but there were two huge problems. #1 is the included stylus kept falling off.  For travel, the stylus would be lost in a day or two.  If you get this, you will NEED a case or cover that helps hold the stylus.  The second and larger issue is the secrren has horrible touch sensativity.  it literally would not detect my finger touching it unless I licked the tip of my finger to make it wet and that only lasted for a few swipes.  This made it totally unusable as I'd use my finger 99% of the time.  I tried for a few hours and finally gave up in frustration.  I ran updates, but no improvement.I later purchased a Samsung Note S5e from Amazon and it is a huge improvement in sensativity.  I'd give the S6 a 1/10 for the touch screen.  I'd give the S5e a 8/10 on the touchscreen.  Touch sensativity was not as nice as my cell phone, but perfectly acceptable.  I also noticed the S6 and the S5e had very comparable and fast performance with day to day application usage even though the S6 has a more powerful CPU.The thing I liked the most about the S6 (and S5e also) was the beautiful screen display.

Basically I daisy-chained the Ethernet out of the main router to the Ethernet in of the secondary router. Long story short, the secondary router still needed a direct internet connection to connect to my newly established home network. Once I configured the second router as a mesh point I unplugged it and moved it to the room I intended it to be in. Not sure if this will be required for everyone that try to use 2 routers but Google needs to update their documentation. At least the kid from Google support was pretty nice.

",0.14587491845,pc,"So a full 6 hours of setting this up is insane and google needs better support when they launch a product.  No instructions, and 2 hours on the phone with their tech support.  Issue was the 2 routers vs the standard extra point (which would have been a simple setup).My first router plugged into my Motorola MG7550 modem with no issues, I disabled the wifi on it so that wouldn't be an issue.  For some reason my speeds were not any better than the modems wifi though.  I was really disappointed since I spent $300 on this setup.  After resetting it a few times and trying to install the other point I started seeing the speed pickup (using third party app on phone).  All of a sudden I was getting 230mbps wifi which is the same as my hard wired speed!  I was getting 80mbps max on the motorola wifi.  My home server movie files were too big to ever stream with around 50mbps in my bedroom but now its no issue as I am also getting over 200 there.The problem was the second point, which I needed badly in my office across the house, never got a good wifi signal but I have a hard line into there, so it was just annoying for phone use.  Figured it would be simple, hook up the hard line (from a switch) to the second router, then since it has the extra port plug that into my computer to keep the hardline going.  Yeah no such luck, kept saying ""problem connecting to cloud"" on the final step of setup, so the wifi networks wouldn't sync (even though my phone was picking up the second one, it was under a different name) and it wouldn't connect my computer to the rest of the network.Took an hour of explaining to google support until they finally understood there is a 2 pack of routers that only amazon sells (they kept trying to tell me I had 1 router and a point).  Then they said it wouldn't work with 2 routers unless I wanted 2 wireless networks (which defeats the purpose of this).  It turns out the problem was my motorola modem/router still wanting to act as a router, I unplugged everything from it except for the 1 cable going into the nest wifi, then had the witch going out from the nest wifi and even though I turned off wifi on the actual modem I also went in and changed the setting to be a bridge (not sure if that did anything, but goolge help person mentioned it).  Then it picked up second router as new mesh point and connected but it was acting like a regular point and not a hard wired router, so the connection sucked.  The whole point of me buying this 2 pack instead of the $269 one directly from google was having the 2 hardwired routers for better coverage.  Well something finally clicked along the way not exactly sure what it was as we did so many things over the 2 hours on the phone, but its all working now.  I have 2 routers hooked up, both hardwired and both sending 100% full strength signal as wifi even though they are completely across the house (where a regular non hard wired point wouldn't be able to communicate with a router).  I am paying for 200mbps from cable company but getting 230-240 on all my tests, hard wired and wifi, which is amazing and anywhere from 3-5 times what I was getting.  This is a better/cheaper solution than buying the 3 pack with 2 points unless you really want the google speaker functions (which I didn't care about).This would easily be 5 star with better support on hooking up multiple routers in mesh mode, and was so painful I almost gave it 3 stars, but the product simply works really well once setup and is easily managed along with all my other google devices and hue lights thru a single app.

I knew I didn't need a ton of horse power on it, and the price had to be cheap.This tablet for the bill. It was cheap, small and portable, and it already comes with Android 8 plus a bunch of kids games pre installed on it. The carrying case it came with is sturdy, so I'm not worried about my son or daughter dropping it. For the most part I can tell it has a pretty stock version of Android installed. So I could install apps from the play store easily. For my use cases, the tablet was surprisingly useable. I thought the performance would be horrible, but given the price point it's actually pretty good. Its not your high end tablet snappy, but this is better than my fire 8, which sometimes has trouble switching apps and scrolling.If you are looking for a cheap tablet for your kids, I would recommend this one.

He loves his learning games and music. Before my kids like play my phone but now they’re not. Can't stress enough about the case . it islightweightbest product.Front and back camera also.
",0.99292588246,pc,"I’ve been wanting a basic tablet for my 3 year old son so when I saw this one was geared towards kids I decided to get it.The tablet itself is the perfect size to fit in his hands and the case does a great job at protecting the tablet when it gets dropped. (Because we all know 3 year olds drop things)The tablet comes preinstalled with 20 different games that work for many different age groups. The Looney Tunes Phonics game is one of them and it’s excellent at teaching letters and the sounds they make. My son is around the age of learning letters and sounds so we’ve used this a few times and will continue to. A few apps he personally likes to play are ABC world, Game kids 5 and body parts for kids. (All are preinstalled on the tablet).Another great thing about this tablet is the parental controls. I honestly had to unblock a few things when I first got the tablet because so many things were blocked. The “kids corner” app is where all of the apps you want your child to use can be put into. This app is password protected so you can’t get out of it unless you use a password, so no worrying about your child getting into other things on the tablet that you don’t want them to use. You can also set a timer for how long you want your child to be on the tablet.The operating system is ok, it runs on Android 8, it’s not the fastest thing in the world so it takes patience for some of the things to load and the touch screen can be finicky at times but he’s able to play games ok. I’m not sure if I got a bad one or not but the charging cord and port are loose so I’m not sure how long the charger is going to last.  The tablet can also get a little warm at times but all and all it’s a nice basic tablet.Updated 11/1/19: I have revised my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because of the excellent customer service I received about the loose charger (which actually did end up breaking after my initial review) . I emailed Contixo and told them what happened with my charger and they sent out a new one to me free of charge!

She likes the YouTube kids apps, which allows her to watch cartoons, kids shows or listen to music.  She needed help with getting interested in some homework (recognizing sight words), and we found some apps in the playstore that did mostly what we wanted, but the issues were not the tablets fault.  The games work fine and she seems to learn how to maneuver around pretty good.  She is a fast learner.  I just have to remember to keep it charged up, but it makes life so much easier.

Fast processing speed and responsive touch screen. We like to monitor and limit our kids' use of technology, so parental controls are a must-- we were able to easily disable apps we don't want our son to access freely.

I normally have to log into my laptop to do many of the important jobs since I don't like to work from small devices, but this thing just makes life so much easier. There's plenty of storage space at 64gb and it comes pre-installed with minimal apps, which is great since I hate it when some of the more well known brands cram as many useless apps into their devices as possible, which I end up removing anyway. The rear cam can do full HD whereas the front only does VGA, but not a problem with me since I don't intend on using it for taking pictures anyway. There are two built in SIM card slots and an extra slot for an SD card also. It's literally a large mobile phone. The battery life isn't bad either as it can go all day on a full charge (yes I let my 4 year old daughter watch YouTube on it) and it takes roughly around 4 hours to fully charge.

",0.920756449,pc,"UPDATE: TAKING BACK POSITIVE REVIEW AFTER 4 DAYS!!!Disregard previous review as far as screen goes. Have used this laptop for 4 days. And something is wrong with the screen. I'm attaching pictures. It's a computer issue, bad display, poor quality screen. I haven't taken this laptop anywhere, not dropped it, not put it through anything rigorous in 4 days. Have had no food or drink near it. No one else has used it. Just saying all that to show that nope, I didn't do anything to cause this weird screen glitch. I first noticed the icon looked weird in the taskbar, and then it's like the weird marks got a bit longer and now this is what I see -- weird streaks on the bottom center, by the taskbar and going into the main window area. This is pretty unacceptable after having this device for only 4 days and using it just a couple of hours a day -- and most of that time was spent setting it up. What a disappointment. Buyer beware, you DO get what you pay for. I was hoping this would suit basic needs but not with the screen no longer working properly. What a shame. I give up with HPs, too, this is the last time I am having problems with one. Save yourself the same headache and PASS on this laptop.UPDATE 2: I also have to uninstall and reinstall my printer every day bc it starts to print only in b&w. I have NEVER had this issue with any other laptop, tablet, or phone printing. So just adding a last update to say now I would give it negative stars if possible. Wow was this a dud. Gets worse every day. No choice but to return and hope for full refund. Something is definitely wrong with the machine I got  - maybe it's just a bad egg but I am not taking any more chances on this model or any similar HP. :(ORIGINAL (before issues came up and got worse): I needed a replacement for my old laptops but didn't want to spend a lot. I only need this for some regular word processing and small work projects, light web browsing, basically something to have at home when I need to work on a project or want a bigger screen than my phone when on the internet. This laptop works even better than I hoped for. It is quick, sleek, and easy to use. The screen resolution isn't the best, but I don't need it to be - I'm not using it for video, etc. It is fast considering the specs, actually more than I expected. It seems pretty reliable, shipped same day, and I had it set up in one evening. Interesting keyboard - good feel to it, smooth, but the letters and numbers look oversized. Maybe that's just me - in any case, I actually appreciate it esp since not backlit. I recommend this for basic use and think it's pretty cool given the price.

I am software engineer by profession and I spend 3-4 hour a day working from home.I needed a monitor that could work with my MacBook and I was on a budget. I looked at lot of monitors but as with most budget monitors they has one thing missing or other.I wanted few things in my monitor1- Display port, it gives exception result in font quality. HDMI works well when you have a 4k monitor.2- Adjustable stand (it in an awesome completely practical stand)3- Speaker (Speakers aren't really great and this is what you expect from a 2watt speaker)I had almost purchased view sonic monitor and then this monitor popped up. I liked the fact that it has 360' stand and it really works.It was really a difficult decision to buy this monitor since it doesn't have a lot of reviews and it just launched but so far it working great and my eyes are thanking me after a long hours of coding.Also, I am getting full 75hz on my mac!Cons-The menu buttons are at the back side which makes it really difficult to guess which button does what-There are two power buttons! please, who ever came up with this weird design deserves a pay cut! MAKE SURE TO TURN ON BOTH POWER BUTTONS, otherwise you will struggle like me.-Also, the round button is for navigation, learned the hard wayOVERALL the only downside is the menu button but thankfully you wont be using them every day.I am happy with the purchase and for money I paid I think it is a good buy!

Amazon was very good about returning it but I live in a small town that our mailing store could not use the return label and I had to drive to a UPS store. That is about 35 minutes away. So over an hour to return both directions, and that doesn't even cover trying to re-package it.The replacement monitor had the same issue so I figured it was me and hired my IT guy to come and show me what I must have been doing wrong. He could not ,it did not work either. So now I'm out an hour pay to the IT guy and still no monitor. So Amazon was real good about returning it but I needed a monitor not all these headaches.Ended up buying one from a local store and it worked as soon as I plugged it in.

",0.74991357358,pc,"It's a perfect product. Actually, I was worried about the high response speed(OD) setting with ghosting after using aw2518h. It is definitely an upgrade from aw2518h. The quality is also very good, color is very good, and even if you set the response speed to Super Fast, there is no ghosting. And monitor holding power is soooooo perfect  I love that  and I was not interested about rgb on the back of the monitor, but the rear design of aw2518hf is so beautiful. And I used kd25f monitor and aw2720hf rgb is completely different from Kd25f's rgb. Aw2720hf rgb is like lights of Audi r8 headlight or 2020 Benz S class inside interior Led . I only plays fps game and I am satisfied with the speed. If I must find cons : The monitor is white, so it can get dirty over the years (It depends on how you use it). And the response speed is a little slower than tn panel, but I don't care because it doesn't differ much from 3ms and 1 ms gtg. But it's different quality compare with Tn panel (6bit + frc).Cable management is much better than Benq. It is so tight and clean while Benq's red circle is too big.(I do not hate BenQ I love BenQ too.)Will new products be released only on ips panels after 2020? They don't make Tn Panel anymore??I have a question. I know the Aw2720hf launch price is 599 dollars and this is a complete new product  so why is it so cheap at Amazon?I bought this product yesterday, but defective panel came to me and asked for an exchange, but I will get this product again and my friend will buy it too.

",0.76202559558,pc,"Is this monitor objectively ""good""? Let me say yes. The quality was fantastic. And the item came perfectly intact with no issues. 240 hertz IPS is a relatively slim selection at this point in time. I come from a Dell 144 Hertz g-sync 1440p monitor. I really wanted something with much higher refresh rate for the shooters that I play. but what I realized after extensive use of my 1440p is that no matter how great the monitor is, going down to 1080p for me personally just gave up way too much visual quality. so my complaint is not really with the monitor itself since it works exactly as designed has great colors and is buttery smooth. I got back some of the quality by increasing the resolution scale in certain games and adding a little bit of sharpening but at that point you are using the same amount of vram as you were on a 1440 screen, yet you are sacrificing pixels per inch. So then at that point why have the monitor? as I said this is a fantastic piece of equipment just know why you are buying it before trying it out. hopefully by mid 2019 we have some 240 hertz 1440p IPS displays to choose from and I will definitely snag one.

",0.21324402159,pc,"I use these with a PS4 and am happy with them, though I must confess these are the only ""gaming"" headphones I've ever used, so I really have no idea whether they are better or worse than the competition.  I do have a Razer Blade Pro laptop which is the best laptop I've ever owned (including MacBook Pros) and therefore chose these almost exclusively based on my very positive past experience with Razer products.As far as comfort, I definitely would give them 5 stars. They are very lightweight and ""cool"" in the sense that they don't start to feel warm after a while.  No matter how many consecutive hours I use them, they are always totally comfortable and it never feels like my ears start to sweat or like i need to take them off for a break.  I actually forget I'm even wearing headphones.What I do hate is the volume control.  It's a dial on the cable just like almost every other headphone, but the problem is it's a very free-wheeling, almost spinning dial.  It's not a ""tight"" dial where it doesn't move unless you actually put your fingers on it and turn it up or down, or the type where it makes a little click as you turn it up or down a notch.  Consequently, everytime you move (eg change positions or reach for a drink of water), it rubs  against your clothes and the volume turns up or down.  You can't just set the volume and forget it.  It seems like every 15-30 minutes I have to check to make sure it's still at the volume I want.  Eventually you get used to the constant checking, but they definitely could have done a better job designing it.  It makes no sense to me.  I've used many different types of headphones (for music, etc) that have a similar volume controls but none where the slightest touch changes the volume.I don't use the microphone so I have no opinion on that.  I can say that it retracts nicely into the headphones so that you don't even know it's there.If the headphones weren't so comfortable and if I wasn't already a fan of Razer products, I'd definitely drop my rating down to three stars due to the volume control issues, might have even returned them.  As a matter of fact, after reading my own review, I think I should contact them to find out whether this is really the way they intended it to work or whether I got a defective pair.

I was pleasantly surprised that they even sounded better. I like the fact that the mic is retractable, and there is a volume adjuster on the cord. For me, this headset is a no-brainer, best for the buck buy.

",0.15440723359,pc,"I'm in love with this headset. There is absolutely nothing I have against this headset in it's use so far and I would highly recommend it. I've been recording myself doing test runs of certain games and the clarity of sound is top notch for something in the $$ price point. The glasses hooks are well placed and I love that the metal frame COVERS the ""earmuffs"". While it limits the ear pad mobility, I'm confident that these will last way long than my last Razers. They're 1,000x more comfortable as well.The length of the cord is also a plus. It says it's about 5 feet, but it feels much longer and has a piece that disconnects for usb adapter, volume control, and is covered in tough nylon. The only downside for that is the volume control meshes with the audio output, and will sometime cut sound from one ear or the other.I haven't had a chance to check the audio of my recordings, so I cannot vouch for the mic itself yet, but my friends have no problem hearing me. I do really appreciate that it is retractable and flexible. I'll give an update when I look into my recordings for that.Overall, awesome headset for the price.

",0.1595155359,pc,"I decided to get this Kraken headset after getting really tired of using a crappy old turtle beach from my previous Xbox for my PC/Hackintosh. They felt like they cracked the top of my skull open after 2-3hrs of use and my ears were sore. I also wanted a headset with a mic integrated for Zoom and for gaming, rather than using a headset AND the Blue Snowball at the same time, even though the acoustics are amazing on the Snowball.My thoughts on the Kraken: Is it worth the hype?I can confirm that this headset DOES live up to the hype and it's not just a brand that ships out crappy equipment for high prices. I can't say the same for some of their other headsets, which have terrible reviews. However, this headset is comfy and functional. Especially Amazon sells it for less than their MSRP, it's a steal.Pros:-Their earmuff cooling technology actual feels legit...-The top of the headset doesn't crack your skull-The mic is retractable, which I LOVE-The packaging gives a great first impression-Includes an extension cable with dedicated mic and audio jack, a nice touch for large desks like mine-Can wear easily for hours on endCons:-The lower volume range with the volume dial, located on the audio cable, absoluley sucks. Not sure if this is just my unit, but as you use the integrated volume dial to go from high to low volume, you'll notice the balance between left and right just randomly shifts. This is surely annoying while gaming to adjust the volume. If you have this issue, I suggest turning the volume all the way to high, then use your keyboard to adjust the volume on the OS side, rather than the hardware side-The mic is a little finicky with MacOS on my Hackintosh, not sure why but I'll keep working with it.-The ears are a little bigger than I imagined, but I feel like this may end up saving my ears throughout its life.-I wish the cable came with an integrated voice-chat/game volume balance feature, similar to Turtle Beach on Xbox. I understand the tournament edition includes this, but not sure if that is worth the $40 premium. A redesign of that stupid USB unit with the tournament edition would make this headset the best, hands down, headset on the market for $60-100.Summary:Both pros and cons considered--I love this headset. Of course, it has some flaws, like all things in technology do. Over the next few generations of this headset, I'm sure Razer will introduce some killer features to dominate the gaming market. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a headset that's comfortable, functional, stylish, and inexpensive. With the features included in this headset, there's nothing better out there that $60-70 can buy.
",0.23485186759,pc,"Got the pair of Razer Kraken 2019 Black while it was on sale for around $60 bucks to replace my old pair of Razer Carcharias from back in 2010 and it is definitely a large step up over those pair.  It works as intended and I believe the pricing is fair for what it is suppose to do.  Always appreciated the non-RGB clean/stealth look the black pair provides and it looks great paired with my razer orochi and razer arctosa (black ver.).  Haven't had any problems with the audio quality besides a mediocre bass but the added support of the 7.1 Surround Sound software from Razer works fantastic and makes up for that. You will need to register the product onto your RazerID in order to receive an activation code for the 7.1 Surround Sound software from Razer. Comfort is great and way better than I had thought especially with the cooling gel cushion feature that the ear pads provide but it doesn't necessarily nullify all the heat, it does still get warm from hours on end of usage but that's unavoidable and expected from wearing these sort of gaming headset.  Mic works great and is actually way better than I had imagined.  No complaints overall besides the sub par bass and maybe some connective issues that is easily resolved by either resetting your PC or replugging the audio jack a few times.  I would test out if the headset is properly connected by listening to a few sound tests whenever I encountered this issue but that has only happened once.  Shouldn't be a deterring factor honestly.Overall, I really do enjoy these headset quite a bit and it works as it is suppose to.  It's not necessarily the best music listening headphones and it is not the worst but it gets the job done.  It's definitely well worth it if you you ever get a chance to see the headset on sale but regardless it's a fairly priced product at $80.  But if you are a fan of razer products and understand the ecosystem such as using razer synapse and/or just like how it looks, I would definitely grab a pair!
",0.86313873560,pc,"To give some context, I'm a 10+ year Apple laptop user that wanted to make the jump to a Chromebook a couple months ago. Everyone was raving about the Asus434, so I went for it. Since then I went through two more of the same laptop because of issues. The experience was so frustrating, and I was about to totally give up. Until out of nowhere Asus drops the C425. A lot of this review will compare the two since that was my experience.After handling the Asus434 and the aluminum build, it feels like the C425 doesn't have that. I could be wrong, but it feels somewhat plastic (and maybe it is). It still looks clean, but I noticed the difference. The screen on the C425 looks great. I don't know the specs on whether it is the same setup as the 434 (which looks amazing), but it's really nice. There's a thin black frame on the screen that I really appreciate. Having also tried out the HP x360 Chromebook, I appreciate the way Asus tries to maximize the screen without putting a thicker black frame with their logo on it.The biggest wins for me with this computer (after only a few days of having it) is that I haven't had the screen flicker randomly (which happened all the time with the 434). And probably the most important part for me is that the selling price is more reasonable (in my opinion) than what the 434 (8-gig) was/is. For a Chromebook that expensive it should handle a lot better than what it was. I will also say it's slightly lighter than the 434, which I'm a fan of.Lastly, I thought that losing the 2-in-1 feature and touchscreen would be a deal breaker, but so far it's been fine. Like anything, I guess you gotta know what you want the computer for and when you'll actually be using it. They may be deal breakers for you, but it also might be giving it a test drive to see if you can live without it. So far, after two months of frustration and research, I think I've landed on the Chromebook for me.
",0.15771758660,pc,"I bought this computer because I believed that the only differences with the C434 were that this is a clamshell (no hinges), that it has more RAM and that it doesn't have touch screen. I could live with those differences.But there is another one that Asus does not advertise: the c434 is full aluminium and this is half plastic. The bottom half of the computer is made of cheap plastic instead of aluminium.I didn't want to buy a cheap plastic computer, not at least at this price point.P.S. After a couple of weeks I can add:1. At 399 the half plastic design is more understandable (but It cost me a lot more so I am keeping my rating).2. Everythings works fine save for the Wi-fi. Many times my computer can't connect to the internet while my phone does. So the quality here is not so good either
",0.2423111260,pc,"Just bought a couple days ago.  The Touchscreen feature being omitted didn't bother me as well as the 360 fold flat feature on the C434.  These were items I could live without. What was the primary decision was the 8gb processor which makes surfing the web and such quick and lag free.  Very pleased so far.
",0.87822055860,pc,"General impression is good for the price I bought this for ($399 on sale). However, if it is priced at the MSRP of $500 I'd consider the C434 more strongly. I went into this purchase wanting 8 gb RAM and not needing a touch screen so this device fit my needs for a lower price.Construction: Very solid, despite it being a plastic body (not aluminum like C434). Good fit and finish. Design is very attractive.Keyboard: Sturdy keys with good amount of travel and feel.Track pad: Surface area is large. Material is plastic and not as smooth as glass versions so I would advise using a mouse for extended use (which I was planning to do anyway).Sound: Won't blow your mind, but volume is loud and satisfying. Speakers face down underneath device.Screen: Narrow bezels are great. Matte surface with minimal glare. Images of are generally good quality,  but I've certainly seen displays with better color and sharpness. Non-touch display.Performance: Very good for my casual use which includes streaming one HD movie with a browser running 3-4 tabs for work. I think this device can handle much more since it has 8 gb RAM.Noise: No fan, completely silent.
",0.96106791560,pc,"I recently decided to step into the Chromebook world since I wanted something between my Fire tablet and my gaming laptop that I could quickly grab when I needed to do things online. I see a lot of reviews comparing this to the Asus C434, but since I've never used one of those I can't make a comparison.I briefly used a cheaper Asus Chromebook (C423), but the display on that was so bad it prompted me to return it for this model. The C423 had washed out colors, a lower resolution, and terrible viewing angles. This display has none of those issues. Colors a good and viewing angles are comfortable regardless of the angle you have the hinge open to. The Core m3 and 8GB of RAM may be overkill since I'm mainly using this for the web browser and watching movies, but coming from a gaming laptop I'd rather have the extra power and not need it than vice versa. All that plus the baklit keyboard makes this everything that I was looking for in a Chromebook.My only criticism is that the bottom of the Chromebook gets somewhat warm while charging, and VERY warm whenever I'm watching videos. There are no fans on this thing to cool it, so if your intention is to set this on your lap and watch videos you'll want one of those laptop cooling pads to set it on or it will get uncomfortable.
",0.76929497760,pc,"The specs on this chromebook are amazing, so I bought one.  I had trouble viewing the keyboard, especially with the backlighting on as other reviewers have noted. The characters on the keys are cutouts, like a face carved in a Halloween pumpkin, so there is no contrast in a non-dark room when the backlight is on. You can't read the keyboard! If you turn the backlight off, every little ray of ambient light that reflects on the keyboard also kills the contrast and makes it unreadable. It's awful. Had I used the C425 for a minute in a store, that would have been a deal-buster. However, I tried to work past that by taking it with me to my usual locations where i work. The long and short of it is that the C425 does a poor job of pulling in WIFI connections. With my old HP chromebook, I had no such troubles at the exact same locations where the C425 can't find a connection. I *REALLY* wanted to love the C425 but that was a  deal-buster. I packed it up and sent it back.  I see from the comments above that others have experienced the poor WIFI reception, too, so I suspect it's a design/construction flaw, not a problem with my particular unit. Sigh...
",0.0213719960,pc,"No complaints. I don't mind the plastic bottom. It won't scratch any wooden surfaces. With 8 GB RAM the ASUS C425 replaced my old Acer R11 Chromebook and it is much faster. Actually its faster than that my Acer Windows 10 laptop with  16 GB of RAM.
",0.88558739460,pc,"I purchased this from Amazon just a few weeks ago. It replaced an Asus Chromebook C423NA, which was my first foray into Chromebook (June 2019). That earlier Chromebook was good... but because I rely on a few key Linux programs (including a GIS heavyweight, QGIS) it wasn't keeping up. And a few Android apps that I rely on were not running fast enough (i.e., Evernote). Also the screen was so-so, with a lower resolution.Then I saw this C425 on sale at Amazon. Twice the RAM, much better screen (1080), better processor.And that has made all the difference! This Chromebook is amazing for the price. Everything works so much better and looks so much better on this Chromebook! Then you add the backlit keyboard and it makes it a winner.My only complaint is the rather cludgy power supply: it is the same size as the C423NA, but with a much thicker cord from the power supply to the Chromebook AND a very thick ~30"" 3-prong power cord. Don't know why they did that. Fortunately, it still tucks away in a slim laptop bag that I got. That is why I couldn't give it a 5 star rating.- Battery life is very good (8-10 hours)- Performance is very good. Obviously, this is not for heavy-duty gaming.... but it handles everything else very well.- The screen is not a touchscreen, but that's not a problem for me, as I'm a touch typist. I have an Asus Windows 10 laptop with a touchscreen and I rarely use the touchscreen on that device. Other than that, the screen is clear and bright, with good color rendering. I prefer its matte glass finish over shiny.Bottom line: this Chromebook is even better than expected! I HIGHLY recommend it!

",0.05782234762,pc,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1562,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.

(UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

Managed to install the Google Play Store and all the apps that were on my old 7th generation Fire HD 10 are up and running again. I'll be further evaluating and update with any issues or bugs should they revel themselves.
",0.2009450262,pc,"I l logged in to increase my rating but my review was not there.  In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.  Hint to Tech Support:  Recommend this to callers if your hour+ of support does not produce results.
",0.20762804262,pc,"The tablet is awesome! it is really fast and it is really smooth. I have the Fire HD 8 and it's not nearly as fast or smooth at this tablet. Plus with the Anker Type C PD charger, I've been able to charge this tablet at 16 watts! Fast charging, type c, faster wifi, faster processor, and etc... this tablet is a steal at 149 dollars!
",0.90140092462,pc,"Have not set it up. I had bought the charging dock for this new tablet. Guess WHAT it does not CONNECT TO THE CHARGING DOCK.
",0.84786665463,pc,"Pros:__________• The tablet design is almost an uncanny resemblance to the IPad Pro. Pencil thin, smooth corners, and overall minimalistic design. This is a premium feel all around.• The screen is beautiful in every way. I want to highlight that the blacks are excellent and color context matches the brightness level you apply for the screen. For this to be an HDR10+ certification in viewing, I have nothing bad to see on this.• Watching YouTube videos at 1444p make this tablet one of the best in viewings. No more generic 1080p.• The bezels fit well with this tablet. Because of how light it is, I can use one hand to hold it without any issues, and I have enough room so I don’t touch the screen. One of few times that a bezel design comes in handy.• Don’t worry, the bezel layout is small enough to create an immersive experience, especially at night.• The aluminum back reduces the fingerprints for just the screen and provides a little more protection if you drop it. I never loved the glass back and Samsung has listened.• The S-Pen also has a minimalist design that fits right in the back of the tablet. Nothing on look and feel doesn’t create the impression of being cheap.• Got to love the USB-C port. Fast charging, importing, exporting files, and cheap to get extra chargers for the S6.• The S-Pen Air Action gestures are more useful than Samsung’s previous products. Because of the size of the screen, I found even swiping left to right and switching cameras an easy perk when using the Air Actions.  I can see anyone who wants to make PowerPoint presentations with the S6 a great selling point, as the S-Pen does a decent job with the simple Air Actions.• Very comfortable to write with the S-Pen (more details later on). Smooth and the right amount of pressure.• A battery notification immediately pops up on the right side of the screen every time I put the S-Pen back in its location (which has some magnets). I didn’t realize who useful this is since the notification lets me know if didn’t place the S-Pen in the correct location.• I got around 90 minutes for a full charge of the S-Pen, but you really shouldn’t worry as it will always charge on the S6.• I’m happy that you can attach the S-Pen on the side of the screen when you’re not using it, just like the IPad does for their pen.• Multi-tasking is spot-on. Samsung offers a lot of little software perks that makes multi-tasking not only easy, but I felt use this feature on a daily basis.• With the one button on the S-Pen has, you can customize to what you want to open with it.• I’m never a fan with tablet cameras, due to most phones have better equipment, but I got to hand it to Samsung on the built-in ultra-wide lens mode. An insane 123 degree made taking a picture with anything, show the whole world around it. For a quick family photo, it’s perfect. But then again your phone should be your main camera.• The gaming on this is very pleasant. I advise that when playing any high power game you switch the Samsung’s new feature called Game Booster. This feature will kill any apps that are taking away power from the tablet, so you can have more hours of gaming.  I didn’t test the comparison of how much a difference, but when playing any game on a tablet you want as much power as you can.• Playing Fortnite gave me 30fps and no lag what so ever.• One awesome feature Samsung has is the Transparency option. It’s basically a white page over your screen, which is transparent, so you can write on it while reading or watching a video.  I found this feature an excellent perk for taking notes or reading anything on the web. Everyone will find this very useful to have.• Dex Launch is pretty on point of what a windows desktop looks like. It takes around 5 seconds to load up, but when done, it looks like you’re staring into a Windows OS. Overall the layout works fine as one cool benefit I found is any app you click in DeX mode will pop up as a small window, rather than taking over the screen as a whole (no lag when I was watching Netflix in Dex mode). Also moving back and forth from android to Dex is a quick experience.• Battery life I’m getting around 13-14 hours. That’s around 70% brightness, mostly web and movie watching.  The killer in this is the gaming and the pen, if you’re using it a lot.• As you may already know, with this price, you know it’s fast. Opening up 10 apps, numerous web browsers, and an active gaming, the S6 took it in quite well.  For the average day speed will not be a problem.• Cheaper than an IPad Pro, and you get a Pen.• If you have ever used a Samsung device, you’ll feel right at home.Cons and Oks:__________• The fingerprint scanner is an optical sensor. It’s embedded in the screen but, not being an ultrasonic scanner, it can be fooled. With the technology of ultrasonic scanner already established, why install this? But it’s still responsive so it depends on your security requirements (You can just make a passcode if you’re still unsure).• Not headphone jack. A big turn off for those who see this for video editing on the go, or really anyone.• I’m not a fan of having the S-Pen in the back of the tablet.  Not only does it increase the chances of getting scratched when placing it back there, but the magnets on the back are not strong enough to make sure that the S-Pen stays on. You place the tablet on the ground, the S-Pen is the only form of contact with the surface are you place it on.• It’s a hassle to find the right location on placing the S-Pen correctly.  The back has a dip in the section where the pen goes but if you don’t put it in the correct way the S-Pen will fall off.  I have to make sure that it’s attached correctly because it’s impossible to identify, by touch, in which way to put the pen. There is a notification on screen to tell you when it’s connected, but why could’ve they create the charging station on the side so we not only put it in the right place, but we can see it all the time.• What I love about Samsung Galaxy Phones is the ability of how they hid their S-Pens, but this one is not hidden at all. To me, it feels similar to carrying the headphone jack adaptor. I’m not going to use all the time, but I still need to carry it because I may use it at random times.• The way Samsung design this, if you lose the S-Pen you feel like you lost a part of the tablet. With the open face S-Pen placement design in the back, if you lose the pen then it just likes a tablet with a dent in the back.• The Air Action gestures are only good for PowerPoint presentations and taking pictures. I couldn’t see the benefit of using this feature other than that.• As a personal video editor, this isn’t the best around. The S6 struggles to import 4k videos and it took numerous hours to encode an 8-minute video. Keep in mind that I had a decent amount of layers, but it’s still something to know if you wanted to know how fast exporting with Adobe is. Also note that editing in the program, while using the S-Pen, is excellent.• A major issue when drawing with this is the S-Pen’s shortcut button on it. I used the app Medibang Paint, and when drawing I’ll always press the shortcut button on the S-Pen by mistake. The way the button is designed, it’s right where your hand grip is when you write. Numerous times I was would be drawing and hand would press the S-Pen button.  This would immediately bring me to the shortcut page. I don’t know if this is an app issue, but this button problem needs to be fixed.• There is still a gap when you move with the S-Pen. It’s not much, but it’s there. I still had no issues to write notes with, but for those who want to draw it’s a heads up.• It does have face unlock, but it’s a 2D-based facial recognition. I’ll trust the fingerprint scanner first.• The camera is decent but even the ultra-wide format I saw it in a lower resolution. Stick to your phone. Video calls are fine, but other than that, forget it.• Again, the way Samsung design the tablet, because of the built-in S-Pen charging design, you’re somewhat forced to folk over $179 for “there” book cover. Because of the S-Pen, you have no choice if you don’t want the S-Pen to get scratch, or lost.• The speakers are decent, you get four of them.  I found the sound is very clear and loud.• Bixby voice command is the same throughout Samsung’s devices. The microphone the S6 has I didn’t get any issues of feedback.•  It’s very thin, but will bend if semi-force is applied.Bottom Line:__________Samsung for the past year has up its game in phones and tablets. Having posted reviews of their phones and tablets I can say that the S6 is another one in the books, but does have noticeable drawbacks.To summarize, if you want an IPad Pro but can’t afford it, then this what you’ll buy. The S6 is very fast, doesn’t heat up in gaming or video editing, and it’s a definite win for those who need to take notes (work, college, etc.). It has a beautiful image resolution with the bonus of having there S-Pen. I know that the goal Samsung is after the same as Apple, a replacement for the common laptop, and the S6 is right on point. If you get the keyboard cover than you have a pretty good package of the tablet, a pen, and a keyboard (with a trackpad!).But I think Samsung’s goal is also the problem.  They’re trying to make a laptop replacement with a tablet that lacks the internal hardware to support it. For web and basic programs, this is sure a good find, but other than that you start getting issues. On the design side, I’m not a fan of the S-Pen layout. You’re not going to use the S-Pen every time, but the way the S-Pen is placed, you’ll have to make sure that its place correctly. This could’ve been fixed if they added more magnets in the S-Pen holder.In the end, it’s a lower IPad Pro replacement. Still very fast and effective, but graphic power still goes to the IPad Pro as well as the Apple Pen.  With Samsung’s Android OS on their phones, in this tablet, and the upcoming watch, Samsung wants to be your only tech user.Overall: A great tablet for the day to day drawers and note-takers, but still not a laptop replacement.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer
",0.563,pc,"I received the Samsung Tab S6 the day it was released, which was nice. It has a beautiful display. As a photographer, my pictures look really good. So far I've discovered a couple of downsides that would make me consider returning it. I purchased a 512 gb microsd card for it and that works super. The Samsung SmartSwitch software allowed me to transfer my current Note 8's information to the S6 in about 40 minutes. I had a ton of data on the Note 8 with a 128 gb microsd card and the wireless transfer was much faster than expected. It transferred all of my installed apps along with the data. I didn't realize it but my wake up alarm this morning came from both my phone and tablet! LOLThe magnetic stylus which is clipped to the back will fall off a lot of the time, especially if you put it down. The stylus is attached via a small grove and is connected via a magnet. I've already lost it several times and had to spend a lot of time searching for it. I have the keyboard cover on order which is supposed to arrive next week. That has a cover which I think will cover up the stylus and keep it in place. I would NOT recommend buying the unit unless you buy the cover which is another $170 or $90 if you buy soon.The next problem is the unit is too big to hold with one hand and is slippery. It will slide out of your grip easily and there goes $800 to the floor. Depending on what you're doing the thin bezels mean that you have to put your thumb on the display to hold it with one hand and I found that I kept accidentally selecting a link on the side of the display. Plan on using it with both hands without a cover to hold onto. Hopefully the cover will make it easier to handle.All of the videos hyping the unit seem to always show the tablet on a stand or with the keyboard cover attached. I've yet to see one review with someone trying to hold the tablet by itself. The tablet is so wide that it's a stretch for me to hold the opposite edge so my other hand is free to do other things. After a few minutes, my hand gets cramped from reaching across the tablet and hold it. If you put a thumb on the display to hold it with one hand, if there is a clickable area under your thumb, you will accidentally do something unexpected.In retrospect, I would not buy this tablet. It costs almost as much as my MacBook Air which is a real computer but I'm a sucker for new shiny things.  May revisit this review after a little time but I spent almost $900 after tax on the top of the line unit and it is not as neat as I hoped. It is unbelievably light!Update 9/9/19 - After a couple of days of usage, my comments are still pretty much the same. By itself, the tablet is difficult to use one handed due to its size and tiny bezels. Plus, I've discovered that the screen lock will often lock up the unit and not allow you to unlock the screen. Swiping up the display does nothing and it doesn't recognize my fingerprint, or face. When this happens, it's taken a lot of trial and error to get it unlocked. It's like the unit sees the request to unlock but doesn't do anything. This only seems to happen when the tablet has been asleep for a while, such as overnight.On a positive note, battery life seems really good. If you put the unit down overnight it will only lose a percent or two of battery after sleeping overnight.The Samsung Tab S6 is FAST! I have a Nexus 7 and another 7 inch tablet and this one runs rings around them. Looking at photos which are 1-2 mb in file size, you can instantly flip between pictures. If I could hold it, I think I'd love it and Amazon has just updated the ship schedule for the Keyboard cover to arrive in three days. I can't wait.
",0.18428483663,pc,"Updated review after 2nd keyboard cover delivered.I have removed 2 stars. I purchased this device as a work device. However, the $180 keyboard stand designed for the tablet does NOT stay on reliably. The design is not good, and at angles, air is allowed to leak into the back suction cup and the tablet slaps onto the table. It happens every time I have it in my lap, and often when just on a desk.Because this is touted as a ""laptop replacement"", and the thing that makes it a laptop is unusable, I cannot recommend it. Wait until next year.Updated review after one week:I've received the keyboard cover, and while I love it, I am skeptical about the adhesive on the back. Last night I could not get it to stay on, so I cleaned the adhesive and left it stuck overnight, and now it seems better. I have a replacement coming from amazon, because I have very little faith in this one.Apart from that, the keyboard is amazing. it feels great to type on, and the shortucts are very useful. I am not a fan of the tiny backspace key, but overall it is a reasonable compromise. The addition of the trackpad turns it from a ""dockable PC replacement"" to a true laptop replacement.My favorite samsung S-Pen enabled tablet up until this point was the Note 12.2. Even though I liked the tab S4, there were several annoying factors. If you want to use DeX, you really need the device propped upright, and you need either a better face scanner or a fingerprint sensor. Trust me, you'd understand if you tried it on the S4.With the S4, I immediately had speaker envy vs my wife's iPad pro. The sound wasn't even comparable. Given that this is a significant media consumption device, having excellent speakers is a must. The tab S6 speakers sound nearly as good as the iPad pro. They are excellent, and you won't be disappointed.The in-display fingerprint sensor is really great. I have had no problem with lag or unrecognized fingers. Not much more to say, except that it greatly improves the DeX experience and the overall usability. No more looking at the camera at the top of the device, or even worse, when the device is in landscape, trying to figure out where to put your eyes so the camera can see it.Face ID on the iPad pro is so good that you don't have to go through those hoops... but samsung took the easy way out and put in the optical reader under the screen, and I'm really glad they did. I like it better.The S-Pen feels better. I get far fewer unintentional clicks of the button than the bigger round one on the S4. The concept of where they put the pen actually makes sense. Take an iPad with the Pencil... if you want a case, you have to either have one side of the iPad naked, or have some weird extension. The extension makes sense, so you don't lose the Pencil. BUT, if it's on the back, you still have the slim tablet profile, and you don't need a wider case to hold.I had a generic TPU case until I got my official cover in, and just having a case on it makes putting the pencil away MUCH easier.I ALWAYS recommend official samsung cases, as they fit best and feel professional. They are expensive, but worth it.I'm super disappointed that there is no flash on the camera. It really makes a big difference if you scan documents with your tablet. The Note (read: S-pen enabled devices) lineup has always been about productivity, and that means marking up PDFs and photos. Even in Okay lighting, scanning documents requires more light, and a flash should  just be common sense.As for the rest: I got the 6gb 128gb version. My tab S4 had no problem with a million windows, and it had 4gb of ram. This one is quite fast, and handles all of the apps just fine, never any lag with microsoft office and the internet and Adobe running. If you want to photoshop, I always recommend the highest specs possible though.The tablet is thin and light and impressive to hold. The screen is samsung amazing. One UI version 2.0 feels great to use.-Bluetooth 5.0 is nice.- I'd like the bezels to be smaller and the screen to be bigger. I'd gladly buy a 12 inch Tab S6.- Having the SMS messages synced to the tablet makes me so happy. (verizon customers, you are out of luck)- I with there were games optimized for a keyboard in DeX. I'd waste some time on that.- I love the way the case feels
",0.8215653963,pc,"After having bought this tablet and used it for a couple of days, that was what I was asking myself, “who is this for, exactly?” Let’s just say Samsung isn’t reigniting the tablet wars anytime soon with the Tab S6, that War was won, long ago, by Apple. But I really missed the Android eco system, I hadn’t owned a non-Apple tablet in years, the Tab S2, to be exact. I did purchase Google’s Pixel Slate, briefly, in a previous attempt to return to the green guy, but found it to be too unwieldy, buggy, and just plain expensive to justify keeping it.That all being said, I thought the Tab S6 was a bit on the pricy side, but not nearly so much as the Pixel Slate, even with the keyboard, and as Samsung is the biggest Android show in town, it’d be a good place to start again with the OS.I was wrong. I feel like, ultimately, Android doesn’t work on tablets. It’s, as I said before, too unwieldy. Use an Android tablet a day, then use an iPad the following day, you cannot tell me the iPad experience isn’t just more fluid, more usable, just better. But the OS itself wasn’t enough for me to give up on the Tab S6, it also promised great sound, DEX, a desktop environment with the Tab S6, when you add an “optional” $170 keyboard, and a great screen.The Tab S6 delivers on two of these promises, but the 3rd is so poorly done that it ended my experience with this tablet.The sound, is quite good, especially for the size and form factor of the tablet.The screen is very nice. Usual overblown saturated Samsung AMOLED screens, but it looks good and blacks are true.Dex? Horrible. First of all, I remind you that on a tablet that is definitely advertised as a laptop replacement, does not include said tablet. Would these tablet manufacturers PLEASE STOP advertising a product as a tablet replacement and then not include the keyboard? When I add the 170 to the standard 650-750 price for the tablet, and now my “laptop replacement” is pushing well over 900 bucks...might as well get a laptop, right? The CPU / RAM will easily exceed what’s in the S6. And if you want a tablet only device, the newest non-pro iPad has a beautiful screen, great speakers too, and costs about 1/2 as much as the S6.Back to Dex, the reason why it is terrible is that A) you must attach the “optional” keyboard to even use it. B) most, and I mean most, of your Android apps will be nonfunctional in Dex mode, so what’s even the point of it? I don’t need a desktop environment to surf the web, which is all you’ll be doing in Dex mode anyway. It’s just a stupid desktop-like experience to try to justify making you spend 170 just to get into it.So, if you want a pure Android tablet, there are 1000 varieties, much cheaper. Heck, a Amazon Fire tablet is so much cheaper and will give you your basic android experience, buy it instead. If you want a great tablet, buy the cheapest new regular iPad. If you want a tablet that can truly replace a laptop, get an iPad Pro with a brydge keyboard, they are fantastic. But if you truly want an Android/tablet hybrid? Chrome book!! I replaced this with a Pixel book, so much better keyboard, it’s backlit (Tab S6 keyboard is not backlit, for 170? whatever), it still has a good touchscreen, and the Android integration actually works...usually.
",0.89995825363,pc,"I had an Apple iPad Air 2 for four years,  used it 3+ hours a day for news reading and other stuff during that period everyday. It worked great but recently the battery went down quicker than I'd like and processing became a bit sluggish on certain websites and apps.  Understandable given its age.  I selected this S6 over a new iPad pro because of its slightly smaller size and weight,  and slightly higher performance. I've always used Galaxy phones, so Android and iOS both are familiar to me.THE GOOD- Fast.  Nothing surprising given the enhancement in predecessor and RAM.- Swype. Typing on the iPad sucked. It's so much easier on the Tab with Swype.- Transitioning preferences and apps from my galaxy phone worked quite well,  saved time from downloading all of the apps individually (over 100). Took over pw's too.THE BAD- The pen on the back thing is stupid.  The guy who invented this and managed who approved should be fired. This is as dumb as those ridiculous galaxy fold issues.- The fingerprint sensor takes 2+ tries to get in.- Browsers.  I guess I got used to Safari, but I'm spending a lot of time trying to figure out which browser i should use as my primary,  and all have issues... Firefox,  Samsung, Edge, Chrome.- Same with the Samsung Note app. It sucks, big time. Why would you add a pen without a sophisticated note app. Again, heads at Samsung should roll for this incompetence.In summary, this tab is what I'd expect after a four year upgrade from an iPad Air 2, but nothing more,  and nothing terribly innovative.
",0.14382559163,pc,"Nice concept and I believe it's Samsung's best tablet yet. However, for $650-$700 (including taxes and accessories) it has too many short comings that leaves much to be desired. It blows my mind that THEY thought it would be a good idea to add a magnetic stylus to the BACK of the device vice somewhere on the sides (top, bottom, left/right). The ""magnetic force"" isn't all that strong so a case for protection is strongly recommended. That isn't the worst of it! The stylus can be laid on either side to attach BUT it has to be on the CORRECT side for charging. SMH. That is so ANNOYING!!! I'm not a fan of Apple but I can appreciate them perfecting this issue BEFORE IT BECAME AN ISSUE!!! And I will never understand for the life of me why they used old in screen fingerprint reader technology on a ""just hit the market"" device that costs $650-$700!!! It has been years since I've purchased any more Samsung tablets so I was excited to get this one but only to be regretfully disappointed. With that being said, this tablet has been returned and I await their next one with my fingers crossed.
",0.13719165363,pc,"I was really looking forward to my new Samsung Galaxy Tab S6. Please look over the item description... the offer has four months YouTube Premium at no charge included with purchase. I've called Amazon twice (each over 30 minutes - thanks Esther D. for making the phone call long while you cut-n-pasted the unhelpful email - I waxed my car hood while you composed the email, that is the moment the return decision was made) and I've called Samsung.... nobody can help with this simple request. I'm sending it back to Amazon to purchase elsewhere... maybe...poor service from both Amazon and Samsung is making the IPad Pro look attractive.For the tablet - I purchased to use with Lightroom and light office work while visiting friends and family. For the week it has been put to use; Lightroom CC mobile (subscription version) the Tab S6 is quick and the screen beautiful! The stylus makes quick and easy edits! Love it! My light office work is emails, MS Word Docs, PP, and Excel - the Tab S6 handles with eaze.Ths battery life  suits my day away from home- downloading images in the field via cable connection with editing taking about two-three hours. Uploading when I get home.I'm returning because Amazon can not live up to their end of the deal. They had the chance when on the phone with customer service for way too long.
",0.79902410563,pc," When I first received it I was blown away by how well it could handle the multitask. Watching videos and playing games with this this tab is just amazing! Taking down notes and drawing too! But, everything started to go downhill from here as I noticed the digitizer faulty. The screen started ""ghost tapping"" and I had to return the product for a lost. Still, good product tho but I received a faulty one. But I'm giving it 1 star for my experience.
",0.24814575963,pc,"I bought this for upcoming travel.  I wanted to replace my laptop with something lighter.  It had potential but there were two huge problems. #1 is the included stylus kept falling off.  For travel, the stylus would be lost in a day or two.  If you get this, you will NEED a case or cover that helps hold the stylus.  The second and larger issue is the secrren has horrible touch sensativity.  it literally would not detect my finger touching it unless I licked the tip of my finger to make it wet and that only lasted for a few swipes.  This made it totally unusable as I'd use my finger 99% of the time.  I tried for a few hours and finally gave up in frustration.  I ran updates, but no improvement.I later purchased a Samsung Note S5e from Amazon and it is a huge improvement in sensativity.  I'd give the S6 a 1/10 for the touch screen.  I'd give the S5e a 8/10 on the touchscreen.  Touch sensativity was not as nice as my cell phone, but perfectly acceptable.  I also noticed the S6 and the S5e had very comparable and fast performance with day to day application usage even though the S6 has a more powerful CPU.The thing I liked the most about the S6 (and S5e also) was the beautiful screen display.

Although it’s best for the school going kids but it can also be used by adults. It’s complete value for money.
",0.96888601864,pc,"My niece loves this tablet she has bern learning so much because of how many learning apps there are for her to use and they make it easy for her to follow along. I wish they had this kind of thing available when I was her age it would have made learning fun and easy I would definitely recommend this tablet for anyone with small children.
",0.89738428664,pc,"This tablet’s very affordable and sturdy. No matter how many times my toddler’s dropped it, it hasn’t had even a slither of crack. For only $60, you could get your kid a whole tablet THAT IS SAFE FOR CHILDREN! I don’t have to worry about scammers, weird sites, and it breaking anytime soon.

It dosent take long for the apps to start. The blue molding around the tablet makes the tablet easier to grip for little ones. I really like the case the tablet comes in.

",0.94228911465,pc,"I was looking for a low end tablet for my kids mainly so they could watch videos and play some basic games on it. I knew I didn't need a ton of horse power on it, and the price had to be cheap.This tablet for the bill. It was cheap, small and portable, and it already comes with Android 8 plus a bunch of kids games pre installed on it. The carrying case it came with is sturdy, so I'm not worried about my son or daughter dropping it. For the most part I can tell it has a pretty stock version of Android installed. So I could install apps from the play store easily. For my use cases, the tablet was surprisingly useable. I thought the performance would be horrible, but given the price point it's actually pretty good. Its not your high end tablet snappy, but this is better than my fire 8, which sometimes has trouble switching apps and scrolling.If you are looking for a cheap tablet for your kids, I would recommend this one.
",0.93388563465,pc," That’s a great item and I really like it for my kids . My son loves this we got as a birthday present the case is awsome and bounces off pretty much anything.  he can watch his tunes and play games on the gooooo as we all know 2+ year olds never stop. He loves his learning games and music. Before my kids like play my phone but now they’re not. Can't stress enough about the case . it islightweightbest product.Front and back camera also.
",0.99292588265,pc,"I’ve been wanting a basic tablet for my 3 year old son so when I saw this one was geared towards kids I decided to get it.The tablet itself is the perfect size to fit in his hands and the case does a great job at protecting the tablet when it gets dropped. (Because we all know 3 year olds drop things)The tablet comes preinstalled with 20 different games that work for many different age groups. The Looney Tunes Phonics game is one of them and it’s excellent at teaching letters and the sounds they make. My son is around the age of learning letters and sounds so we’ve used this a few times and will continue to. A few apps he personally likes to play are ABC world, Game kids 5 and body parts for kids. (All are preinstalled on the tablet).Another great thing about this tablet is the parental controls. I honestly had to unblock a few things when I first got the tablet because so many things were blocked. The “kids corner” app is where all of the apps you want your child to use can be put into. This app is password protected so you can’t get out of it unless you use a password, so no worrying about your child getting into other things on the tablet that you don’t want them to use. You can also set a timer for how long you want your child to be on the tablet.The operating system is ok, it runs on Android 8, it’s not the fastest thing in the world so it takes patience for some of the things to load and the touch screen can be finicky at times but he’s able to play games ok. I’m not sure if I got a bad one or not but the charging cord and port are loose so I’m not sure how long the charger is going to last.  The tablet can also get a little warm at times but all and all it’s a nice basic tablet.Updated 11/1/19: I have revised my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because of the excellent customer service I received about the loose charger (which actually did end up breaking after my initial review) . I emailed Contixo and told them what happened with my charger and they sent out a new one to me free of charge!
",0.23641517865,pc,"This tablet is really good because is comes with a lot of preinstalled app, has parental controls with Kids Place, and works good for an affordable tablet.  The case has a nice feel..  My daughter uses the tablet while I am busy cooking or cleaning, and gives me a chance to manage household chores uninterrupted.  She likes the YouTube kids apps, which allows her to watch cartoons, kids shows or listen to music.  She needed help with getting interested in some homework (recognizing sight words), and we found some apps in the playstore that did mostly what we wanted, but the issues were not the tablets fault.  The games work fine and she seems to learn how to maneuver around pretty good.  She is a fast learner.  I just have to remember to keep it charged up, but it makes life so much easier.  She was so excited to open it, and often asks to play on it.

We decided to get him an inexpensive tablet with a few educational games. This has turned out to be nicer than our other tablets! There are lots of apps/games already installed, and we linked it to our Google account so it easily synched with the other apps and games we've purchased for our phones. It's simple to use so far. Fast processing speed and responsive touch screen. We like to monitor and limit our kids' use of technology, so parental controls are a must-- we were able to easily disable apps we don't want our son to access freely. The tablet came fully charged and ready to go, complete with a cover to protect it from the inevitable drops. Very impressed with the speed, capabilities, and storage for the price.

Didn't wanna spend a fortune because we weren't 100 percent on how well she would care for it so the fact that it comes with a case is a major plus! The sound is really good on the tablet too. The picture is awesome too. This tablet is worth every penny.

I am glad to purchase this and feel great about my decision. This is a super cute tablet and the size is so mini — it’s perfect for little kid. The case is a thick and durable rubber material. I chose baby blue color and is suitable for my son. The design of the case is protecting the tablet from dropping. There are also three layers of screen protector that prevents it from scratch and it’s also dust proof. The battery life is also great, without internet it can lasts up to half day with continuous usage. You can store and download the video inside. The memory is 16GB but you can slot SD card up to 128GB and that’s a lot of storage for kids. The screen is perfect for little eyes and very bright enough. This is the best way to occupy my son while travel in the car. This tablet has Looney Tunes Phonics games feature that is very educational. It also equipped with parental supervision so that kids won’t browse something that he shouldn’t.

He has already learned to say new words and say his abcs, which he has a learning disability so before you judge, thinking he's 4, he should know that, not all kids are the same. 5 stars is an understatement for my family.

I am providing feedback based on 2++ months real world use of this product.Pros:1) Awesome design2) New Netgear GUI for setup and configuration - very easy to use and fast. I had the router setup in < 5 mins3) Performance is decent out of the box - I expect with future firmware updates, this performance will improve more. Also performance will be better once you have matching AX clients connecting to the router4) No wi-fi drops5) Can handle 20 streaming clients without any issues7) No buffering or stuttering when streaming wireless or wired8) No dead spots in a 3500 sq feet home and coverage (3 bars) 30ft outside of house9) Can create a single SSID which can handle both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz clients seamlessly10) No issues connecting legacy AC wireless devices (Android and iOS)11) No issue with VPN12) Gigabit fiber speed test is 940mb/s up and down with a 2ms ping to testing serverCons:1) Price2) You will need AX clients to really take advantage of this product. AX should be taking off in 2019+3) You will hear the fan when you first power up the router. Also make sure you upgrade to .36 of the firmware after you setup the router to make sure fan does not stay running under normal use4) Would have liked to see 8 gigabit ports for this price point5) Would like to see parental controls, anti-virus add-ons in the futureOverall, I am very happy with the performance of this router (even on the first beta firmware). If you have a router that is more than 4 yrs old or have a household with lots of wireless devices, this router is a good choice.The price is a bit expensive, but the router is well built. I expect performance to get better as firmware starts to mature. I have used the router every day for 2 months and it has worked flawlessly. Have not found any wi-fi dead spots in the house.

Wireless 2.4 and 5 are much slower as well - I'm going to keep looking at these settings but unless I can figure out what's going on, I'm going to return this and go back to my X10.Also - I can't notice any stronger penetration / signal strength with this AX8 than from my X10 - I still need 2 extenders to reach my entire house.
",0.28486877771,pc,"Don't waste your time getting the new AX (wifi 6) tech since its not readily available in devices they said. Don't spend the money cause its gonna be like a normal router for a couple of years until more are released.Let me tell you - ignore that. This is a BEAST. I spent 3+ weeks trying out different solutions on wifi.  I tried Orbi mesh. While that is a good product, I am not really in need of a mesh. Speeds averaged 460-525 Mbps. (I tested at different times of day but same time frames with other products).I tried the XR500 Nighthawk that is one of the highest rated devices with DumaOS. So many issues that I was losing my mind. I tried several fixes. Separate the bands, channels, etc. My security cams were going offline every 30 mins or so for at least 15. I was so fed up with trying to trouble shoot the device. My speeds were 580 - 670 Mbps with it which I did enjoy. But speed is only useful if its actually CONNECTED to the devices.Last ditch effort I tried this router.  The RAX80 and holy moly. Plugged in, used the mobile app and was up within 5 mins. Every device attached with no issues. No disconnects after multiple days use. Speed improvement on every item. I have 38 devices accessing my wifi as part of the smart home. This monster just cranks it out. No problems at all. My speed on several tests as compared to the same day/ time as the ones above - 830-960 Mbps  I am not sure why its such a huge improvement but it is.  I cannot say enough good things about this router. Not only is is a monster with handling speeds and multiple devices - just look at it. It is not one you want to hide. You want to show this baby off. Several people have asked me what the space ship is.  This thing went from being in an Amazon box to installed and cranking out wifi / lan within 10 minutes and NOT a single drop of signal. I am future proof as well. So I say if you can afford it, do not hesitate. You will really like it.EDIT:After 2 months this router is still the best one I've ever seen.  Still getting top level speeds right at a gig. I've got 42 devices attached to it (smart home) and it doesn't even cough. I rarely am this surprised. This router is still #1 in everything I tried!
",0.11836388771,pc,"As in another user, I too, am not willing to pay the price for this router.  My previous router, which I still have, and am going to reconnect, is the Asus Wireless AC3100 Gigabit Router (RT-AC3100). I consistently receive between 230-500 Mbps on wifi.  I sometimes have issues with ip conflicts, which is why I was looking for something more (all my address issues would go away after restarting the router, weird, I know).  After connecting the Netgear router, which also didn't just pick up on my previous wifi settings, my speed dropped to no more than 95 mbps on wireless, with 4 different speed test apps.  At the same time, the Nighthawk app consistently showed over 450 mbps, which I knew to be false. It was false because my pages would take longer to load, and I would experience some buffering issues.  I have over 25 connected devices in my home, including 5 UHD tv's, 3 gaming systems, including a PS4 Pro, 4 computers, several tablets, and 5 mobile devices.  Maybe I will reach out to Netgear to see if my router is faulty, as I am now receiving consistently around 145 mbps.  Is that worth $500?  Not by a long shot!

My devices were hardwired (via CAT5 and a Linksys 10/100 switch model EZXS55W) and others Wi-Fi to a Linksys WRT1900 AC router.  The AT&T service provided a max of 6 Mbps download and .8 Mbps upload.  AT&T did not provide any better service to the area so I needed to go with another (Spectrum) provider.  This new service was for 100 Mbps download and 5-10 Mbps upload.  Considerably better than what I had.  I decided that I would go all out and try to get the maximum benefit from the service and a little future proofing.  I had purchased a Netgear CM600 modem instead of the supplied modem and router from Spectrum.  I also ordered a new switch (Netgear 8 port 10/100/1000 model GS108) for my wired devices.  I also pre-ordered the NETGEAR Nighthawk AX8 8-Stream AX6000 Wi-Fi Router.  My house is around 1700 sq. ft. with a finished basement.  Most of the equipment is in the basement.  The previous modem/router was in the basement.  It covered the whole house.  However, it did not cover any area outside of the house such as the garage and outside the front door.  I particularly wanted the range to go out the front door to potentially add security cameras without having to use Wi-Fi extenders.  I was lucky enough to be able to get the Spectrum cable fished directly from the outside box to the same location as my previous modem/router.  I hooked up the Netgear modem – all good.  I connected a PC directly to the modem (CAT 5) and speed tested at 118 Mbps download and 11 Mbps upload.  Since I did not have the new router yet, I just reconnected the Linksys WRT1900.  The testing PC was then connected to the Linksys WRT1900.  It still speed tested at the same.  However, other PCs hardwired to a switch and then to the Linksys WRT1900 speed tested around the 60 Mbps download and 9 Mbps upload.  Mobile units tested anywhere from 60-90 Mpbs and 11 Mbps upload.  I figured the old switch had a lot to do with the hardwired slower speed.  When the new switch came in, I installed it and that cleared up the speed problem (now 118 Mbps download and 11 Mbps upload) on the hardwired PCs.  Once the Nighthawk AX8 came in, I replaced the Linksys router.  Speed on the mobiles tested in at 117 Mbps download and 11.94 upload.  The overall range of the Wi-Fi increased.  It now covered the whole garage and only started to decrease in strength after moving about 15 ft. from the front door.  As for specifics about the Nighthawk AX8, the unit is stylish. May remind you of something that would come out of a Star Wars or Star Trek show.  If you are looking for an easy set up of a typical home network, it is very simple.  Just follow the instructions in the provided Quick Start guide.  If you need more advanced customization, you need to go to the Netgear support site and download the manual for this unit.  The only instructions included in the box is the Startup guide and a note about upgrading the firmware.  Unit comes with a power supply, network cable and startup guide.  The “wings” (antenna units) were folder flat in the box.  They simply lift up and then push the wings down to snap into place.  Connect the network cable to the modem.  Power up the device.  I downloaded the app on my phone.  The app connects automatically when it is started.  Once connected the app prompted to upgrade the firmware.  I walked through the rest of the setup on my phone app.  Piece of cake.  Having been able to max out the provided service from Spectrum on all my devices was icing on the cake.  The extended coverage was even more so.  I have seen several comments about the fan running on this unit.  It did NOT start running when the unit was powered on.  It has not yet turned on so I cannot comment if it has a noise issue or not.  Firmware level is at 1.0.1.40_1.0.22.  The unit seems to be well made and sturdy.  There were two caveats to the good experience.  Both are concerning the USB connections on the back of the unit.  The first is that the USB connections on the back of the unit are too close to each other.  I usually, put in two 128 GB sticks in the Linksys with no problems.  The ones I used were about 13/16” wide. Way too wide for the Netgear. I would say if you have USBs to use that are wider than 5/8” (maybe 11/16”) two will not fit.  My solution will be to see if I can find a couple of short USB extensions with a narrow end.  Purely a poor design issue.  The other caveat is that there is no information included concerning how to use and configure the USB connections.  You must download the manual to get any initial setup and network mapping information.  Otherwise, I would have given the unit a 5 star on “Easy to Use”.  It is a little pricey at $399.  However, I believe it will take me into future a good way and support any speed and protocol changes for a while.  As long as there are no immediate performance issues that come up, I would readily recommend it.
",0.571,pc,"Update 4/26/19: AX8 lasted only 1 month and 9 days before WiFi download speeds consistently slowed down to half or less than half of it’s original new straight out of the box speeds. Heat dissipation seems to be a problem for AX8 probably due to it’s compactness and design elements (too much plastic covering the perforated metal grill). The high speeds of my 1 Gig Mbps download and 35Mbps upload internet service plan may also have contributed to my AX8’s early demise. So I went back to my “old” X10 and my WiFi download speed instantly went back up to 652 Mbps. and upload speed of 38.5 Mbps. on the very first test. Btw my “old” X10 was consistently faster than my AX8 was when my AX8 was still brand new. Speed tests that were done on my Ethernet connected Apple TV also proved that the AX8 bottlenecked internet speeds. Tests done when Apple TV was wired to the X10 resulted in download speeds of around the 920Mbps to 940Mbps range but when Apple TV was wired to the AX8 (test was done when AX8 was at 1 month and 9 days old), speeds slowed down to the 290Mbps to 450Mbps range. AX8 might only be consistently good for WiFi speeds of less than 400Mbps but don’t quote me on that because I'm only speculating. I’ll hold onto my AX8 just in case Netgear comes out with a firmware update then I’ll update this review again. 3rd pic was taken on 4/26/19 showing speed of X10. —-Original review — AX8 has inconsistent WiFi speeds. Speeds would sometimes drop to 0Mbs even if I walk only 10 feet in any direction. It’s as though this router completely loses track of where I am. If I stay in place I’m usually able to get low to high 500 Mbps. Not only were my Netgear X10’s WiFi speeds more consistent but I could get faster download speeds of up to 645Mbps. I may have to go back to my X10 if Netgear can’t provide a fix. All WiFi tests were done while using a Xs Max and Spectrum’s 940Mbps plan. Modem as provided in Spectrum’s 940Mbps plan is by technicolor. Pic with 645Mbps WiFi speed is with my Netgear X10 router and other pic is with my Netgear AX8 router.
",0.571,pc,"I have 25 years of professional tech experience and 35 years of all around tech experience. Let's start with that just so you know that I am not making noise that is not valid. I have owned many Netgear products. Some good and some not so good. This is one of the good products, or I should say great products that suffer from the chronic issue of horrible Netgear firmware.This router can not remember a simple QOS setting. You define an attached device and 5 minutes later the router does not remember the type of device, the name of the device or the icon assigned to the device. It also drops connections and will run at pathetically slow speeds for some connected devices, even at off hours like after midnight when there is no traffic on the network or the web. Some devices fly, some crawl with no sense or logic.I called Netgear and the told me to flash the firmware over the router's self updated firmware. No improvement. Forgot the devices on the first reboot.On my previous Netgear router I had a USB printer shared that was working with all my nodes but the Netgear USB sharing software can not even connect with this router.I would have fired the developers and the entire QA staff at Netgear but I bet the have no QA staff. I have a lot of empathy for companies but there is no excuse for this level of incompetence at this price level.One more thing...many consumers are not technically experienced enough to flash binary firmware. If they realized that regular average people were part of the marketplace they could be a premier company. Top hardware, terrible, and I mean terrible firmware. I am beyond disgusted. After 20 years of buying their products and waiting, hoping and banking on eventual firmware updates I am done with Netgear with maybe the exception of their 4 and 8 port switches. They are OK.This company needs to fire their management team. This product should not have been released to the public. Time to try a Linksys...or any other brand. Furious!!!Also...to all the Youtube people that review these products...what the hell? Do you get paid to recite the company sell sheets? Do you actually test anything? What the hell?
",0.16839063271,pc,"It looks great, right? It has a quad-core 2.2Ghz CPU, Qualcomm chipset which supports WPA3, OFDMA, etc... I was really excited to get this router, but was really disappointed when it arrived. As shown in the attached pictures, the listing advertises down and uplink OFDMA, however the box says otherwise. Concerned, I reached out to Netgear support asking if they plan to roll out upstream OFDMA or any other wifi 6 features mentioned such as target wait time in a future firmware update and I was told twice ""I cannot promise that it will or it won't."" After paying hundreds of dollars for this router, I was extremely disappointed in both the misleading advertisement and the response from Netgear support. It appears their RAX models 80 and 200 with the Broadcom chipset support both down and upstream OFDMA, but this one does not. So I had to take this for face value and assume the disclaimer on the box was the final verdict. After further research, their product advertisement for the RAX120 on netgear.com only lists OFDMA, while the RAX80 specifically says downstream and upstream OFDMA. I find it very interesting they'd not only release the RAX120 with only downstream OFDMA, but advertise having both down and up in the Amazon listing.Maybe I'm being petty, but that was enough for me to return the product before opening the box. If they told me they plan to add features as they become available, I'd probably be open to keeping it. It's probably a great router, but I feel let down and misled by Netgear.
",0.20913818571,pc,"Just got the router today and set it up.  Kept getting message ""No ethernet connected to the ethernet port"" message.  Called Netgear Customer Support and had problems getting through their automated calling feature.  Finally after 3 attempts I got to a 1st level support who wanted to troubleshoot the WIFI.  After he wasted my time then he transfered me to another level support.  Once this guy enters the router info he is like ""Oh you have a RAX80, thats actually supported by our level 2 department"".  Then he asked me what is the issue to notate it in the ticket.  After explaining the port issue he starts to explain where the ethernet cable is to be plugged in.  I explain to him that I am not new to this.  After being put on hold again to speak with level 2 the level 1 support returns and says it will be 24 hours before they can get back with me.I just spent 400 bucks for this thing.  The Ethernet Port light does not come on and is down.  There is no settings or support documents I can find to determine if it is a setup issue or hardware.  I am now back on my R7000 on the same ethernet outlet, so definitely a router issue.So I have gone through netgear X10, sucked kept dropping the network.  Tried the TP-Link ax6000, sucked FTP would not work properly.  Purchased the Netgear RAX80, suck and crappy, ethernet port would not work.  Tired of these second rate support reading scripts without any actual true training to support these devices.  Tired of these high end routers being delivered with poor QA and no technical support.  Just a bunch of hype about features with lost basic funtionality.My R7000 was having issues with too many devices online and rebooting.  But I rather deal with that then troubleshooting my 400 bucks!
",0.02125459971,pc,"Up time seems to be near 100% for this last month excluding the 5g WiFi which took a few days off for no reason.I have approx 20-25 devices connecting to this router daily.  The old unit simply wouldn’t handle the 4k roku tv boxes for streaming along with our normal usage.  When the roku devices were added the old ac1900 Motorola box would have poor connection, much lower speed, then crash if used heavily.Decided on the ax6000 for future proofing even though there no real reviews of the final product here on amazon.Setup and firmware update were pretty straightforward with wizard assist.  Small hiccup with their android “app” if your logged on with it, you will be logged off on your net genie windows app or through the browser.  Evidently they cannot co-exist for some reason at the same time.Once setup I tested the speeds of the wired ethernet, 2.4, and 5ghz networks.  Put the main computer on the 5ghz net solo for max speed.  All other wireless devices on 2.4ghz for better range.  2.4 ghz range was no better than the old model 2013 box, speeds were improved, just not range.I now have less ip conflicts, no longer have devices that slow or stop connecting.  Testing with 4 tv’s streaming and 2 comps pulling content from a nas was no problem.Odd thing:  the 5ghz network went down for a couple days for no reason.  I switched to wired during the downtime and 2.4 was fine throughout.  Restarted the ax6000 and the problem went away..  used for another 9 days and no problem since.House 2800sqft: no signal issues inside or within 20ft of house.Internet: 200mb down 20mb upCable modem: CM700-1AZNASWould buy again.  Will update if I have any problems down the road.Update: 3 months in 5g network is down again.  Updated the router firmware to 1.56 which automatically reboots the router.  Now 5g is back.  WIll update if it goes down again.  Mind you there is exactly ONE device on this 5g network and it's not on all the time.  No reason this should have downtime.  removing a star until this firmware is tested for reliability.

Already had personal info on the machine, set up for email, etc.  After call to Dell [who was not the 3rd party seller, so had no control over this listing] determined this laptop never had one installed coming off the assembly line.  Contacted Amazon who initially offered refund/exchange but I was really reluctant to do that, first of all because I would have had to scrub this one of personal information and second because they couldn't tell me if the missing drive was a one time occurrence or whether all of them being sold by this vendor were without.  Finally they offered me a partial refund to cover the value of the missing drive.  I opted for that and ordered one [refurb] from Dell that I can install.Having said all that, we like the machine and have no other issues at this point other than discovering Windows 10 has eliminated the Homegroup function so I had to do some research on how to connect to our home networked printer.

These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.1576,pc,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

I purchased this so I could be a bit more flexible in my location for doing college homework, work, and freelance writing without being tied to my desktop 24/7.

Grab yourself a nice Bluetooth controller and you've got quite a bit of (retro) gaming on the go!There are those that complain about the storage, and I'll admit, it's a bit sparse at stock, but with the advent of tiny USB 3.0 thumb drives that nearly sit flush with the port, as well as SD cards, there should be no issues in the long run. I do recommend, however, to download Windows 10 from Microsoft and make a USB installer, wiping the contents of the drive, and then installing fresh. You'll find some quite unnecessary bloatware when you first receive it, and when you're working with a low powered machine like this the last thing you want is unwarranted background tasks eating your resources!Another item I wanted to touch on is the screen. At 14"", 720p is ON THE VERGE of being too low, but it serves its purpose just fine. Had the device incorporated a 1080p display, the added pixels would just bog the integrated graphics down even more along with draining extra battery. This thing is meant to be portable, and the stellar battery life is awesome, so the screen compromise is well worth it. If things are too big, you can adjust the sizes of elements within Windows 10, as well as the zoom level in most browsers.Finally, on the topic of productivity -- mainly the keyboard and trackpad. I was shocked by the quality of the keys at such a low price! While I realize this computer was something like $299 new at launch, even at that price I'd consider this a very nice keyboard/trackpad. I've experienced no missed clicks or keystrokes, nor input delay of any kind!All in all, a super awesome buy if you want something basic and aesthetically pleasing for a GREAT price!

I hope Linksys handles this.The coverage may be slightly better than velop, but I'm not sure, I can say is that you can customize the signal thanks to adjustable antennas.The Linksys application always makes me frustrated. I'm blind and this does not work well with the screen reader. Linksys do not want to correct this, and do not want to listen to us.UpdateAfter using for several days, I would say you do not buy this router, it has serious performance and signal problems.I put this router where the main node, and left everything in place. Unfortunately the secondary node, began to lose the signal terribly. I've done everything to correct this, but I could not solve the problem, the signal does not arrive well from the main node.I have prepared the network to its former status, everything is fine. I regretted buying this router, it does not add anything to the network, just cause problems and interruptions.  I will come back if you find anything new.
",0.04531681580,pc,"Great wireless router, easy to setup.  Bought this to replace an Apple AirPort Extreme that had a USB hard drive connected to it that gave the family access to music, pictures and movies.  The MR8300 looked like the ideal replacement because the specifications said it had USB port for file storage support, great speeds for 4K HD TV and mesh technology. The later was important because was not sure of coverage in our new two story home.  Well got the unit and it does not access support USB hard drive at this time.  Working with tech support they have showed me where on their website it say that the port is not supported YET in the frequently asked questions.  Furthermore, from the sound of it, reading between the lines of how tech. support explains the situation, it may never be supported.How can they sell a product saying it supports something and it doesn’t.... Guess buyer beware.. What is hard to understand, even their on-line manual say the USB port is there for file storage and may require firmware update.  But not that it is not supported YET.... Very disappointing...
",0.24622705680,pc,"I got my Linksys MR8300 router this week.  Setup went well according to the instructions.  Install the mobile app (in my case on an iPhone), attach the router to the cable modem and power it on.  When the purple light appears, run the app and use it to perform the initial configuration.  When setup is complete, the light turns blue and you're good to go.That's great if all you want to perform is basic setup.  But if you want to set up more advanced configuration like disabling the DHCP server (My Mac server is providing DHCP and DNS for my LAN), configuring Wi-Fi channels and other features, it's not that easy.  I couldn't find any way to do this via the mobile app.  After logging in to the web management interface, I found a few more options.  To get at the rest, I had to click on an undocumented ""CA"" link in the lower right corner of the web interface, which makes more options appear.But even with this, certain things don't seem to be possible.  For instance, after telling the router to auto-detect the best Wi-Fi channels, I couldn't find any screen to show me the channels that were actually selected!  If I pull a diagnostic report, it shows me the configuration (""auto"") but not the operational values.Additionally, I would like a bit more in the way of status lights.  There are Ethernet link lights on the back, but the main unit has only a single multicolor LED to indicate overall status (unconfigured, operational, off-line).  A few more lights to indicate link status and activity on the various interfaces would be very welcome here.Finally, I don't like the fact that you can't perform the initial setup without a Linksys account (on their server) and the mobile app.  My older routers all provided default passwords and IP addresses, allowing initial configuration via a web interface.  This one should provide the same basic functionality.Mind you, none of this affects actual performance.  After getting everything configured and running, it seems to work well and do everything I want it to do.  I just wish there would be a truly advanced configuration option so a person like myself (who has designed and programmed high-end routers and switches for a living) could get access to all the information that the router must have, but doesn't present to me.Five stars for the router itself, but only three stars for the setup and management interface.
",0.14291137580,pc,"Absolute great area coverage for whole home wifi. I purchased the unit due to it's Mesh Capabilities. No more using a range extender that requires you to create separate SID broadcasting between your Main Router and the extender.I expected to have to purchase additional access points to get whole home wifi in our 2400 Sq. ft home but ended up that this unit alone was good enough to cover the whole house, even thru walls!!! I even mounted the unit in a closet and it has great signal through out the house. I may go ahead and purchase a couple of the additional access points just so that I can get a better signal on the porch and the additional Acre of land around the house. But for now the signal is sufficient directly around the outside of the house.Did give it 3 stars on the user interface, this is because it required me to use my smart phone to do the initial setup, and I am an old IT professional so would prefer a WEB GUI interface to setup from my laptop.

You can block sites by name, but you're limited to only 10 websites... Come on software developers, you can do better that that! There are a lot of Internet sites that post inappropriate content, but this router can only block 10!

We're not completely ignorant about hardware/software, and we tend to get things done (eventually) with A LOT of cussing and anger.I set this router up in under an hour! I followed the directions in the box and in the app (on my phone). Everything worked the way it should have. The hardest part was going to each device to ensure they were connected to the correct network.At this point in time the only item on the list that has not happened is that after you set up the network via the phone app, Linksys is supposed to send an email to the supplied address to confirm your account. It's been several hours now, and there has been no email. I tried contacting support, and that's been a bit tedious. However, this glitch is not critical enough (to me) to lower my rating.I will update this review, if warranted, in the future. So far, so GREAT!!

With the Viasat router I am paying $9.99 per month for their use (no you can not cancel this) and the WiFi capability is very limited to about 15-20 feet.  I don't understand why Viasat would not build  better WiFi router that they are very capable of doing as they sent out a repair man for over two hours that said he can not fix the range that I would have to buy an extender.

Problems with WiFi are a thing of the past thanks to Linksys MR8300 Mesh WiFi Router, AC2200, MU-MIMO.  If needed I can even buy extenders if I want the WiFi to extend further.  In addition, I called the tech line and they provided fast, friendly, and competent help.
",0.2249432880,pc,"The router itself is great. The set up through the app is fantastic and it was up and running in no time. My house is 2000sqft and this provides adequate coverage for HD video streaming across the house. Since my router must be in one corner of the house and my TV is on the other corner, I will probably buy another node to beef up the signal. But this one node is enough for now.A couple things to know before you buy:1: The USB port on the back does not work for any size or format of hard drive. You can’t use it for cloud storage. This is frustrating because it says on the product page that it does support this feature. The bright side is that the port is “for future expansion”. After some future firmware update, this port should work for storage. There’s no date for this update as of yet.2: Customer service to help explain this to me wasn’t great. I called the numbers on the box and pretty clearly explained that I wanted to know more about this USB port, but I got moved around a lot to people who couldn’t understand. Eventually I got the “future expansion” explanation and that was that.Overall I am very happy. My Apple AirPort Extreme let the ghost out and this is turning out to be a great replacement for you similar features and performance. The app is pleasant to use as well.

The range and performance is great.  The configuation capabilities of the iOS app are robust, and the parental controls have a lot to offer.Within in the router settings, there is a device prioritization setting that allows up to three devices to be prioritized.  What was not explained is the remaining devices NOT on the list are constantly throttled down regardless of demand on the network.  I spent a lot of time on the phone with Comcast trying to figure out the poor performance.  Buried deep in a discussion board, I learned that device prioritization was the culprit.  Once the setting was turned off, the network speeds passed through the mesh network matched the specs of my service.If you are not concerned with device prioritizion, the AC2200 is a great choice.
",0.87348151280,pc,"Before you read the review below, I wanted to briefly detail my small internet/network setup struggles. We moved into a new apartment which has solid concrete walls. It is a 1600 sq ft home with two levels. The modem connection is up stairs in the living room. Our two bedrooms are on the lower level.My main issue has been trying to get a strong and decent signal on the lower level. I tried multiple set ups (large router, mesh router, wifi extenders/repeater, and powerline), but I ultimately ran a wire from the upper level to lower. The main reason for running a wire was that I was only getting a fraction (at the most 200-300Mbps on the download) of my 1gb speed on the lower level.My current setup (update):1. TP-Link Wifi 6 AX6000 (main router on upper level).2. TP-Link Wifi 6 AX6000 (lower level router as access point. Cat7 wire from main router). My second AC4000 5G signals became very unstable. I did not have this issue with my first AC4000. I could not get a AC4000 replacement so I upgraded the lower level router to an AX6000.3. I am still getting download speeds in the 900-950Mbps wired, 500-600Mbps 5G, 40-60 2G.The devices I tried include:1.

WiFi Range Extender - 1200Mbps WiFi Repeater Wireless Signal Booster, 2.4 & 5GHz Dual Band WiFi Extender with Gigabit Ethernet Port, Simple SetupLinksys Tri-Band Mesh Wifi Router for Home (in a two story apartment with solid concrete walls)SetupThe setup was very quick and simple. It took no more than 15 minutes. I decided to broadcast the Wifi signals separately, so I can dictate myself what device connects to which Wifi band. However, the Linksys Smart Wifi does work very well.There were no issues accessing the router from the app or the webpage. More detail settings and configuration are achieved from the webpage access. One thing to note that with this router, you need a node to access the second 5G band.Range and SpeedI have Xfinity 1gb internet connect. The router was placed on the upper level. The wired speed from the modem averaged low 900s Mbps. On the same level the Wifi range and strength was phenomenal. I got strong 2G and 5G signals anywhere on the upper level. Max download speed on my iphone XR Max and laptop was 600Mbps for 5G and 20-30Mbps on 2G. I had no issues with random disconnects or slow downs. However, on the lower, the signal strength was very poor. For the 5G band I was getting on more than 10Mbps, even when I was located under the router. The 2G signal faired a little better at 20-30Mbps.I also used this router with a powerline and it work great. I used powerline and moved this router to the lower level. Modem to powerline (upper level), then powerline (lower level) to router.  Through the powerline, my speed 200Mbps (wired). After connecting the powerline to the router, my wired speed was 170-180Mbps, 5G 120-130Mbps, and 2G 20-30Mbps. However, moving the router to the lower level meant I was sacrificing the Wifi signal on the upper level.Why did I return it-Need to have a node to access the second 5G band.-Wifi could not penetrate to the lower level. However, this is more of an issue with the concrete walls.Would I recommend this router?I would definitely recommend this router based on the following:-Reasonably priced.-Simple and quick setup.-Consistent range and speed (if you have a single level home without concrete walls).
",0.581,pc,"I was looking for a low end tablet for my kids mainly so they could watch videos and play some basic games on it. I knew I didn't need a ton of horse power on it, and the price had to be cheap.This tablet for the bill. It was cheap, small and portable, and it already comes with Android 8 plus a bunch of kids games pre installed on it. The carrying case it came with is sturdy, so I'm not worried about my son or daughter dropping it. For the most part I can tell it has a pretty stock version of Android installed. So I could install apps from the play store easily. For my use cases, the tablet was surprisingly useable. I thought the performance would be horrible, but given the price point it's actually pretty good. Its not your high end tablet snappy, but this is better than my fire 8, which sometimes has trouble switching apps and scrolling.If you are looking for a cheap tablet for your kids, I would recommend this one.

The Looney Tunes Phonics game is one of them and it’s excellent at teaching letters and the sounds they make. My son is around the age of learning letters and sounds so we’ve used this a few times and will continue to. A few apps he personally likes to play are ABC world, Game kids 5 and body parts for kids. (All are preinstalled on the tablet).Another great thing about this tablet is the parental controls. I honestly had to unblock a few things when I first got the tablet because so many things were blocked. The “kids corner” app is where all of the apps you want your child to use can be put into. This app is password protected so you can’t get out of it unless you use a password, so no worrying about your child getting into other things on the tablet that you don’t want them to use. You can also set a timer for how long you want your child to be on the tablet.The operating system is ok, it runs on Android 8, it’s not the fastest thing in the world so it takes patience for some of the things to load and the touch screen can be finicky at times but he’s able to play games ok. I’m not sure if I got a bad one or not but the charging cord and port are loose so I’m not sure how long the charger is going to last.  The tablet can also get a little warm at times but all and all it’s a nice basic tablet.Updated 11/1/19: I have revised my review from 4 stars to 5 stars because of the excellent customer service I received about the loose charger (which actually did end up breaking after my initial review) .

The ports themselves are all Thunderbolt 3 spec’ed and thus can all carry massive amounts of data back and forth, allowing a display, mouse, keyboard, and power to all go through a single USB-C port. However, the MacBooks take that just a little too far by neglecting to include any USB-A ports, making backwards compatibility impossible without an associated dongle. And hell if Apple is going to charge me $50 for a single USB-A to USB-C dongle.Enter the HooToo USB-C dongle. Yes, it’s still a dongle, but it includes just so much for the money. In terms of design, you get a space grey finish very similar to the finish that Apple touts on their MacBooks and prior generation iPhones. Were it not for the glowing HooToo logo emblazoned across the front of the device, you might be fooled into thinking that this could be created by Apple. The aluminum casing is a unibody design with a plastic base. The entire thing just feels study and solid with no creaks anywhere. Even the USB-C head itself is attached by a thick, sturdy feeling wire.In terms of functionality, it’s really plug and play. All of the ports work as intended, the USB-C port allows for PD through to my 13 inch MacBook Pro, and the HDMI port puts out 1080p 60 hz without any difficulties. However, it does drop down to one 30 hz when outputting to 4k which I thought was a shame. USB accessories all work as intended when you plug them in, including mice and keyboard.There’s very little else to say about this hub other than that it does its job, it’s built well, and it’s inexpensive compared to a lot of other options out there. This is one of those products where the less you notice it, the better it is. And thus far, it’s been quietly doing it’s job on my desk without a second thought.
",0.584,pc,"With a lot of newer laptops, the USB port has changed from 3.1 to USB c. This hub comes in very handy. I work in IT and use it when I want to connect to a monitor and ethernet at the same time. It was very easy to install and work with. I do wish it came with another video port but I knew what I was buying so it does live up to the advertisement and does work perfectly.
",0.7745531884,pc,"What a great adapter hub!Having only 2 usb-c ports on my MacBook was always a bit limiting without the proper adapters, but this solves that problem by combining all your adapter needs into one!To start out, my traditional use case is at my desk. Where I have my monitor, mouse, keyboard, ethernet all hooked up to this adapter connected to my macbook. I have tested both the SD card slot and the microsd card slot (I love that this slot is included!) and both were able to hit the rated speeds of my U3 sd card so there was no issue there. I also tested the ethernet speeds and I was able to max out my bandwidth at 400mb~, so I do believe HooToo when they say it is rated for 1gbps!  This adapter worked for both macOS and worked when I ran windows in bootcamp as well!I also love the attention to detail in terms of the color of the shell, perfectly matching my space gray macbook!I know not everyone is a fan of the white light LED, but I like it, I just wish apple kept the white light up logo! Perhaps in a future revision maybe there can be a toggle on the bottom of the device to turn off the LED?The unit does get a bit hot (as written on the warning label). I feel this is when you use this adapter to charge your device(s). Being the paranoid person that I am, if I know I will be using my laptop for extended periods, I think I will plug my power cable into my laptop directly, and this adapter into the other port.I do wish that this adapter had DisplayPort either in addition or instead of HDMI, I have a 165HZ 1440p monitor and that is just something that HDMI can't support. It will do 1440p @ 60fps though! which is fine for the type of work I use my laptop for.Overall great adapter. Light enough to travel with, but handy enough for a full desktop experience as well.
",0.82841181884,pc,"With the current push of laptops supporting USB-C, buying into the Apple ecosystem like I do comes with a lot of compatibility problems. The most common one is ""dongle hell"" -- this is where you often end up with several different adapters (""dongles"") to plug in different accessories which you used to be able to do with just simple USB but now have to decide whether to throw out all the old accessories and buy new ones or to look for different adapters for each thing.What this can look like is pretty much one adapter for your SD card, another for your USB-A devices, another for gigabit ethernet, and a fourth for plugging in an external monitor.I don't know about you, but the idea of having to constantly plug in four things and then unplug them whenever I want to take my laptop somewhere else straight-up gives me anxiety. It's an impractical setup which can lead to frustration. With that in mind, I'm really glad that companies are taking note and driving down the cost of USB-C hubs these days. I remember when the first USB-C Macbook came out and the only adapter was double the price of this HooToo hub and offered only two ports compared with this one's eight.This hub lets you hook up all of your old stuff to your new stuff in a quick and simple fashion. Instead of having to buy four separate adapters for your different accessories and hoping that you remember to have all of them, you can consolidate all of it into one single hub which then plugs into a single slot on your Macbook. This is a game changer -- it especially helps me quickly pull things off my laptop and go when I'm rushing over to the next meeting in my office.It's also a great travel companion. Being portable, I can toss this in my bag and plug in whenever I'm at a hotel with faster ethernet speeds than wifi and also uplaod photos from my digital camera with its built-in card reader.The HooToo Hub comes with eight ports: Two USB 3.0, one USB 2.0, an SD, TF (Micro SD), Gigabit Ethernet, 4K HDMI, and a USB-C power input port. That's a lot of ports and for my own purposes I found all but the TF port to be useful.Transferring large movie files via USB was quick and the SD card reader never failed to mount my SD card when plugged in. It drove a 27"" 4K display through HDMI without stuttering or flickering at 30hz, and delivered lightning fast internet speeds through the ethernet port. I wasn't able to test the TF port due to me not having any cards of that size at this time, nor was I able to test this on a tablet like an iPad -- this was plugged into my Macbook Pro the entire time.Some improvements this product could have are driving 4K displays at 60hz along with a second HDMI or DisplayPort for a dual-display setup. Additionally, the Space Gray color is slightly darker from the one that Apple uses for its MBPs, but I actually wish that the MBP were darker in that regard.Overall, I really like owning this device. Its functionality so far has been excellent for my use cases. At this price point it was a no-brainer and I'm glad that I made the purchase.
",0.78482186884,pc,"I use my Macbook at home and at work, so I like to have a USB-C hub at each location, connected to my monitors and keyboard/mouse. When I go from work to home, I simply unplug from my hub at home, then plug into my hub at work when I arrive.This HooToo hub works very well. The power throughput is great, allowing me to charge my laptop as fast as it would without a hub. I have a 4k monitor plugged into the HDMI port and have had no issues with getting proper video display through the hub.The HooToo logo lights up when the hub is plugged in and stays on, even when the computer is powered off.
",0.75506067384,pc," It's not often these days that you get what you pay for. It's even less often that you get more than you pay for. I've even made a handy dandy video (attached) that shows you the unboxing and initial connection.I'll say this. I have a high end thunderbolt 3 dock at work for my MacBook Pro (I do a lot of video and motion graphic design) and it's really no better (from what I can see) than this item. I have quite a few HooToo branded products and they all tend to be well made and highly functional.First off, it's aesthetically pleasing to the eye. It matches up with my Space Grey MBPro just dandy. In addition, there's a cool little lightup feature when you connect it to your system. Slick!As far as operation of it, it works like a charm. I've got my original power adapter going into the 100 watt power delivery port, an HDMI output to a 1080P monitor. One USB 3 port has a portable drive connected and the other has a hub with 4 ports connected. The microSD slot works quite well and as quick as advertised. I have a Blue Nessie microphone plugged into the USB 2 port as well. This sucker just works!I did have to download something to make the ethernet port work properly, but it didn't take long and it's probably because I'm running the MacOS beta right now.It's all running like a top.
",0.96109545284,pc,"Yup, that is right!  I go this hub to use as a second docking station for when I bring my work laptop computer home.  It is simple enough to have the printer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and even Ethernet, all plugged in so that all I need to do when I get home is plug the one USB C hub into my laptop and start working.  The included User's Manual (it's nice that they still include a printed manual so one does not need to go to the manufacturer's Web site and search for a PDF manual) lists supported operating systems to be Windows / Mac / Unix / Chromebook, but in a note, suggests that it may not work on earlier OS versions like Linux.  Well, I tried, and it does work just fine on Debian Linux running on a Dell laptop.  Not only that, but when plugging it into my old LG Android cell phone, I now have a physical keyboard, mouse, USB memory drives, SD cards, etc, on my cell phone.  This is absolutely fantastic!This little hub has opened up so much functionality on my phone, making it a replacement for a full computer when in a pinch, and has made transferring files between computer and phone quick and simple.  I now have a full workstation at home, or on the go.  I love it!
",0.85163950984,pc,"This adapter is really nice and I love it. The type of material used and the finishing is perfectly matching with the Space Grey MacBook Pro I have. It made my life easier. The feeling is just great and I recommend MacBook users to get one.

It helps save space at home and it's convenient for traveling. Although, I am not sure how some of these ports will hold up in the future, they are adequate for now. Technology seems to advance so fast and if you're not paying attention, it will pass you by. I really like the multiple usb connectors and are more useful with people who have multiple usb devices. It's perfect someone traveling with their laptop and you need both a keyboard and mouse to make you feel at home. I am especially pleased with the rj45 connector. I can now easily connect my laptop for a high speed connection. Wifi can sometimes be slow but we still don't have 5G yet. When 5G comes out, that port will be worthless. I have not tried the other ports but I am sure they work fine. Will update once I test every port. Great product. Very compact. Travel friendly. I recommend it.

It already happened to me in the past to buy a tablet and then be limited by a modified Android system that would hardly let me uninstall and install anything because I didn't have the Google Store.With the Google Store you have the doors open to be able to install what you want, I chose to create an account for my son with the Google Family Link and thus be able to control the times and permissions of all the applications that I will use, even remotely disconnecting the tablet whenever you want and set time limits, etc.It also has a micro SD card reader and as a curiosity is that, apart from being compatible with micro USB charging it can also be charged with another type of traditional charger as an extra.

You can set up various parental options, and if you don't think you can figure it out, I suggest you go with a more locked down option.  It seems pretty durable.

But still, I couldn't look at my MacBook Pro retina screen and then look at this monitor. I obviously knew it wouldn't be nearly as good, but it actually gave me a headache looking at the pixelated text. I ended up sending it back and going for the HP Q27 (it was on sale at Best Buy for the same price as the sceptre). Night and day difference!

",0.12258270488,pc,"I got a decent bonus at work, and I knew I wanted 2 things for my home office. A great printer, and a decent monitor (as I've been using a spare 40"" 1080p led TV for the past 4 years).  My budget was 100-250, and needed to be high refresh (more than 75 hz) over hdmi (I have a couple year old HP Omen 17 laptop, and it only has a 1050 ti with hdmi 2.0 output... No dp) 27"" or more, 1080p - 1440p, and curved if possible. I also wanted a freesync monitor (as nvidia enabled g-sync over freesync), knowing I couldn't afford an official g-sync monitor. Little did I know that I cannot enable g-sync over hdmi with this particular laptop regardless, but I digress.  This monitor checked ALL of these boxes, and at a considerable discount compared to all the other options available to me in this price point. I could get most checked with other monitors in the sub 250 price point, but everyone had a tradeoff that ranges from annoyance, to full-on deal-breaker.  I was reluctant, as I have 0 experience with the Septre brand. I just figured I could send it back if I didn't like it, and save up for one that really hits all of the marks (for more than $300). Boy, am I glad I picked this up.  So... This isn't going to compare to a color calabrated, high-end display. I've certainly used much ""nicer"" monitors in the past, mostly at work, that offered much more in the way of picture & features. If you want great sRGB coverage, super high resolution, nice tilt-lift function, crazy wide viewing angles, HDR, ect... This is not the monitor for you.  If you want a balls to the wall, immersive, gaming experience at half the cost of the closest competitor... Buy this monitor. If you are using a TV as your monitor, and you want a cheep way to get a taste of the good stuff... Buy this monitor.  I plugged in the high speed hdmi cable, cranked the refresh to 144hz, and immediately noticed a huge improvement in fps and rts games. Smoother, faster,  and more immersive than the 40"" TV I was using. This monitor looks great! It doesn't feel super cheep either. The stand leaves little to be desired, but it's adequate (ntm doesn't look like a big oval office stand, so points for that I guess).  It's not very bright, and text isn't as super sharp as I was expecting. This does kinda suck as I do a fair amount of writing and spreadsheet work on my computer, but I'm willing to give up a little for the killer gaming experience.  To sum it up, I do not regret this purchase. I'm good with the small bad things, because the good things are pretty great. My gaming rig feels complete now. Some day I will spend the extra money, and get a crazy 1440p 32"" ultra-wide or something. This will do just fine until that day. My 1050 ti can't handle that any way.

Also for some reason, the USB  ports are only on the left and the power plug is quite loose and comes out very easily if used while it is plugged in. Otherwise, I am extremely happy with this laptop and have found it to be a great machine!
",0.83621078789,pc,"This is a nice laptop. Sleek looking and performs reasonably well. But for the price, I expected more. I'm also using a Dell laptop. I'm also using a Dell laptop that costs about half as much. It has a larger screen, a better picture, a larger keyboard, a built-in CD/DVD drive, and seems to perform at least as well. Microsoft adds a touch-screen that is rarely used.Either spend less to get a machine that is as good. Or spend the same to get a machine that is far better.
",0.97856342890,pc,"I've only had this little Chromebook for a few days, but I can already tell you it's exactly what I was looking for. I was a little reserved about ordering after reading other reviews, and the fact that it is a refurbished laptop. Please allow me to dispel some of your concerns, or perhaps clarify some of the information out there. This is a CHROMEBOOK. If you are expecting Windows functionality or Apple OS, you will be disappointed. It runs the Google OS, a special Chome-based operating system that is lightweight and efficient. It's perfect for cruising the internet, email, pictures, youtube, music, etc. You can open and edit all your MS Office documents through Google Apps. You've got plenty of storage space via Google Drive. You can even download and install some very  convenient apps through the Google Play Android store - very cool. Screen resolution is great. Speed through webpages on the internet is great. Battery life has been great. The fact that it converts into a tablet is very useful and the touchscreen seems quite responsive. There are several reviews out there about the mouse/touchpad being bad - I think those people need to get over it. This is roughly a $200 Chromebook, what do you expect Acer to manufacture? It gets the job done. I haven't had any issues with it being a refurbished unit; no signs of wear, everything came in plastic.So before you purchase this unit, please remember that this is a CHROMEBOOK. It runs Google OS. If you expecting a laptop with Windows and Apple OS functionality, or if you need to run programs that require those specific OS', then don't buy this and leave bad reviews. But if you need a basic laptop with a great screen, some cool features, that is fast, light and secure, then this is the one for you.
",0.83335578490,pc,"Refurbished R11 is a good value, but it isn't perfect.  Mine had zero cosmetic blemishes or handling marks when it arrived.  It even had some of the thin cellophane cover that you seen on digital devices such as phones and laptops.  For all intents and purposes, it is unused.  Maybe it was a returned item.  Anyway the savings of $60 was much appreciated.  I have two complaints.  Both are not deal breakers.  This chromebook won't charge past about 90-92% no matter how long I leave it charging.  It's strange.  Also, it requires a little more effort than I expected to tap and double tap in table mode.  I do have one tip:  Be sure to upgrade the Chrome OS to the latest version right away, before you install Play Store and apps.  All in all, I do recommend this Chromebook.
",0.20605757890,pc,"Four months ago, and the first time buying refurbished, I give this Chromebook and the seller 5 stars, right off the top. My very first Chromebook arrived securely packaged properly for protection. I could tell no difference between this and a brand new item, no signs of any use whatsoever. The matching power adapter was wrapped, sealed in factory-like condition The hinges still had the protective plastic as well.  It booted up right away, and then I went ahead and charged it fully. Since I cannot make comparisons to  other books or tablets, I am still savvy and computer literate enough with to know that this is a superior book, quality and performance-wise.This comes loaded with enough software and applications to get you started. The apps for for document and spreadsheet processing are included, and I've since added the Google Sheets editing option, which blurs the difference between Microsoft and Google software. The system walks the user through the setup, which was especially helpful since I had not owned either a tablet or Chromebook. Though it has 3 position options, I bought this to replace my Lenovo with Windows 7 laptop. and I keep the traditional laptop layout (keyboard flat down + screen open 90 degrees) I had to learn the hard way that my existing laptop still needed to be on and connected to the network, in order to use a ""non-cloud ready"" printer from anywhere in the world.  These days, newer printers come ""cloud ready"", but my treasured and expensive HP LaserJet could still be utilized with this workaround  Wow, I sound pretty smart, don't I?  Only because it took me hours and hours of troubleshooting and searching for support. So, even though the transition was almost seamless, expect a period of adjustment, trial and error and a lot of Google searches. The web seems to think the most basic processes are common knowledge by all, which presents challenges for us a little late to the game.Aside from the minor learning curve, the Chromebook is very peppy and has never crashed, shut down or off, or met anything where it could not perform as intended. It beats my expensive, i8 processor, W7 laptop easily. I've had > 20 tabs open, and multiple instances of open apps I forgot about, the Download or ""explorer"" window all running at the same time. By using shortcut keys I've come to rely on, almost all of them can still be used with the same results here. The.ability to add apps or extensions (another newbie for me), makes Google Docs and Sheets a very short learning curve for Microsoft Office users.  They are basically alike, though formula translation hasn't been mastered yet, so keep your original Excel sheets saved. But, I don't miss Excel or Word since tools exist for a seamless transition. It provides the ability to convert documents back to Microsoft's if it needs to end up that way when finalized. So, for the last four months, this Acer has performed flawlessly; enough that I completely forgot to post a review until now. This purchase has been a pleasant surprise, over and above my expectations. I'm glad I chose this model, and from this seller. No regrets, just very happy computing and easy integration into my life. I love my new book!

This is my first experience with chrome is, I have been a Linux Ubuntu, mint and fedora user for the last 15 years. This Chromebook book is quick is response to all tasks given, the ui is nice and simple, while looking good and remaining fuctional. I love that this device doubles as a large tablet. The SD card slot is nice as 32gb is not quite enough for my use. I bought this for use while traveling and for goofing off, and have instead replaced my lenove edge running Ubuntu as my everyday device. I like that it works seamlessly with my  Android phone, any pictures are document, etc  created  ony phone can be found on my chromebook immediately, love this.I would recommend this device to almost anyone from kids to grandparents!
",0.9536662190,pc,"This is a convertible (laptop that can fold into a tablet) touchscreen Chromebook (a laptop that runs a stripped down Linux-based operating system oriented towards web browsing.) Having used other Chromebooks before, here's the pros and cons:Pros:- Very solid unit, light and compact without being too small- Keyboard feels good, not perfect but good for a machine of this type- Decent amount of storage and the minimum amount of memory I think's acceptable (you'd be amazed how many Chromebooks come with 2Gb of RAM)- Screen has good contrast- Runs Android apps. In some ways it's a better Android tablet than an Android tablet. Integration is good.- Convertible functionality works great except for the inherent problems with the touchscreen (see below)Cons:- Touch screen is buggy. Short taps are often either mostly ignored (a button's border might change but without any action taking place) or treated as a long press.- It's slow. Playing a full screen YouTube video if there's another tab open will frequently result in lots of stuttering. Scrolling is often slightly jerky. The Celeron CPU used by this machine is reportedly more closely related to the older Atom series of CPUs than the Core CPUs that recent Celerons are usually associated with, and unfortunately it shows (I thought it wouldn't as it's effectively a ""High end Atom"", but...)- The case is stippled white plasic. So it already looks dirty before it gets a drop of dirt on it, and you know it's going to attract dirt, grime, and other gunk over time. I honestly think it's a little ugly.Over all, it's a nice system in general, but I suspect the cons listed above will be an irritation to most users. Hopefully Acer will fix them in the next model.
",0.83157002990,pc,"I bought two of these - one for each of my siblings. They don't do any major computing so Chromebooks seemed like the perfect fit for them. These ended up being the perfect gifts. They love them. When I set them up for them I noticed that they were well put together and had excellent quality. I didn't notice any scratches or marks considering they were refurbished. I was able to purchase insurance on them for 2 or 3 years and the price came out to the same as if I had purchased new ones. I did a lot of research and the 32gb memory with 4gb RAM was the best option for a Chromebook considering you have to place your programs on the onboard memory.

Does not recognize either finger on screen or arrow when used or clicked from the pad. It has a mind of its own, possessed, and wanted to drive me crazy. I was on the way, but decided to sent it back to the asylum instead. This thing is totally unusable in its current state. Would not recognize my email address; would not allow me to set my local network (no WPS recognition) because it asked for a password only. Perhaps being a reconditioned item, it made it out the door looking like it works, but not so when you try to use it for anything. On boot up, looks pretty, but Google Chrome goes down hill fast - and  you need Chrome to do anything. I use Chrome exclusively as a browser on my Windows 'puters, so it isn't me imagining something.

",0.02486991990,pc,"I really like this Chromebook. I should say that this is my first experience with a Chromebook, so it has taken some getting used to. I'm not a fan of the printing. I wouldn't knock a star off for it though, because it's a personal preference due to what I am used to with microsoft products. The options for how to print are different and vary. Example would be that I cant use powerpoint and make it so my powerpoint lecture notes will print 3 slides to one page. I only have the option really to print double sided. Also when trying to print from the internet, it wont let me print ""fitted to page"" at times. I know this is likely an operator error. So take it with a grain of salt. Battery life is great. I take it with me to school and it keeps up nicely, unlike my Lenovo laptop that I may as well have plugged in 24/7. I have noticed it will last a few days if I am only using it on and off (without the need of shutting it off completely). If I am on it for hours straight to do school work it lasts 8 hours. Could last up to 10 depending on what you are doing. I use it for looking up information and watching a lot of lectures. Also for doing math homework on mymathlab.com.  Hope this helps
",0.21265500891,pc,"Pros:• USB-C, Finally! As a past Surface Pro user, this was never a feature. With a USB-C, like any computer, you can do so much more with this device now. From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.• It’s a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.• It’s light. Not IPad light, but enough that you won’t feel worried that you’re not going to bend it.• The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.• Cortana listens to you pretty well. I’m learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.• Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.• Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when it’s placed on my lap.• microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)• Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if you’re planning to edit videos on this.• Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and• Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don’t expect the same results when using an off-brand.• A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.• The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.• The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it’s quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.• I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.Cons and Oks:• The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can’t be ignored in 2019. It’s very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).• With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.• Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it’ll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.• The battery life isn’t great. I’m getting around 8 hours of power. That’s having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it’s nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.• Don’t take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.• Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn’t test these as you only get the tablet.• Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we’re already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.• I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn’t for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.Bottom Line:If you’re going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It’s disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you’re pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can’t attach them to the Surface Pro.Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less.  I have the previous model on hand and I can’t tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I’m also irritated that Microsoft didn’t at least try to improve the design.But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you’ll know that Microsoft put all their money on what’s inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that’s the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I’m always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can’t do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you’re getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer
",0.591,pc,"I'm seeing complaints about how this isn't a major redesign of the Pro 6. That may be true, but the internals are where it's at. I mean, I love this thing. It's like having a decently powerful desktop PC in the form factor of a tablet, which can quickly become a laptop. For instance, I installed an Xbox Game Pass game (Ori and the Blind Forest) and it ran amazingly smooth; I had no idea a 12 inch tablet could run a game with Xbox One-quality graphics even in 2019. Sure, it's not gonna run Gears 5 in 4K, but how many tablets can say they can run even a game like Ori at decent settings?People keep saying ""it's just like the Pro 6 but with a USB-C connector!"" But it's been confirmed by multiple sources that the Pro 7's i5 processor is better than the Pro 6's i7 processor. And yeah, having a USB-C connector is pretty nice.Yes, the bezels are slightly thicker than most 2019 phones and tablets, but it's a non-issue for me. I use the Surface in tablet mode and it would be incredibly annoying to accidentally touch things on the screen because there's nowhere to put my hands for the sake of A E S T H E T I C S. It's a silly complaint, in my opinion.I'm a grad student, so I need to be able to plop down anywhere -- the library, a cafe, my mom's house, a friend's house, wherever -- and get work done in a way that my phone simply isn't right for. But I also want to be able to stream movies, edit videos, play videogames, and so on. So far, the Surface Pro 7 has done everything I want and more.Literally the only bummer is that Microsoft STILL isn't bundling the type cover in with the tablet. Springing an extra $150 for something that feels like an essential part of the package is a huge bummer. I wish they could figure out a way to include the type cover, even if they have to make some compromises.

The XPS FHD with 32GB RAM came in at $1730. I would like to see a 32GB 4K 512GB option since I don't need that much on-device storage.All have performance improvements over their predecessors thanks to the new 10th gen Intel i7 processors, LPDDR4x RAM and WiFi 6. The Surface Book 2 is too dated to compare here and is clunkier.It's a toss up between the XPS for its 32GB RAM with taller screen, or the Yoga with its USB-A port, better keyboard, and garaged pen, among other things. The extra RAM comes in useful since the integrated graphics will use some of that. The 16GB models easily ran up to 80% CPU, RAM and GPU when driving 2 external monitors and simultaneously running Chrome with 10 tabs, Office apps, iTunes and light gaming. It often sits at 8GB RAM under normal use.Some may appreciate all the ports being on one side as with the Yoga, or having ports on either side as with the XPS. The  volume rocker on the SP7 comes in handy. The lighter weight of the SP7 made it the first to be grabbed on the go. The proprietary surface connect plug is not easy to plug in when the SP7 is flat on the table, especially when the type cover is on in closed position. Also, the plug falls off too easily especially since the cable only goes in one direction. When the SP7 is flat on the desk I would plug it in with the cable coming from the top, but would need to flip the plug if I open up the Pro. I wish MS went with USB-C power delivery and slimmer bezels. The perfect laptop is not quite here yet.

Technology has come so far...I've had an Apple iPad for years...it's not new (so old, in fact, that I can't remember what version or what size it is).  I certainly expected this brand-new tech to beat that old iPad.This has a lovely picture, but it has a lot of dead-space around the edge.  I have no idea why we should have so much dead space around the edge of a screen.  I get it that some is normal, but this is almost an inch all around.The ability to flip from landscape to portrait views is painfully slow.The touch screen is very slow, and sometimes doesn't notice my touch at all.I have had repeated incidents of the tablet not noticing that I need a keyboard.

",0.97619652792,pc," I tend to be generous with my Star Ratings, and can't deny this is a solidly built, well-made Model with good specs for the price. It has an actual headphone Out. Clean Android Pie 9.0 with no Bloatware. Customer Service is US Based and prompt to a Phone Call (eventho they were just as baffled as I about this problem and were unable to help). So I give it 3 Stars.However, I am returning it for Credit since this Tablet has a fatal problem with FB Messenger, and that is very much a deal-killer for me. It could be because Amazon is currently in possession of a bad Batch of Product, but no Item that has earned an ""Amazon's Choice"" badge should behave like this.Essentially, the original Item I received had the FB Messenger Homepage doing a non-stop 360 as soon as you Click and open it. Which is mighty weird, because other Apps I installed (including the main Facebook App) run perfectly fine. Which means it cannot be an onboard stabilizer or gyro issue. And there is no way to Exit the troublesome App once it starts revolving. The onscreen switches become unresponsive and one has to hard Restart (long-pressing the Power button 10+ seconds).Ordered a Replacement (Amazon excellent in this, arrived the next day). And voila! Same damn issue! Feast your eyes on the madness from the video I took with both the Original and Replacement, side-by-side.Not sure what other Apps do this weird act on this Tablet since I didn't install many (for example, I'm not sure if another Messenger List based app like WhatsApp or Snapchat will do this too).So Caveat Emptor.

They are fine if your just watching videos if your listening to music I would use headphones or a blue tooth speaker.The tablet feels like a quality product. It does not feel cheap.Youtube videos on here look nice and are sharp looking. Everything loads up quick. I was able to test out some games on this tablet. The games I ran were Grand Theft Auto 3 on high and it ran fine. It had zero stutters. The second game I ran was Riptide GP the first one and everything on high and again it was running very good. The next game was NFS most wanted on high and I had zero stutters. I also tested out Crazy Taxi on here and it was as smooth as silk. These are all older titles but they are all in 3d. So it does test out the graphics card in this tablet.I do wish the tablet was lighter but that is just a slight nit pick. The screen is great looking and its very bright looking as well. This device would be perfect for emulation. PSP, Playstation one and maybe even the dreamcast emulator. I will be testing these out later.

",0.10693451892,pc,"I bought this tablet after trying another budget tablet (a name brand at $100, 1GB Ram, Quad Core processor, Android 9.0, 1200x800). I was not satisfied with it. It was super plasticky, would freeze and hiccup, the interface animations were jerky, and the resolution wasn't great.This one is far superior in the budget tablet space in all ways, and well worth going up to the $120-140 range.Construction pros: metal body, solid, the buttons do not feel plasticky. Premium feel. Comparable in hand to a Galaxy Tab or Amazon Fire. Much superior to other budget Android Tablets at this price point. Construction cons: the snap-off panel that holds the SD and SIM cards seems thin and brittle. The screen came with a stick-on protective film that I have not removed. So far, it has held up, but I imagine it will be a ""replace from time to time"" component that protects the underlying glass.Screen is FANTASTIC at 1920x1200. The IPS panel allows for viewing in a wide range of angles. Would like better range of brightness settings.Touch interaction is superb. Taps and clicks register well, and the OS animations are silky smooth.Battery life is fine--watching streaming video, I got 4+hrs and had 30% left. But I didn't do any sort of sophisticated rundown test.Bluetooth worked just fine--I had a BT keyboard, BT mouse, BT headphones all working simultaneously.Hooked up to wifi just fine, too.By default, it's set to make a lot of sounds/provide haptic feedback. I was able to turn off most of them, but it still surprises me with really loud chimes every once in a while--just can't find where to shut those off, although I imagine this is an Android OS and operator incompetence issue, not the fault of the product per se. But out of the box, it's noisy by default. Not taking any stars away because of it.Performance: The main reason I replaced my other Android tablet with this one was performance. For a similar price point ($126 for this with a coupon versus $100 for a different tablet), you get double the RAM (2GB) ram and an octa-core processor. I don't know the specifics of the processor here, and you can be sure that it is a budget component.  But unlike my other budget Android 9.0 tablet, the processing on this is more than enough for running the Android 9.0 operating system and providing browsing, e-mailing, and streaming interaction. Which is what I use it for.I watched an online video review on Youtube before making this purchase. The reviewer showed the results of a processor speed test--it was not BLAZING fast, but it was sufficient to run Android 9. And the review showed 30 seconds of an intense driving game with only a couple of frame hiccups.
",0.84408384692,pc,"The size of this tablet is perfect. It is large enough to do many things on, but still small enough to easily fit in my purse. The screen is clear and vibrant. Startup and set up was a breeze. It was super easy to sync with my desktop and phone accounts.  The sound is decent. I am getting a bluetooth keyboard to go with this to make working on the road much easier. This is one of the easiest tablets to configure to my wants. it has plenty of power to run the programs I use and the battery lasts for several days before needed to be recharged. I purchased the case Amazon recommend as well. I am posting a review of that we well.

So far after 2 weeks battery has lasted all day. Much faster and smooth than the Vankyo Z10 which I am sending back. Easy to set up. This is the best budget tablet out here in this price range. Speakers sound ok but are not very loud. They are fine for watching you tube vids or Facebook ECT. But if watching movies or listing to Pandora or Spotify, you will need a blue tooth speaker, which you most likely would for any tablet. The Bluetooth does work well and has good range. The camera is the negative here. Works for scanning or a quick pic but it basically sucks. So keep thatnin mind. However, who buys a tablet for premium sound or a premium camera. Overall, I am highly satisfied with this tablet. Especially for only $134.

I will say the picture quality isn’t the best but that’s the only con I can think of. I don’t use it for pictures anyway... so no loss there.

The trackpad is also very good. The screen seems very good to me with plenty of brightness and good resolution for internet browsing, documents, photos, spreadsheets, and the like. I like that the Go is a bit smaller and lighter than the Pixelbook. It feels very solid to me, more so than the Pixelbook. It's a keeper for me. I have the cheapest version with the M3 processor and it seems perfectly fine for general use. I haven't run into any slowdowns yet, but I also don't do any gaming or video editing, just general internet use.
",0.89314186693,pc,"Brilliant laptop! The build quality is top notch and everything from the keyboard and track pad to the full HD screen is a very pleasant and premium experience.  I got the base model and I think for most people that's all you need unless you need more storage. Chrome OS is lightweight already, so the laptop has absolutely zero performance issues with it's configuration.  The battery is stellar, I'm getting nearly 12 hours before having to charge, and it has fast-charging capabilities when you do have to.  The only limitations are Chrome OS, which isn't a problem for me since I'm only using things like google docs and sheets for school. If you need programs for heavy photo or video editing or if you're planning to play anything more intense than an android game than this laptop isn't for you. But if you need a beautiful, fast and simple OS that allows you to answer emails, write a few documents and watch some Netflix with ease than look no further than this machine.
",0.06636297793,pc,"Great piece of hardware here. The entire outside is a lightweight metal that reminds me of magnesium, but I might be wrong. From pictures, I assumed that the ridged underside would be a glued-on rubber pad. Not the case. That' seems to be the same metal as the rest of the body. There are 2 rubber ""strips"" at the front and back to provide some grip, but most of the underside is metal (Good for heat dissipation, really neat design there).Thin laptops often have flimsy screens. When you go laptop shopping, test the screen for ""flex"". I don't like flex in my screens, and this passes with flying colors.The keyboard feels great. The trackpad is very responsive and works well. The click of the trackpad is a little on the loud side for my taste-- I wish it had been haptic feedback similar to the macbook pro.F keys are tricky. You can hold down the ""application"" button (where the caps lock lives) and use the top row as F1-F10. Need F11-F12? It's nowhere I could find on the support site. I had to start up a support chat to find that using the same application button combo, use the number keys F1-0 (F1-10) and then - = for F11 and 12. This works, but I don't like how hard I had to look to track down the info. I know that you can treat the top row as F keys by default as well, with the flip of a toggle in the settings.Chrome OS is good. I think it will get better. I'd like to see more of the trackpad gestures I learned to love on Macbooks. Three-finger-swipe to see virtual desktops would be a great start.
",0.24630314193,pc,"Let’s be honest, a laptop is a laptop, at the end of the day not much to them except screen, looks and how it all is put together.  I have a windows pc for gaming, but when I want an easy to use all arounder I love using chromebooks.  I have a pixel slate but wanted a regular laptop for school work to take with me anywhere I am going to go.  Rather than go over another typical laptop review I mean there is really nothing I can add except tell you why I choose it over the competition.What I want in a laptop:  looks, good battery life, good keyboard, nice display, thin/light, reliable, good price and decent performance.The go versus:Asus 425/433/434:  these are probably the biggest competition in price, looks and performance,  The issue with the 434 is the lack of reliability with numerous reports for users. At 3.2 lbs it is kinda heavy, and the 433 has a cheap keyboard deckHp/Dell 14 inch:  I put these both together because they are similar and they both are very heavy approaching closer to 4 lbs.  To give you an idea my 15.6 gaming laptop weighs 4.8 lbs. The dell is not very attractive to me and more bland.  The HP is attractive but still heavy, not a bad choice, but not the best option IMO.Acer Spin 13:  very premium,  but more of an industrial design, also heavy, great performance though.  UHD display.Pixelbook:  probably the best alternative, and checks a lot of boxes but I find the large bezels very dated. Still expensive if you want to buy it new.Samsung plus V2:  another good alternative with a metal lid.  Under 3 lbs and not bad looking.  The bottom portion is plastic and it does feel like it.  Plain 1080p panel.The pixelbook go has a good 1080p panel which you don’t find often in chromebooks unfortunately.  Outside of the pixelbook the go is the only other one under 2.5 lbs.  It is also thin.  Slim side bezels.  Great speakers and keyboard.  The go checks all my boxes for a laptop perfect for this my masters program.When I first heard the go announced I was upset in the pricing, but then I compared it to the competition.  At regular price almost all the competition sells at $599.  The base pixelbook go that I bought is $649.  The go is $50 dollars more but compared to the rivals it has a leg up on build quality and looks with many of them.  Now most of the other laptops I mention they have been on sale for significantly lower than msrp so you might want to consider that.  There also is no fold-able display like many of the others, which for me has less meaning for the way I use the device.What google did was refine the basic laptop and wrapped it in a pretty bow, which is the same thing that surface laptop, macbook air have done.

It definitely rivals Apple's look and feel (from a hardware perspective). The quiet keyboard is without a doubt the best keyboard I've ever used on a laptop. The speakers are also great, though you won't want to use it for hosting a party. Oh, did I mention it has a 1080p webcam??I was a little worried about the M3 processor, but it's proven to work just fine for my light webdev work I've been playing with (Gatsby, NetlifyCMS, etc). It drags a little bit when opening multiple apps at the same time, but that's hardly a major annoyance. It's handled everything I've thrown at it very well, including the Linux ChromeOS beta.I whole heatedly recommend this device if you're in the market for an ultra portable secure productivity workhorse with amazing battery life.I'm never going back to Mac or Windows for a portable workstation.

",0.94544494294,pc,"I was originally going to buy the LG 27UD88 because of the single cable solution for my macbook pro. I dislike living the dongle life, so I wanted some way to hook up all my home office peripherals AND charge with one cable. Reading more about it online however turned me off from that as an option because I have the 15"", which requires 85W of charging, which the 27UD88 does not provide (the ud88 also drops its usb transfer speeds down to usb2 speeds when hooked up to the usbc port).I then stumbled upon ultrawides, and the 34uc98 and 38uc99 came up a lot. The uc99 would've been perfect, if not for its extremely high price point. The uc98, doesn't have a single cable option to provide port expansion and charging through thunderbolt.I ended up buying this unit (34UC80), since it's basically a 34uc98 without the thunderbolt (which I don't need) at half the price. I ended up just buying an elgato thunderbolt 3 dock to go with this (which provides 85w power and serves as a single cable solution solving my docking goals). Put together, they're cheaper than the uc98, and offered a better solution to my one-cable docking dilemma.
",0.594,pc,"I had been in the market for an ultra-wide waiting for the prices to normalize when they became mass market. I happened to see Costco selling a 34UM61 for $300.00, and as low as $279.00 on sale and picked it up. I got it set up and the brightness and display itself were brilliant, and I loved the 34 inch form factor as well as the advancement in technology with screen split. Out of the box there was some frustration about not including a port for display port so I had to get a unique DisplayPort to HDMI which held the monitor up for a few days.A week or so into use I say that the 34UC80 was $500 with a much higher image quality. It just arrived today and let me tell you the monitor is worlds away from the Um61. First and most important the screen is brilliant in clarity. Text that looked normal on the UM61 suddenly look fuzzy, and the picture quality pops, no blurred images of this guy. I've never been a fan of curved tv's because I think you lose a ton of viewing real estate, but on a monitor solely focused on one user the experience is phenomenal.Most everything about this monitor is an upgrade from the um61, even the stand is now tilt, height adjustable and ha side to side tilt. I appreciate the added display port, two HDMI As I type I have my phone connected to the USB 3.0 power charger and have the display port. These have a picture in picture and you can use 4 screens at once. Heck, it even comes with a wall mount option!If your curious my use preference is mostly to work but I would love to see how this thing looks gaming. I've already booted up Netflix in 4K and the picture rocks. I know this is not a 4K monitor but if I could choose I would choose this everytime because it's built as a monitor for monitor usage.If you have the ability spend the extra $200 because this is not just a standard upgrade, it is a huge shift into a better viewing world. This being said the UM61 is an amazing monitor, and I probably would not have upgraded if I didn't recently refresh my laptop with a dell 4K screen and NVidia processor. Maybe I will try gaming again.
",0.81784427294,pc,"I own two of these. One of them, after a few weeks began to show 'burn in' on the screen within just a few minutes of a document or file folder remaining opened on the screen.LG made me ship them the device, three weeks later they return it to me and it REMAINS UNFIXED!I call support again and they tell me to ship it out to them again and they will escalate the repairs. (Wait, didn't they already do that? YES)Bottom line... the 'Life Is Good' slogan is GARBAGE. Life with an LG Product is NOT GOOD!
",0.20183223594,pc,"No dead pixels. Amazing image quality. This was the best price point with closest competitors:  Pixio and an ASUS MX34VQ.  The Pixio had some risky reviews despite an attractive price tag approaching $500, and the MX34VQ was reported to have flickering issues.Keep in mind that the 34UC80-B is very similar to the 34UC88, BUT this model HAS NO SPEAKER. I wasted twenty minutes thinking that they sent me a defective model.  At this price point, the sacrifice is worth the selection because most monitor speakers do not sound very good, and a price premium for another model may not be worth it.  I had a USB soundbar for laptops sitting around, so the workaround was very easy.The IPS screen is crisp and beautiful.  Even though the monitor is allegedly pre-calibrated at the factory, some of the colors seem off.  I may calibrate the unit in a few months, but I'll be doing it on all my screens and would need to buy a unit anyway.  Lastly, the 34"" widescreen size at 3440x1440 is the perfect format for not needing to scale Windows and being able to read two documents side-by-side.  I had an 29"" LG for about 1.5 years before this model, and the screen was just too small.  I recommend every person contemplating a widescreen to spend a little more to get a 34"" because more problems may develop later down the road if sitting distance is not optimal.  Gamers will appreciate the 75 Hz freesync.  At the moment the VEGA 64 cannot push above 75 fps for most games set on ULTRA settings, so the 75 Hz isn't a problem.  Some may insist on getting a unit capable of 100+ Hz, but the top of the line VEGA 64 can't even perform at that level (yet, if ever).  People that are doing 100 Hz or greater must reduce their settings down to high or medium, which makes the point of higher resolutions somewhat moot.  In my opinion, the LG 34UC80-b is the perfect balance between price, performance, and features.
",0.82860791794,pc,"I love my new LG monitor. This is my second curved monitor. The first one is a Dell U3417W which has exactly the same IPS panel so the picture is identical. The Dell has the power supply and a couple of small speaker built-in that the LG does not, but the LG is several hundred dollars cheaper and has much better controls for the onscreen menu.A curved 34"" monitor will take ea day or two to get used to but once you do you'll never go back to a flat panel. If I had to make the choice right now I'd buy two LGs.
",0.594,pc,"I like the curve and the real estate when it works. But, the screen started flashing a few months back and tiny white speckles are rolling across the screen. The USB hub was nice while it lasted, but it isn't working anymore. I don't know how long it will last, but I am stuck with it for now until I can save up enough money to pick up a Samsung, ASUS or other quality brand. I hope it will last until then.I sent the seller feedback over a month ago and could not find any response to it at all.Once I start working my brain ignores the speckles and I can buy an external USB hub. The flashes interfere with work, but are short lived and infrequent for now. Lost my money on this one. First and last LG.UPDATE: I had switched the cable before, but was the same brand Cable Matters which had the same issue. But I decided to try a different brand AmazonBasics Mini DP to DP, and all the problems went away! I was not a cable snob before, but I think in DP cables it is important. The monitor is clear and not once has it flickered like before. I am very happy now! Sorry for the bad review LG.
",0.01805636394,pc,"Overview  I am a photographer and videographer who got tired of 4 24"" monitors (2 stacked on 2 configuration) and was looking for a replacement for all 4 monitors. I barely used the top 2 monitors because it was uncomfortable to look up for long periods of time. So I only used the bottom two for editing. I found this monitor by chance while watching one of the famous action videographers editing footage and kept my eye on it ever since. When I first discovered this monitor I think it was over $1,000 so I waited until recently to recheck the price. As soon as I saw its current $500.00 price it was a no brainer. I started to get two but decided I'd wait and see if one would suffice.The Good  I've only had it for a few hours but so far this monitor is excellent in every way. As you can see by the attached picture I can now edit a video and have After Effects side by side, or work on graphics while monitoring a PP timeline. When I first did the math I did not think it was possible that a single monitor could replace 4 monitors (on paper I had way more resolution with 4 monitors) but the high resolution and 34 inches of screen real estate managed to exceed my expectations. The best part is no bar in the middle where the two monitors used to connect.  The curve is a nice touch, I feel like it causes less eye strain because it feels so natural when looking at it. Also, if I do get a second one, together they will wrap around in a more natural way letting me use more of my peripheral vision vs. turning my head.  I'm looking forward to using the USB 3.0 hub in the back, I'll be able to connect my media readers to it without having to use a USB port on my editing workstation.The Bad  Ironically the only problem I have with this monitor is not even the monitor's fault. The one thing I have found so far that I do not like is that the stand does not let the monitor go all the way down until the monitor touches the stand. I keep my chair very low to the floor because I spend hours editing video and photography footage and I like my monitor just as low as my chair. It is annoying that I cannot lower it until it touches it's base. I may buy a 3rd party stand just so that I can lower the monitor further down.  I need to add to the bad section after using this monitor for about a month. I finally got around to calibrating it and it does not allow you to set a manual white balance. I would have thought a monitor focused on the video creation and photographer community would let you set a manual white balance to make calibration easier. It's a minor thing and my Spyder still managed to calibrate it but it's still something LG could have easily provided.Conclusion  Nothing short of amazing monitor. Time will tell if I need a second one, for now the first one fits my needs perfectly.
",0.19544136594,pc,"Pretty good. I use this for work (software). No issues with response times, bleed, or ghosting. Matte coating is nice and brightness is good. Curvature could be a little stronger, but that's subjective. My one complaint is about subpixel arrangement and clarity. I've noticed that certain one-pixel white diagonal lines, like small bitmapped fonts displaying <<<>>> characters, tend to shift the perceived color from white to red or purple. I don't have this issue with my older apple thunderbolt display, and I could only explain the difference after taking some macro close up shots of the panels. The LG's pixels just aren't quite as crisp for the same pixel density. But maybe that's what you get when buying a ""cheaper"" display like this one. Overall I'm happy, but I'd look more closely in person before buying another.
",0.87666708294,pc,"This is my first ultrawide monitor, replacing a dual 1440 x 900 monitor configuration.  I have been using dual monitors for nearly 10 years, so I really wasn't sure if I would like the transition.  I wish I had not worried so much, because this was a great switch.  The snap feature in Windows 10 makes it nearly as easy to use the screen real estate as a dual monitor, without all the messing around with setting dual displays.  If you really need that multi-monitor feel, LG has software that can simulate that for you.  I never ended up needing it, so I can't say how well it works.The monitor itself is high quality and looks nice on my desk (the lack of cable clutter helps).  It feels like it has just the right amount of curve, and it is barely bright enough for use in a sunny room.I have a few nitpicks:- The multi-input mode only allows a combination of DisplayPort and HDMI, you cannot use both HDMI inputs together.  I have no idea why they would do that.- You cannot use the USB ports for fast charging and as a hub at the same time, though you can select between the two modes.- There is light bleed from the lower corners of the screen.  It really isn't too bad, but it is noticeable when watching a movie in full screen.In the end, these problems were minor enough for me not want to knock off a full star.  It might be a bigger deal to other people, so I thought they were worth mentioning.

I ended up choosing this one as I like the extra rubber grip, it really helps with cramped hands. It also comes with two screen protectors (in case you mess up the first) and even an alcohol pad and cleaning cloth. I was amazed at how the screen protector glided on easily with no bubbles and you can't even tell it's there.I almost chose a clear case that was hard plastic on the back and front but chose this hard rubber one just for the back because I didn't think I'd like the feel of the plastic cut out/molds around the buttons and analog sticks while playing. Plus really a front piece is unneeded since most falls will happen to the back and there's not really a way to protect the front buttons/analog sticks anyway.Anyway, good quality for the price, I'm very happy!

I was really surprised with the Arctis 1.  It is very comfortable and light weight.  The head strap padding is pretty good and the fit works both on my head and my sons head (12 years old).  He really likes the detachable mic (personally I don't care as I just use it for gaming, but he likes that he can connect it to different devices that don't use the mic and therefore doesn't have a large mic in his face).

",0.911391973100,pc,"I’ve gone through exactly 3 headsets (The official Microsoft Xbox One headset, PlayStation Gold Wireless headset 2018, and a Razor headset) looking for a viable option that had both DECENT audio and mic quality, as all the headsets I’ve purchased have had build quality issues and terrible mic quality. I’ve given up on picking up a wireless headset as from what I’ve seen, are incredibly expensive. I saw the ad for the SteelSeries Arctic 1 headset and it seemed too good to be true (very cheap price for a wireless headset, and interchange between 3 consoles) and to my surprise, it lived up to pretty much all its claims. Wireless connectivity works seamlessly with its included dongle, and I have had zero dropouts or latency issues with it on both PS4 and Nintendo Switch. I originally purchased this headset primarily for the PS4, as I imagined wireless headsets were completely incompatible with the Nintendo Switch, but the headset does in-fact work effortlessly and all the buttons on the headset (Mic Mute On/Off, Volume Dial) work on both systems. Mic quality is excellent as well as audio quality, it’s perfectly balanced and not ridiculously skewed towards bass, and the volume can be raised very high on both consoles if you want. Battery life so far has also been great, it’s something I haven’t had to worry about when using and I only had to charge them once every week out of habit. The headset itself doesn’t feel flimsy and seems decently built, It’s pretty light and is surprisingly comfortable to wear, so much I use it also when I’m on my laptop. The only thing that slightly annoys me is that when I switch playing consoles and want to use the headset on it, I have to get up and unplug the headset dongle and connect it to the console I’m using (say, from the PS4 to the Nintendo Switch). This is pretty much a first world problem, but it’s something I’ve come across every once in a while.Overall I have to say I’m really loving this headset, if you were on the fence for this thing I really recommend you give it a try.

It doesn't seem to pick up foot steps very well. I have tried to adjust the in game audios even looking at other recommendations but have not been able to solve this issue.

",0.51,homeneeds,"I bought a bunch of these. I was pleased with them at first - setup was pretty straightforward, and the Alexa integration was easy.Flash forward about 4 months or so: almost all of these are now failing. Specially, they will lose connection to my WiFi. Unplugging them and plugging them back in will sometimes fix the problem, but not for long. I did a factory reset on the 6(!) of these that I have that are failing, and upgraded the firmware. The next day they’re all failing again with the same issue.Unhappy. I’d recommend avoiding unless / until TP-Link can fix this problem.
",0.1284997461,homeneeds,"After researching automated light switches and outlets to control my lights, I picked TP-Link because they do not require a separate hub to work. Out of the box, install or plug-in, load the Kasa app and create an account, discover using the Kasa app (connect the device to your WiFi at home) and you're ready to go.I absolutely LOVE the light switches and the outlet plugs. The online TP-LINK installation videos are awesome; short and concise with clear instructions.  These Smart devices work perfectly every time using the Kasa app, Alexa and now the Google Assistant. When the power went out once, the devices automatically reconnected and worked flawlessly. BEST PURCHASE EVER!!!I bought the Amazon Echo Dot - 4 times - and controlled my lights from anywhere in the house simply by speaking to Alexa.Then, as of 3/25/17, Google Assistant got in the action. So now I can also tell my phone ""Ok Goggle, turn on the Basement"" and the two Smart Plugs (one mini and one original-sized) turn on together since I made a ""basement"" group to include them both.If you're buying these Smart Plugs or Smart Switches for the first time, the below info will be helpful to know to avoid asking yourself ""why is it not working for me the way people say they do?""1. You need to install the Kasa app and create a user account to operate your devices using your phone/tablet. The Smart devices must be able to connect via the WiFi in your house to be operated remotely (by you not manually touching the device). Although you can still operate the devices manually, you bought these to operate them remotely. The Kasa app let's you name each Smart device (IMPORTANT: NAME EACH DEVICE AND GROUP AS YOU WANT TO CALL IT OUT USING ALEXA OR GOOGLE ASSISTANT) and create ""Scenes"" to group multiple Smart devices to turn on/off at the same time. Tapping on the device name in the Kasa app opens the options to set schedules, timers and more.2. Got an Amazon Echo? Install the Alexa app on your phone/tablet, add the Kasa Skill, link the Kasa Skill to your Kasa account (from point #1 above), discover devices, then create Groups - similar to the Scenes in Kasa - and select which devices to include in the group for Alexa to know what you meant to turn on/off at the same time. If you DON'T create groups in the Alexa Skill: A) Simply ask Alexa to turn on/off the individual Smart device name, and... B) Alexa will NOT know which multiple Smart devices to turn on/off at the same time - even though you created a Scene (group) in the Kasa app, key phrase here... ""in the Kasa app"".  After you create a group name and include Smart devices in the Alexa Skill, you'll feel like one of The Jetsons, a Star Trek crew member or a millionaire, with the power to command lights on and off using you voice: ""Alexa, turn on the Living Room"".3. Got an Android smartphone/tablet with Android version 6.0 or higher? Google began sending upgrades to those devices to install the Android Assistant - the same Artificial Intelligence (AI) used with the Google Home device (the device that competes with Amazon Echo).  Here's the deal, similar to the Alexa Skill, you NEED to enable and setup the Android Assistant using the similar steps I described in topic #2 above: Link it to your Kasa account, create Group names and add Smart devices to the group, etc.  To set up your Android Assistant to operate your TP-LINK Smart devices, start by saying ""Ok Google, turn on my LIGHTS"" - the AI is smart and will prompt you with a bubble for you to setup Google Home interfaces. It's da bomb!Hopefully this will help you enjoy your TP-LINK Smart devices as much as I do.If you're thinking ""I'm still not sure if I should get these or another brand...""  GET THESE!!! You will not regret it. They work great! Also, when I had questions, their customer support was very responsive. The love is definitely there.My goal is to get my entire house upgraded to use only TP-LINK light switches. In time, as the budget allows, it will happen.
",0.7906861311,homeneeds,"ZERO customer support for a product less than a year old. Horrible customer service.First two plugs quit responding to internet after six months within 3 weeks of each other. Amazon replaced them and out of the box they won't connect to the internet. Tp-Link customer support was nothing more than 45 minutes over chat of resetting them and another 65 minutes via phone doing the same the resets with the final resolution was to send them a screen shot and they'd look into it. What? No offer of replacement or suggestions as to when I can anticipate a response to this issue. So take heed when reading 2 year warranty. The man @ TP-Link I spoke with was beyond rude. VERY disappointed!
",0.1046202781,homeneeds,"This mini goes offline a lot and it's super annoying. I have several of the regular TP-Link smart plugs and they work flawlessly but I wanted to get a mini for space-saving reasons. I called tech support and they asked me to do a factory reset. It didn't fix the problem. I called again but they said hold times were long again so I chatted with a tech support person. She had me try to update the firmware but it couldn't find the smart plug on my network. Tech support for this company is horrible.
",0.0410486461,homeneeds,"I started out by purchasing 2 of these to control standalone lamps in my master bedroom and home office/den. I quickly used the Krasa app to add them to my network, then in less than 60 seconds I used my Alexa app and connected these to my Amazon Echo system, which now consists of 3 echo dots, 1 regular echo, and a new Echo Show.I then bought 2 more to connect my living room main light and an additional lamp. Flash forward to this year with the onset of the Christmas season. Because I go all out for Christmas, decorating my entire downstairs and part of the upstairs, I had one goal in mind—to control ALL of my Christmas lights on both levels through my Echoes and dots, which means going through my Krasa app. To accomplish this, I purchased a few more of these smart plugs in the 2-packs (which are slightly cheaper than buying them individually). I used the Krasa app to add them to my current setup, gave them a short name so I'd know which was which, then I used the Alexa app to discover them all. I presently have 8 of these around the house in various places, with Christmas lights, animated figurines, even my main Christmas tree all plugged into these smart plugs. I did this with the help of extension cords and a power strip that are used to accept the plugs of all the aforementioned lights and figurines, etc. The power strips are at the end of the chain and get plugged into the TP Link mini-plug. Then on the Alexa app I place all of these mini-plugs into one group entitled, quite simply, ""Christmas lights."" When I want to turn them on, I now simply say, ""Alexa, turn on Christmas lights,"" and instantly, all the lights, figurines, and the Christmas tree are on. I use a similar command to turn them all off. No more running around to all the different outlets, bending down, maneuvering around tight spots or Christmas decorations that are placed to hide the outlets, plugging and unplugging everything. My entire house can now be all controlled with one command to Alexa.I should point out that for me, the setup of these mini-plugs to my Wi-Fi network took less than 1 minute per plug, if that; and connecting them to my Krasa app (the app used with these devices) also took less than 1 minute. Ditto for getting them set up in the Alexa app. Total for each device's complete, individual setup was about 2 to 3 minutes.Final but very important note here: if you have an old Wi-Fi router or a weak signal in some parts of your residence, the latter of which is common if your router is placed a bit of a distance from your mini-plugs, you will probably experience connection issues when trying to set up or use these devices. In all seriousness, if you're going to even have an Echo or Dot, you really ought to seriously consider spending the money to upgrade your Wi-Fi router, and this might include buying a setup like the Netgear Orbi, which is THE best system to give you powerful and strong Wi-Fi in a large home of 3 stories, for example. Extenders aren't that good. The Orbi is uniquely different. My Wi-Fi router is a year old, has 4 antennas on it, runs all the wireless bands, and was placed by me in the center of my house, providing a very strong signal to all my various devices, of which there are plenty.Lastly, it's also good to have a reliable and fast Internet service. After having Comcast for so long, where I had their fastest service at the time, when I moved into my newly constructed house in summer 2016, I went a different route. Comcast was wired for my new subdivision, but they didn't even realize it! Because they argued with me about this, telling me they couldn't provide more than 100 megs download and 25 megs upload, I decided to go with AT&T, which had installed fiber optic lines along their entire paths. They hooked me up right when I moved in, and I'm getting 1GB download AND upload on my wired main PC, while I'm getting anywhere from 700 to 900 megs download and 700 to 900 megs upload on my wireless connections (wireless will always be a bit slower than wired). This absolutely blows away Comcast, and at a lower price! More importantly, however, these speeds provide for far more reliability and performance with my TP Link smart plugs and smart bulbs, which I also have.
",0.51,homeneeds,"I am trying to get this installed on my 2.4G network with other amazon alexa devices, kindles, HP printers, Samsung phone, etc.  Lots of problems.  TP-links phone support is as bad as it gets.  They don't know their own product - for example they told me to press the restart button on top the plug - there is no button there - the manual says there is an on-off button on the right side of plug.  Of course that is what they mean.  You have to install a unique app Kasa and register on your smartphone.  Problems there.  The tech support person of course blames my network, my router, everything else.  Then he (Oscar) says he will send me a youtube video link with more detailed instructions and to call back if more questions.  I asked to speak to a native English speaker or supervisor since clearly there was a communication problem between us.  Not an option.  His sole objective seemed to be to ""get me off the phone"" so he must have an objective to meet - e.g. get rid of a caller after 10 minutes.  I told him there would be no further phone calls, if I couldn't get it to work after the one long phone call and the video, it would be returned.
",0.0835496781,homeneeds,"This is the first ""smart plug"" device I have purchased.  We have several switches on timers and an older automated lighting system in the house, but I wanted to control some string lights in the porch and since there wasn't an outlet there we looked for alternatives.  Initially we had tried one of those inexpensive remote control outlets.  It worked OK for a while, but at times the remote would be unresponsive.  At other times the lights would come on or shut off by themselves.  We started wondering if perhaps a neighbor had the same type of switch and our signals were interfering.Enter the TP-Link Smart Plug.  This is ideal because it only covers one of the receptacles which allows us to continue using the other one.  We utilize a few of the Amazon Echo devices in the house so integrating with Alexa was a must.  I have a few other TP-Link devices in my home and have been pleased with them, so I figured I'd give this a shot and I've been very happy.Setup was easy.  I downloaded the Kasa app on my phone, walked through the simple instructions, linked it to Alexa via the Echo app... and done.  Setup took maybe three minutes and it worked perfectly the first time and every time since.  There are no batteries needed, and no other devices (hubs or other hardware) so all you need is the one Smart Plug, a smartphone or tablet, and wifi.  In fact even if you didn't have wifi you could still control this from a smartphone but you would have to connect to the wifi in the plug itself.Now we can simply ask Alexa to turn the lights on or off and the response time is practically instantaneous. I thought there might be a lag of a second or two when using Alexa but that hasn't been the case.  I can also use my phone to turn the lights on or off (or any device where you have the app installed), or I can set different timers or various scenes if I really want to.  However, for our purposes a simple on or off is all we need.Also, the unit does have a button on the side so you can turn the lights on or off manually - but we have the plug buried behind a cabinet so we won't be using that feature.  This is really about as simple as automated lighting can get.  I'm very happy and eventually I can see installing some of the hard wired switches in various rooms to allow us even more control over lighting and the ability to ask Alexa to shut off the lights downstairs since asking the kids doesn't seem to work nearly as well.Based upon my experience I'll most likely continue going back to TP-Link for our other smart devices since the app is so easy to use and having multiple devices together in one app allows custom scenes and things like vacation mode etc.The only minor (and I do mean minor) negative I can think of is that as of now I do not believe there is a way to dim the lights controlled by the switch.  I somewhat understand that since TP-Link has no idea what kind of devices people might plug into it and therefore they wouldn't want people dimming power to devices that could be harmed by this.  However there might be times when having the lights on at only half power would be nice, so just be aware that as of today this is a strictly on or off plug.  They could change this down the road with a firmware update perhaps, but I'm not expecting that to happen.  If you want to dim your lights, you'll likely need to invest in one of the hard wired switches that offers that functionality.
",0.51,homeneeds,"This product only worked for not even a year. I have contacted customer service numerous times! They had me update the firmware, and have me press the reset button for a minute, when I told them that I already did that then they asked me to do it for 2 minutes!

",0.7566183811,homeneeds,"Pros: Works way better than WeMo. Enough said? Setup is way easier and less buggy. Resetting is easy and fast, unlike WeMo. If you use Alexa, these never have an issue and do not lose connectivity. The Alexa skill is flawless now.Mixed: Setup sometimes freezes but it's quick and easy to reset. Once it's connected, it's all good.Cons: Kasa is a buggy app when used to turn lights on and off BUT if you connect it to Echo it will have zero problems. Just don't use the app, and strictly use Echo and you won't have any issues with losing connection. Maybe an app update will fix the problem but the problem is exclusively with the IOS and Android Kasa App. The Alexa skill for Kasa works perfectly and consistently.

They work well, they have lots of different colors, and they're really cool when playing music.We are really happy with these lights. The app took a little while to work, but everything is perfect now. We bought these for our sons room. He listens to music to get to sleep and uses a nightlight as well.
",0.9457176922,homeneeds," What fun! I had a different set of strip lights from another seller prior and they would come off and didn’t have a remote. These are by far much better/brighter/durable/convenient. I don’t have to get in the small space to plug them in to work it’s as easy as pushing a button. Also very easy to use. These lights are perfect for entertainment, hanging in a kids room or lighting small spaces.  We are pleased with the quality.I love these lights. They can be used for so many things. Very bright and love the ability to change the colors to suit my whim. They work great and appear to be very well made. I will surely be buying more.
",0.9779595142,homeneeds," This is a great price for the amount of things you get. I have purchased these trips before for different parts of my house. Sometimes these kids do not even come with everything that you need and this one does. I have looked for a lot of different LED strips but this is the best price and so far it works great. It changes to lots of colors the remote control is awesome. It is also very very bright I did not expect that but the light setting can also be lowered so that is great. I have the lights set up and they are very bright. The app is pretty intuitive and easy to use.
",0.978410842,homeneeds," Wanted to decorate my room a little but couldn’t think of anything, ran over this and though this will add some color to it ! So it comes in 2 pack and both work perfectly. Long enough to reach across my room which is exactly what I needed. If you in college and wanted to decorate the dorm room this will be a cute little gem !! Wonderful price!! Definitely recommend !
",0.8528156882,homeneeds," Hi im so happy about this product i purchased this last week and till now its working fine.. its very long it comes with 2 separate roll and with a extension so that u can join them together. For this table i use the first roll. The controller port where u attached the strip has 2 port so u can connect the other roll. The remote is ver ly responsive i put my controller box behind my table and i can still control and change the light whenever i want it. There is a option that u can switch to follow the music beat which is i did in my video. Just check it out and by the way they are very bright.
",0.52,homeneeds," I’ve been buying a lot of LED strips lately to deck out my house, and these might just be my favorite so far. The strips have genuine 3m adhesive on the back of them, so they’re super sticky, but be careful as they might take the paint off when you pull them down. My box had a set of included clips if you don’t want to use the sticky back of the strip, though, which is a very nice plus. The controller and power brick for the lights feel solid enough, but not going to win any awards. The strips themselves are incredibly bright compared to the other strips I’ve used, which was very surprising, and it’s noticeable when you put them side by side.
",0.2048806552,homeneeds," These LED strip lights are easy to set up.You can change settings with controller or with remote. Only wish is that itThe colors are bright and vibrant. I haven't installed this strip under my island, so we can use it at the party time or even like night backlight

",0.9817025662,homeneeds," This product is very cool and fun. I love how this product is very sustainable and energy saving because it does not emit heat, which make things so much safer. Another thing is the quality is remarkably very good because it’s very smooth and it’s not sharp. I used this LED light at my restaurant and there was so many colors to play around with. With this product shining and glowing brightly, it attracted more customers to come which made my day. I highly support u to buy this, you won’t regret.
",0.9799633032,homeneeds," I wasn't hoping it does such a good  demonstration. But it turned out totally amazing! There is 0 difficulty on the setup, basically plug and play. Color switches through remote control and app on the phone. And it's got a lot of length to work with. I'm really impressed!
",0.2230702643,homeneeds,"This is for the 100W equivalent warm white bulbs rated at 1500 lumens.  Upon installing the first one, it was obvious to me that it wasn't as bright as an incandescent 100W bulb.  I took the light meter app on my phone and measured a 100W incandescent bulb and got a reading of 1430 lumens and a color temperature of 2900 Kelvin.  Substituting these LED bulbs, I got a lumen reading of just 950 and a color temperature of 2800.  That's over 1/3 less than the rated output and so I tried several out of the box of 16 and got very similar readings.I then went to the local big box store and bought a name brand 100W equivalent LED bulb.  Physically, the bulb is quite a bit bigger and the light output was a whopping 1470 lumens at 2900K color temperature.  This was what I expected from the Amazon branded bulbs so was disappointed.  I did check the markings on the bulbs to make sure I didn't get the 75W equivalent and no, these were supposed to be 100W equivalent.This is the first Amazon branded product that I have been disappointed in - clearly they did not quality test these bulbs before branding them and selling them.
",0.53,homeneeds,"I put them in my kitchen fixtures. They are SO different than my usual more golden color. They made the room look white/blue bright, very awful aura and not comfortable for me at all, and took them (6) right out. I don't know what I did wrong in choosing them. I am putting them in my outdoor fixtures. Not a comforting light for me. I tried ordered a warm LED but idiot California will not ship to me in this State. Some new law again....Maybe the 100 watt is too much. I want my 'warm' light back!!! Where are you warm LED's??? Wish I could change out the politicians in California so easily...
",0.0383802953,homeneeds,"From my usage, the bulbs (100W Equivalent, Daylight, Non-Dimmable, 10,000 Hour Lifetime, A19) have a lot of positive features:+ Speced at 100W Equivalent (15W, 1500 lumen).+ A19 'normal' light bulb size (many 100W Equivalent are larger A21 sized).+ Usable/safe in enclosed light fixtures (per a response from the manufacturer in the ""Customer questions & answers"" section).+ In my garage door opener, they do not seem to add any interference that decreases remote range.+ The Daylight 5000K color temperature seems accurate and they are not noticeably blue 6500K LEDs trying to be passed off as ""5000K"".+ So far I have not noticed any hum.I have found it difficult at this time to find LED bulbs in the ~1500 lumen range that are both A19 sized and safe to use in enclosed fixtures, so that is a big win.But there are some cons:- Non-dimmable (minor con and they are clearly labeled as such, but it would make them more multi-purpose).- 80+ CRI (again per the manufacturer in the ""Customer questions & answers"" section); 90+ would be nice.And the biggest con for me by far:-- There is a noticeable green tint to my eyes.This may be the cause of some of the negative reviews that call the 100W Daylight version 'harsh'.  As I understand it, this is common with many currently available 4000~5000K LEDs, especially when they are driven at lower currents to keep them cool and efficient.As I was planning on using these for garage (supplemented by some nice 4000K LED lights) and outdoor (covered) lighting, this isn't a major deal breaker for me.  However, I did use some for interior lighting to see how they worked; I am definitely not a fan for this usage.Still, 1500 lumen/A19/safe in enclosed fixtures may bring me back for interior lighting, but I would definitely choose the Soft White (2700K) version instead.
",0.53,homeneeds,"I purchased these for my boyfriend after nagging him for 3 weeks to replace the burned out lights in his ceiling fan to no avail. He was using his desk light instead (because that's clearly an adequate substitute).I lost patience with his promises to grab them ""next time he was out"" after the 6th time he failed to deliver and took matter into my own hands. Amazon prime 2 day shipping to the rescue. I purchased the 75W equivalent lights and screwed them in. There wasn't any delay with the lights having to warm up, and the three I screwed in all worked right off the bat. I came back later to find my boyfriend unscrewing one bulb complaining that they ""worked too well"" and were too bright.Even with one bulb taken out, the room is very well lit and the soft white is pleasant and warm, but not too yellow (which is important since I do my makeup in the room).I also noticed that the bulbs don't seem to heat up like the old ones did, which was a nice bonus since I've burned my fingers before.I'll update this review if anything happens, but for the past few weeks, so far, so good

This projector is awesome because of projects actual snowflakes Spin and move on your wall or House Etc it's very easy to put together where it has a stand base or wall or ceiling mount or a stake that can stick in the ground and it just requires 1 screw and one nut that is a fingertight type of screw so no tools necessary. The only thing that I noticed was that it made a lot of noise in the what might be considered upright position so when you turn the light or turn it upside down it makes no noise. Excellent
",0.8327900174,homeneeds," A little early for the Christmas decoration but it's never too early to start planning. Especially when you live in an area that has a ton of snow and don't want to climb up the roof and put up and take down the lights. This is one of the most useful things that I've ever bought and it's very easy to install. Just simply plug it in and it looks great with the mixture of all the different kinds of sizes of snowflakes and animations make for all the lights.It comes with all the accessories you would need to put it in the ground or hang it somewhere. It's an LED projector so it also means that it doesn't take up a lot of power consumption unlike normal lights.
",0.823014144,homeneeds,"I love Holiday/Christmas time! This LED snowflake projector light sup the garage area in the front of our house and that’s what I wanted. It rotates and Has different patterns so makes it a lot fun to see. Plus side it doesn’t require batteries only outlet in and we got a few in the front yard so worked out for us. Also ya a stake so y can angle it in various ways.
",0.8828926684,homeneeds,"I love the design of the lights that comes out of the projector. It has different patterns with a small and large sets of patterns which is cool. It has an adjustable angle up 180 degrees. This one is best ine to use indoor or outdoor. I""ve tried using projector light while raining and it works perfect.And I love the way it projects indoor . Perfect for small parties. Worth buying it. I may order one more .
",0.982835714,homeneeds,"Bright, well focused projection. The motion of two patterns make it even more interesting. From about 15’ away it covers the front of my house top to bottom about 20 feet pattern projection. I’ll probably get a second one to finish the entire house. Two different mounting systems (yard stake or mounting plate) and full range tilt adjustment make it usable in virtually every situation.
",0.8607922794,homeneeds," So, I did take the video inside and during the daytime because it’s only October and I don’t want my neighbors to think I’m completely crazy, but you get the idea. Nice, classy snowflakes moving continuously.The unit itself is pretty small. Simple parts to assemble. Comes with the lawn stake as well.Much easier than putting up and taking down a bunch of Christmas lights, but still festive.Very reasonable cost considering it replaces outdoor Christmas lights.
",0.7634924654,homeneeds," These projector lights are awesome. It is bright and in focus. It will cover an entire house when properly positioned.  It is an actual snowflake projector, compared to other Christmas projector shows that are just green and red colors or dots. It was extremely easy to assemble, no tools necessary. The base can sit on the ground or screw into the ground with the accessory piece. A must Holiday accessory, that I recommend.
",0.939939384,homeneeds,"I know it's only Halloween now but we are already preparing for Christmas gifts and decorations as we are very excited! We like to be prepared! We saw our neighbor's christmas light projection last year and decided it was much better than doing the decorations manually.We just tested the Christmas lights and they are beautiful. It is smaller than we thought it would be and takes up less space. It is easy to operate and we took one second to install it. The snowflakes moves automatically and is really pretty.There are two different mounting systems. Either the yard stake or the mounting plate. We used the mounting plate but both are easy. There is a full range tilt which probably makes it usable for most homes.This is so much better than hanging lights all over ourselves and I dare say, even more beautiful. Wish we did this years earlier!
",0.8856641054,homeneeds," This little light projector is incredible! It projects moving snowflakes on any surface and doesn't require complete darkness. We tested this out over the past weekend and our house was covered in snowflakes. It look so cool and the kids really loved it. It comes with a ground stake so you can stake it in the front yard to project onto the house. But we're thinking we're going to use it to project snowflakes on the large 9-foot hedge that separates our yard from the neighbors.We have those bluetooth speakers that look like rocks. So we're going to have it playing snow related xmas songs while this little baby does its thing projecting snowflakes.Definitely a great buy for us. We love it.
",0.9184266924,homeneeds," This was super easy to install and put in my yard. Instead of taking time to untangle my Christmas lights, grab the ladder, and hang up lights all I did was stick this in the ground and bam. Done. We live in a duplex so our porch is small. You can see in the video that the unit is relatively close to the house since I wanted it to only shine in one specific area. The lights are bright blue LED which makes the snowflakes look crisp. I wish there were different designs and a longer cord, but it’s still a great thing to have.
",0.8051048525,homeneeds," I found this product called a led strip lights in my friend's house. I like its indirect lighting, and changing color. I think the strip lights can be used for lighting, and the color changing light can also be used to arrange the atmosphere. This is great!I bought a set before, I arranged the led strip lights in the living room, its indirect lighting effect is very good, I like them very much. That is a waterproof light strips.This kit is a bit different, it has the function of music synchronization. The light changes with the rhythm of the music, it's awesome.

",0.929575926,homeneeds,"As far as functionality seems pretty good, better than the previous version, I will report back after a large mounting job tomorrow and let you know how it went compared to a standard stud finder.The first thing I noticed about the product is its poor ergonomics, scanning is awkward, your hand covers the phone to scan, or you have to hold the phone really low making it hard to hold. It's even worse in pan mode because you have to hold the button down continuously to get it to scan ( odd choice )If you mount it evenly it will also cover your power button on back if you have an LG, and the camera ( not a big deal ) but having to pull it off just to shut down the phone or lock the phone is awkward.I partially solved this by mounting the phone higher on the unit but it doesn't feel as secure, and the panning button is still a royal pain to keep pushed, why in the heck did they do that?The phone attaches to the unit by a two-sided sticky gel pad, it works fine, but when you pull them apart there is a tendency for the pad to fall off on the floor and get gunk on whatever it touches, this is more of an annoyance than defect because you can wash the pad. I do wish they would make the Walabot side permanent so that just the phone side came off.EDIT:ProsClients are ""Wowed"" byWorks well on thick drywall/lat. I had a 1+1/2 Inch drywall in an apartment, normal stud finder even in deep mode didn't work as well as this.ConsChanging this to one star almost entirely because of the ergonomics, which are terrible1) They need a better mounting system, this is super annoying to use for more than finding a single stud. Had a job with 15 mounts ( 2 TVs, 7 Pictures, 5 Shelves, 1 Bathroom towel bar ) and I only used it when the standard stud finder failed ( which was only once ) it's just too annoying to use, kept almost dropping it.2) Backing doesn't work well on knock-down textured drywall. It 'bumps' along and has a tendency to 'jump' off the wall requiring a rescan and it makes a horrible noise as it scrapes along. I realize they want the sensor as close to the wall as possible but they need to fix this. It does no damage but if clients are around it makes a terrible racket on everything but really smooth walls.3) They do have a center mark when you find the center of the stud but it's tiny and hard to mark with4) Finding the center of the stud doesn't seem as accurate as of the newer stud finders with multiple centers.5) It's not that good at locating high voltage lines, sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't my standard stud finder always does.I will keep it just to wow my tech-savvy customers but then put it away for real work, or only use it if the stud finder can't find anything.ConclusionSad, I really wanted to like this thing because it is cool to use but there are too many flaws for anything but casual useIf they could fix the above issues it would easily be a five-star product.
",0.0213224296,homeneeds,"I was excited to try this, but I am afraid this tool is going right back to Amazon. I bought this version of the Walabot because it said it worked on lathe and plaster walls. Unfortunately that is not entirely true. When inspecting lathe and plaster walls, the sensor only works in ""expert mode,"" which displays  a near unintelligible heat-map-looking-thing and not not the color-coded visual outlines the stuff inside the wall. That might work really well for an expert, but for a newbie like me it is entirely useless. I would have to have practice with switching back and forth between easy mode and expert mode while inspecting drywall walls before standing a chance of understanding the expert mode images.So, if you have regular drywall construction, this might be a really useful tool that lives up to expectations. If you work on a combination of drywall and lath and plaster walls, I think you could get the practice needed to interpret the expert mode images, which really do look very useful if you understand how to read them. But, if you are a newbie who has only lathe and plaster walls to inspect, I suggest looking elsewhere. A deep stud scan sensor that tells you when it encounters metal or electrical lines as well as studs is much more newbie friendly tool at about one third the price.
",0.2019859556,homeneeds,"For $90 this thing better do a damn good job. It doesn't do any job, at least not on anything besides 1/2"" drywall.

They've served me well and continue to be used on a daily basis -- but the price is still a bit high to add more of them to the house. When I learned about Wyze - and found out they offer the same kind of plugs, but at a much more affordable price, I figured it was worth $20 to give them a shot.So far, they're super easy to set up using the Wyze app, and connecting them to Alexa through the iPhone app (after enabling the Wyze skill) was also a breeze. Right now I'm using these on lights, but seeing how people are using them on various other electronics has me intrigued and I'm definitely going to experiment with those, which will likely mean buying a few more of these. I'm really impressed with the quality for the price - and the ease of installation is honestly just so simple.
",0.9411705739,homeneeds,"I bought these plugs as I already had a Wyze camera to monitor our 3d printer and wanted a ""kill switch"" for the printer in the event something goes wrong that we see on the camera if we're away. It easily connected to the app and was simple to setup. Hopefully this plug is not going to be needed often but it definitely works as intended. Also we have an extra plug for the same price as most single smart plugs. Excellent value!Update: 10/18/19: our second plug was defective and would not properly set up. I contacted Wyze through their app and after several emails, they agreed to send a new plug at no charge. The new plug arrived today and hooked up just as easily as the first plug. They have great, prompt customer service!
",0.8062962299,homeneeds,"Having connectivity issues with plugs. Have 3 that work and 7 cameras. Text chat sucks and CS doesn’t return messages.Cameras are good. Customer Tech help, stinks.Update: Tech support called back and walked me through the network issues. All plugs work.Suggest they add support on weekends.
",0.1045380839,homeneeds,"I've just placed my third order for the 2-pack of these.  I'm using four of the plugs and I just ordered more for a gift.  They will be especially convenient for turning my Christmas lights on and off, but they also work for any device that will come on when the power to it is simply turned on.  You can set them up in groups so that all your Christmas lights come on without having to individually turn them one one by one.  I use Alexa to control my plugs, but they can also be controlled through the phone app.  They can also be timed or even set to a random on/off vacation mode.  They are super-easy to set up using the Wyze phone app; no hub or anything else is needed.  They have three prongs but almost all outlets now take three prongs, so that shouldn't be a problem.  They are small enough that they don't block the second outlet as some smart plugs do.  I also like the Wyze bulbs but these are more versatile.  At ~$20 for two plugs, it's hard to go wrong.
",0.8855270749,homeneeds,"I bought these to automate our indoor lights around the holidays. Alexa integration makes it nice. I was able to group 8plugs into anHolidqy Group and at sunset they all turn on and then off at midnight. I also hooked them into a goodnight routine. When I tell Alexa goodnight, all the plugs turn off as well as other automated bulbs and switches. Nice integration!  Well done wyze. Hope Smart Home integration is possible in a future update.
",0.9595270759,homeneeds,"Easy to set up and connect to wi-fi. It's small enough that you can use one on top of another with a standard American outlet. Does not monitor energy usage like some smart plugs from TP-Link.
",0.9718071829,homeneeds,"These setup easily and quickly. Like maybe 2 minutes if that.  Third Wyze product for us and we couldn’t be more impressed at the value they offer. ordering their lightbulbs next.
",0.9206390389,homeneeds,"It's amazing what Wyze makes for the money.  These install very easily and work like a charm.
",0.9091292629,homeneeds,"These work great. Setup was easy and I've had no issues with them. They are easy to use from the wyze app, Alexa, and Google home.
",0.95363974610,homeneeds,"I received this and had it set up and working in just minutes. The directions were clear and easy! I can now check on my pets any time of the day and also can go back and find out how that lamp got knocked over! The picture is clear in the app and the pictures it takes are high quality and clear. I will be getting more of these for other parts of my home.
",0.90596520910,homeneeds,"I didn’t know whether I wanted this camera for my hedgehog or my hamster so there are pictures of both. I must say though out of all the cameras I’ve boughten with night vision and day vision this HD CAMERA is my favorite. It gives off high resolution in both the day and night ... it is a great pet camera and I assume it would be a great kid watching camera too!! I just might have to purchase another one for my daughters room to watch for her getting up and out of bed when she’s not suppose to!! But for now I love this camera to help watch my fur baby.
",0.87399077410,homeneeds,"This is my 2nd camera using that require MIPC app so i can pull up all in one appQuality is superb for my mudroom and living roomSo i can check my pets when im away from homeEasy breezy installation
",0.89945548810,homeneeds,"This is by far the best home monitor camera I have used.  The resolution on both pictures and videos are excellent.  Easy to setup and be running in less than 5 minutes.  Interface is clean and intuitive.  Just drag the image to pan and tilt.  Don't waste your time with others, you won't be disappointed by this camera!
",0.92991268610,homeneeds,"This camera is absolutely perfect, just what I was looking for! I am using this to look after my dog while at work. The ability to pan zoom and tilt is the best. I can keep track of what’s going on at home in perfect HD, the camera even has two-way audio and night vision. I am thinking about purchasing another for my lower floor. You will not be disappointed in the wonderful value this indoor camera provides.
",0.79452353710,homeneeds," I've been looking for security cameras lately to watch over a sleeping baby but also to see inside/outside the house. After 3 days of using this indoor camera, I can say video and audio qualities are very good, so clear, during the day or night. Installation is a breeze and using the app, the camera is easy to control. Love that  you can zoom in, out, go left and right using the app very easily. This security cam makes it easier to check on my kid while she plays in the downstairs room and see what dad and baby is up to. :-)  The only thing i dont like is that I'm unable to download the videos straight from the app. The pictures are automatically stored in my gallery and is easy to access but im at a loss on how to export the videos. If there is a way, well it's difficult to figure out on my own. Overall, I'm satisfied with this security camera and I'm at ease coz I can watch over my kid without worries. Great little camera at an affordable price!
",0.94515681310,homeneeds,"First of all, the camera looks really nice. The footage quality is good. I had a little hard time to connect the camera to wifi at first, just make sure you connect with 2.4 Ghz wifi. I can watch my puppy from work now.
",0.90919375410,homeneeds,"These cameras have come along way. I bought one last year and the resolution of this camera is so much clearer~day and night. I put in a picture with my review when my room is very dark and it was very clear. I love the fact that The camera can be controlled to move throughout the room so you get a much better view than just the stationary camera. The sound is crystal clear as well. I will soon try to buy a few more. At this price it is an absolute steal. This camera is highly recommended. Set up is also very Via the intuitive app.
",0.96134209610,homeneeds,"Let me preface this by apologizing for the mess in the pictures because we are currently moving.This is a full-featured camera that can use Ethernet or Wi-Fi.It has both pan and tilt features accessible by the app on your phone or tablet.I'm using it via Wi-Fi and I do notice a 2-second delay.I believe with ethernet the delay would be less or non-existent.So there's a picture of me in my living room and then the picture of its zoomed in via the appto see the picture quality.I also included a few screenshots of the app from my phone.The cats are looking bewildered when I talk through the speaker when they know in not home.The picture quality isn't as good as my thousand dollar lorex cameras, but it's really good for the price i paid!
",0.70360088310,homeneeds,"This is a great small compact security camera. Just what i needed for my wife’s daycare. Quality and picture and audio works great. Built is awesome and can also be mounted on the wall. Can’t ask for anything else.
",0.94323378811,homeneeds," I enjoyed these lights way more than I thought I would.  I like how it has an app that you can use to control the lights.  It has a setting so that they will flash along with music that you are playing from an outside source, or even just from talking!  This also entertained my daughter for hours!  She likes how you can talk to them and that makes them ""dance"". You can also play music from your app and they will dance along with that music.  It has a very extensive color grid that you can choose custom colors in your routine, or you can use the standard 8 or so that are on the remote. We have some of the lights tucked away behind the tv since we didn't use the full 16+ feet of the lights.  It has a double-sided adhesive on the light strip so that you can attach it to whatever you want.  I am pretty sure I can just get more double-sided adhesive to replace it with if we ever want to move them to a different spot. So, to sum it up, I am very pleased with this purchase and if I ever have a need for more in the future, I know where I will buy them from!
",0.97800368111,homeneeds," You can't go wrong with these LED lights.Very easy to set up, you don't have to use the whole amount of you do not want to, or you can, the choice is yours. You can use the remote which gives you mutiple color options along with RBG, FLASH, FADE & more. You can even connect it to your phone to control the color options which is awesome in my opinion. Also comes with screws if you wanna hang else where aside from using the included tape on the strips itself. I really think it's a good look and I would highly recommend these. Like I said, you can't go wrong.
",0.75793558411,homeneeds," This is the second similar light strip I bought and I really like the quality.  Although it seems this is not built for outdoor like my other one it does not matter since I'm using it for my home office.  The strip puts out a decent amount of light and the color and mode options on the remote are plentiful.  In my video I have it in the flash mode which is great to see the art on my wall change.  The set up was easy but like my other one I recommend to use another double sided tape as the adhesive it comes with seems to fail right away.  I use a bit of the double sided gorilla tape every three feet and it holds amazingly.I tried to get the app to work but maybe it's just me and I couldn't get it to work.  I don't think I will need app capability on this one so I'll stay with using the remote.  I will definitely buy some more for other rooms in my house
",0.7928556211,homeneeds," Really cool! My kit arrived promptly. (The next day via Prime.)Pulled everything out of the box and I started playing immediately.  Had the kit going in less than a minute, plugged in and started playing with the different light combinations.  Like most electronic nerds, one plays first -- and reads the instructions later.  In playing, I mean that I unrolled about the first 2 feet of the tape and left the other 14 or so feet rolled up on the plastic spool it came on.  First I played with the little remote that it comes with… and then downloaded the iPhone app and had a grand old time.  That’s when I realized that almost an hour had passed.  Something smelled HOT.  Hmmm.  LED’s run cool, right?  Apparently NOT the case when you leave them rolled up on the roll!  By golly, these things got hot enough to melt and warp the plastic shipping spool.So -- I included a picture of the the now warped spool/reel.  No loss, however -- I didn’t purchase the product for the spool.  I purchased the lights to surround my beloved 5 x 4 foot <BoSToN> wall hanging in my Tech cave.  My question now, however, was just how hot did these things get?  That answer later...My calculations were to surround the wall hanging on the sides and top.  I know my math, 4 x 5 is 20 -- And the kit comes with just over 16 feet of tape.  In my case I needed to trim of just about a foot of light tape off at the bottom right edge.  I did this after installation. The tape is easily trimmable to any length.  If I had about 4 feet more I could have surrounded the entire wall hanging.  However -- I have a shelf beneath the hanging -- so the bottom was not a concern for me.  It’s nice that there is however a 32 foot option available for purchase.I preplanned my installation and started from the bottom left, up across the top and then down the right edge.The adhesive on the back of the LED tape was impressive.  I was concerned that perhaps it would fall down off the wall I stuck it on after it got warm.  The kit DOES come with some plastic clips and tiny screws -- but as of right now, I’m not using them.  The adhesive stuck well.Installation was quick and painless.  I just stuck it to my wall.The result?  Nice.  It's really a cool, rather inexpensive product.  How COOL?  Once installed, the lights don't seem to get hot at all.  I’m sure that the wall now becomes a heatsink, and my concerns were completely erased.Here is my list of likes and dislikes:LIKE:1.  The lights are impressive, colorful, bright and allow just about any combination of a single color that you could want.2. Easy installation, and easy assembly.  Seems very durable.3. The tape was perfectly foldable and I was able to make sharp corners by folding the tape over itself.4. Impressive adhesive.DISLIKE:1. I see the packaging and web site contains pictures of running the lights ON the spool.  Just not a very good idea, as the LEDS without something to absorb heat will allow the LEDs to produce heat.  Perhaps a warning to this effect might be in order.  When NOT unspooled, the LED heat is concentrated.2.  The iPhone app is great.  However, it seems that you HAVE to turn the strip on/off from the remote first.  It would be nice to be able to start/turn on the strip from the iPhone.3.  There is a music function on the iPhone app -- but not practical, as there isn’t any music function without using the iPhone.  Unless one could dedicate a device to the strip, you probably won’t use the music function much in real life.  Might be a good use for an old iPhone if you have an older model sitting in a desk drawer.OVERALL:Still impressed, and I would definitely recommend and purchase again.
",0.85356056711,homeneeds,"The Leds are fine fso far for 1 area to be controlled.  Bought 2 of these for the kids rooms.  The adhesion of the double sided tape is fine and they worked perfectly after 3 hours ilof having them so who knows how long they will actually last.Not the issue this is all good however they do not have different frequencies for the app or conteol.  I expected the kids could control these from the app without controlling the other set in another bedroom.  We found out immediatley the tv remote controlled the lights as well which could be cool if thats what you want however if you dont want them on while watching tv you should probably unplug them.I bought ILUX once before and they had a great bluetooth capability controlling multiple sets however one set did lose its capability to display all wavelengths after a year with about 100 hours. If you wanted green you might get orange as an example and no green.The bluetooth ability was perfected without interference among multiple sets but the LEDs malfunctioned in various wavelength outputs.Sad to say I have not found a great set yet though its probably out there as indicated from my past two experiences.The take away is if you want 1 set only within a range inside remote capability this is great.  If you want multiple sets for say  a different room close to the other set then you will be in control of the other sets when you might not want to be.  This can be dissapointing and frustrating while your daughter is trying to sleep and your son is watching tv and changing lights while switching the channels.
",0.79908049111,homeneeds,"I was a little nervous that this would be too complicated for me to figure out but it was really simple to set up. I bought it to add some festive and ambient lighting. It comes with two 25 ft reels of LED lights. I used one to add some lighting behind our TV set. The adhesion is great and you can cut the LED strips at specific intervals. I liked this kit over other ones I saw because it had the ""L"" shaped connectors that allow you to create corners when connecting your LED strips together. I used the included anchors with double sided stick tape to adhere it to the back of the TV set. After you have your LEDs in place, you just plug them in and use the remote to control them. You can customize these LEDs in a million different ways: color, flashing/not flashing, pulsing to music, brightness. It's very cool! We have a lot of LED light strip left and I plan on putting them in the kids' bedroom under their shelves for some accent lights.
",0.88590002111,homeneeds,"I used these LED lights for my gaming setup, and to say the least I am very satisfied and impressed with these. They're simply just wonderful and adds a lot of color to my room. Included in the packaging is all 16.4ft. of LED strip, and a remote to control it. The lights are bright, and I have had them for quite a while with minimal issues. I personally didn't use the adhesive, I used painters tape, and instead just taped them up so in the future I can reuse the lights instead of having to get rid of them completely.Overall: The lights are at a very good price point, and you will not be dissatisfied with them in anyway, There is lots of fun options, and you can change how bright or dim the lights are via the remote or the app you can download for even more fun features. If you're looking for some LED light strips these are the way to go. These LEDS are a way to use your creativity and make something fun out of it!
",0.90644276111,homeneeds," I am a huge sucker for lights.  I love them everywhere. These are great not only because they change the colors but because they are really long!I only needed a ladder to install these light and no other tools.The are really easy to install with the connectors they have. The ones that go around the corner makes it super professional looking once installed.  My daughter got these ones and she is in love with them so much.  the changing of the colors is nice for morning and night time at night she turns it on a blue so her sleeping isn't interrupted by bright white lights.  The sticky backs are great and easy to peel off the cover over the sticky tape.
",0.90989446611,homeneeds," I put these in my sons room. Overall, fairly satisfied. I had ordered a different brand from another company and I have to say that these ones were much stickier, so that’s definitely a plus. They are very bright and look really cool in the dark. Still trying to figure out how to work the app for the remote. The only bad thing about the product is the connecter. It doesn’t seem to stay together so I had to tape it. That’s my only thing that bothers me! Overall, a pretty good product!
",0.10608127711,homeneeds," I have tv leds from same brand , so had trust in them and hence bought power adapter leds for my kitchen project.Used them on the cupboard over the stove. It is true to size and sticks very properly as it was for tv led.  This one came with remote and which works with other brand led too. So basically same remote i am able to use to control both leds in kitchen.Best part of this one is that it shows as 2nd device in app and both can be controlled together with same selections of colors. So , I would suggest to go for all LED’s in home from this brand so that single app can control everything.
",0.512,homeneeds,"I have used my headlamp for the past few weeks and wanted to make sure I gave it a fair review without just jumping to conclusions.First Impressions:The Bad...-Right out of the box I was starting to wonder how anyone who received this product gave it anything above a one star. It feels terribly cheap (It is!) and the build quality is really low. It also has a very strange odor when you pull it out of it's case. Just expect to feel a lot of plastic when you first touch the parts you may have expected to be aluminum.-I think that it's biggest shortcoming is definitely the battery housing. The cover that protects the 18650s and wiring is a soft piece of rubber that is merely held on by a little friction. No clasps or straps to ensure a tight water-resistant seal. I highly doubt that it would be able to endure a heavy rain or just prolonged exposure to a wet environment. I would definitely prefer a plastic cover with a rubber gasket and some form of fastening to keep pressure on the seal.-The lighting system, while only being housed in plastic is bright... just not anywhere as bright as they advertise. I would have to guess (comparing to some of my other flashlights) that it is closer to 1250-1500 lumens with all 3 lit. It is not noticeably brighter than my Thru-nite that is advertised as 1250 lumens.The Good!-The weight of this headlamp is great! While this might be due to the lower quality build materials, it does allow it to be forgettable while it is on your head for extended periods of time.-The angle adjustment is not loose and does not hop around from movement over time. Often headlamps with a large set of lamps on the front can be annoying from having to readjust it numerous times during a hike, but this one does well.-The light focusing system works well! It is nice being able to adjust the central lamp from a wide angle down to a focal point that turns out to be just a square projection of the led chip.-From what I could tell the battery life is sufficient. I did not run out of juice and did not notice any decrease in the light's brightness  for a three hour sojourn in the dark. I was however flipping through the light intensities since I rarely use the brightest settings unless I am setting up camp or attempting to see across a field.-The charging system is pretty decent. I like that the charger has a notification light to let you know when it is done charging. Just a convenient trait to have if you must charge the 18650s inside the headlamp.-The case is actually pretty solid and is convenient so that you do not lose the charger when using the headlamp. Just don't lose that case now...OVERALL:So overall I would say that this light is alright. It is really cheap and you can tell by handling it. However that is what you should expect when paying less than 30 dollars for a headlamp with this many features. While the components are definitely a bit cheaper, they actually do a good job! (With exception to that battery cover) The battery cover is the only piece that kept this from being 5 stars and that leads me into my final thought. While this headlamp can do a lot for a low price, it is the specs that it advertises and boldly puts out there that is far from accurate. It claims that it is ""Waterproof"" without giving any form of ip rating, which should speak for itself alone. Also It claims to be 6000 lumens which is just an exaggeration. These parts are major selling points in headlamps and they know that because they have been quite fine with exaggerating this flashlight's capabilities. If that is fine by you, then go for it. I think it is a fine flashlight for the price and will keep using it until it stops working.Update (June 26, 2018): I was contacted by the seller recently and have been shipped a secondary unit to evaluate and see if the overall build quality and light output was just from a faulty unit. I will update based on the findings and comparing the two units fully charged. I did up my rating from a 3 star to a 4 star in the meantime to account for customer service. Also I have yet to run into any additional  qualms when I expected by now it to stop working.
",0.7505743512,homeneeds,"Very - Very bright lights; GREAT for running! You can see almost a full mile ahead of you plus all around you. You can adjust the scope of the light as well. Perfect for running trails/road in the dark.When I first purchased this item and went running, the headlamp became extremely uncomfortable. I initially thought that I was wearing it too tight so I loosened it but then it started jiggling very badly. Then the top strap broke after a few miles. Seems very poorly put together. I was so disappointed because the lamps put out so much light and I run early in the morning when it's dark. I posted a negative review and the company contacted me immediately. Seems like I received a defective product. The headlamp was missing the padding on the light housing that sits on your head and the straps were defective. They immediately sent me a replacement at no additional cost. Already used the replacement and it rocks! Great head lamp and great customer service. You cannot beat the price for this.
",0.15185874712,homeneeds," This 3 LED headlamp comes with 2x 3.7v Lion batteries, a charging plug pack, and a case to store everything in.The overall construction is more than acceptable, with aluminum LED housings, and heavy duty components. The focus mechanism on the main lamp works amazingly well, and ratchets easily.The LED function is fairly standard, operating from a single button to select modes: main on, aux on, all on, strobe, off. A dim red light on the battery pack lights up when the lamp is functioning.All parts of the lamp that touch your head are padded, which is nice. The lamp is on the heavy side, so the creature comforts are well appreciated.
",0.91338843112,homeneeds," This light is great for riding my bicycle at night. I feel safer alreadyCon- should have come with a 5v 1a power supply for charging the light.But it’s still a great value for the price.
",0.88536882412,homeneeds," I went hiking up Mt. Elbert at 3am.  I put all my faith in these and they paid off big time.  I had the headlamp on the lowest setting and it was plenty.  I had them on for almost 3 hours, I didn't notice a single drop off in brightness.  I will test them out more.  As of now, this is the best headlamp I have ever owned.
",0.80796623212,homeneeds,"This headlamp is awesome! I live out in the middle of nowhere with nothing but natural lighting and no street lights. They are great to use while walking my dogs and being able to hold on to the leashes and not worry about fumbling with a flashlight. We haven’t used them for camping yet, but I can only imagine how useful they will be.The adjustable telescopic lighting is great to see pin point locations in the woods, so it is fun to point out deer and other critters to my dogs and wife while we are walking in the dark.The battery life is fantastic and they are super easy to charge. I would definitely recommend for any kind of outdoor setting!Bonus feature: my wife uses them often to do her nails and groom the dogs. The softer setting dual lights allow her to see exactly what she is doing!
",0.97316157812,homeneeds," I first want to point out that this has a pretty universal fit since I can stretch it wide eoniug to fit on a hard hat but also make it small enough that my 7 year old can wear it confortable without it beeing too loose.This has three lights that work in different combinations which also deternime the run time. If all three lights are on it will last 1- 3 hours whereas if you use it in the two side light mode it will last 3-5 hours.  The charginf time is 7-8 hours for a full charge so I would suggest getting some extra batteries for backup for long trips.Some of the features I love on this is the adjustable headband with one that goes over the top of the head which really helps to stabilize the lights and set a good fit without giving yourself a headache from over tightening.Another feature that I love is what I call the follow light. On the back of the battery pack which sits on the back of your head is a red light that is lit when the light is on in the front. This makes it much easier for people behind you to follow in the dark and not have to try to constantly adjust their eye while trying to just follow you headlight. This feature alone put it above all other headlamps I have used.This head lamp also comes with a two prong power cord for charging but like I said I would get more batteries. Please realize that these are not AA batteries but a size 18650 li-ion which can be found on Amazon for fairly cheap.This has been a great addition to my go-bag for emergency response and is also very helpful in dong car repairs and those dark honey-do’s. This lamp makes me a lot more useful being able to use both hands.I did notice that I may need to put some sort of clips on my helmet to keep the band from slipping off but hat is not a design flaw at all…just a functional one that I need to figure out.Finally this does come with a convenient case to store it in so that it doesn’t get banged up while be transported or stored.Overall I give this amazon light a 5 out of 5 stars.
",0.84925240312,homeneeds,"Awesome quality!!! This headlamp is very bright...I could stand at one side of my house in the dark and see all the way across the room(more than 80ft). Fully ADJUSTABLE 3 ways for your perfect fit for children on a camping trip, or adults for any outdoor activity at night! Very bright light and love how it has 5 different brightness options to choose from!

",0.92876052913,homeneeds,"I was worried when I bought this that splitting the power between three devices would like them charge slower but it didn't so that. I've plugged in three different chargers at once and never was any of them slowed down. I like that this pack comes with two because I can bring one to travel trips with me and not worry about having enough USB ports!

If I forget one wall plug it's frustrating having to remember and take the time to charge devices on a rotation.

I would absolutely recommend this! I know my kids will want to keep this up to use all year round! LOL
",0.98472100514,homeneeds,"So far so good. I purchased these because the description said that it ""Can cover up to 5000sf"". I am not sure about that large of an area, because I do not have the 35 ft distance from the house. I can tell you that it does cover a larger area than anything that I have tried in the past. I placed this about 15 feet from the house and the images were bright and very clear. The product is made of metal and it does come with a remote. So far it does everything as described.

",0.23846450416,homeneeds,"It arrives in a very compact box. It's very easy to put together in about 3 minutes. Had I wanted it shorter, I could have removed one or more poles.The lamp itself is of surprisingly high quality. The base is nice and heavy, but it's light enough that you can easily move it from room to room.The neck is quite easy to bend. My lamp stands approximately 55"" tall behind my couch and is a good height to provide focused light on a reading area.Lights are bright and come with 4 brightness settings as well as 4 color settings, ranging from yellow to white. I like the amount of light this puts out and there is plenty of light to read in even at it's dimmest setting.There are 2 cool touch buttons. You could adjust the colors by tapping ""M"" and brightness levels by on/off button. (PS: Turning off the lamp, you need to hold on the on/off button for 2s.)The wall adapter has a good length of cord on it, about 7' total.Overall I'm pleased, feel like I'm getting more than my money’s worth with this one.
",0.91999936116,homeneeds," First of all, I must admit I thought it is a bad product which is not, because of touch bottom (on/off); however, I finally figure it out and you should before you hate it. No need to press or firm touch, just click to turn on but hold for a second to turn off.  This lamp exceeded my expectations. I assembled it easily with a tight fit. The gooseneck is super easy to maneuver. The choice of light color and brightness is wonderful. Most important to us is the fact that the light can be adjusted for the benefit of the user without shining into the eyes of other people in the room, because of this diffusing cover panel.
",0.87779301416,homeneeds,"Room desperately needed some better lighting during the night and this lamp helps a bunch. The light is extremely bright and has multiple different settings depending on your preference. I also really like how it has like 4 different options on the color of the light. There's a full white option, full warm, and then some variances between those two which makes it perfect for any room and any time.The light was really easy to set up too. Just gotta screw some poles together and plug in it and you're set. The base is really sturdy and bottom heavy so no need to worry about it tipping. Really easy to move and position also!Definitely met my needs and may be buying another here soon for a different room!
",0.93181574316,homeneeds,"They were easy to assemble and they work flawlessly. I love all the adjustments I can make to get the brightness and color temperatures just right for me.There are 4 different levels of brightness (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) that you just tap on the button on the top of the lamp to adjust. Note: The POWER button is also the button that cycles through the brightness settings,  and you have to hold the power button down for a few seconds to turn it off.Then you can adjust the colors (3000 kelvin, 4000 kelvin, 5000 kelvin, and 6000 kelvin). At night, I use a warmer setting. It's very easy on the eyes.The adjustable angle and convenient height make it practical for a sitting area as well as a work table. Perfect for crafts, sewing, and painting, etc.The base is heavy so it is very stable and does not fall over. I personally do find this led floor lamp attractive and would use it as a regular standing lamp in my living room.The box is super small and the lamp is easy to assemble that it took less than two minutes to screw the different pieces together.I highly recommend this lamp!

This light can adjust color and brightness. She said her eyes feel more comfortable. But, I don’t feel LED can 100% replace light bulb. Since the size of LED is small. It is more suitable for reading or makes room feel cozy. If for having a bright feeling, lightbulb lamp is still a good choice.

",0.92486125218,homeneeds,"This LED Christmas projector is pretty cool, and I’m excited to set it up outside after Halloween passes.Pros - This thing appears to be pretty bright, even in regular daylight it is working well on the walls. I like how it has a remote as well to turn it on and off. Thing comes with a remote to make it easier to turn on which is nice if the weather is bad outsideCons - It fills potentially cheaply made, the time will tell. I wish that it would turn back on automatically if it was left on when the power was turned off. I like using smart sockets to control lights, and this requires someone to turn it on with the remote or push the button on the back.This is great for anyone that likes to decorate their home, especially those who don’t like to hang traditional Christmas lights.It seems like a great product, it works really well. Hopefully it holds up well over time.

With a busy schedule like mine I’ve had to resort to more efficient methods. Using a Christmas Projector I will be able to make my home festive without all the hours it takes to decorate.The Christmas projector was easy to set up. Just open the box, attach the stake by tightening the bolt, and your are ready! Plug it in and you can see the different snowflake patterns. There are a couple variations to choose from. Just use the remote to adjust to your favorite one.I really like the simplicity of setting this projector up. I could definitely see me using this projector for many years to come. After setting it up and positioning it in my yard I realized it might be better to use 2 projectors to get the best look. The remote makes it easy to adjust the different settings. I’m happy with my purchase and it’s overall quality for the price.

Works great! Very pleased and impressed with purchase.
",0.99069589418,homeneeds,"I’m a huge fan of Christmas decorations outdoors, but don’t have the time and energy to keep up with it. This was a great deal and got the job done! It covered my whole house and was bright enough.

",0.82032734218,homeneeds,"Has 3 different patterns that it plays in different modes.  I plugged it in and played it on my living room wall. Don't know how great it would be outside at a distance, but set up near a wall would be ok.

",0.96204537220,homeneeds," This is one of those things...you didn't know that you needed it, until you got it...and now you don't know how you lived without it! It is very easy to install, just make sure that you have a flexible hose attached from your water supply to your toilet. You add the included T-valve, and you instantly have a Bidet Toilet Sprayer. The nozzle can be mounted to the wall (as I did) if it does not fit your toilet lid. The quality of this sprayer exceeded my expectations. It is a nice and solid stainless steel and it feels like a sturdy piece of equipment. The nozzle adjusts the pressure depending on how hard you press the trigger. Full blast is strong, yet the stream is pleasant. Great for personal clean up, cleaning the toilet, and watering the plants in the bathroom! Great product, highly recommended.
",0.92877745620,homeneeds,"While traveling abroad, my wife raved about these.  I laughed at her for it, but I bought one anyway.  To my surprise, this device is truly refreshing.  It piggybacks off of the water going to your toilet.  I feel cleaner and now I understand why other cultures have these in their bathrooms.  The brushed finish to the nozzle and handle is very stylish.  It also comes with a hanger that rests inside of the toilet bowl allowing you to hang it on the outside.  There was also no drip while hanging unused.  I tried a local version of this product and it dripped so I had to uninstall it.  I now have another reason to keep my kids out of my bathroom.
",0.7716163420,homeneeds,"Let's start with the installation it is very easy to install you only need one ranch and your job will be done. You have everything that you need for installation in the package included noni to think that you need something extra. The water pressure is  aqequate for your cleaning use. I was thinking whether the experience will make a mess in my wooden floor but with narrow opening of the faucet I don't have to worry. There is an on and off switch included where you can switch it off if you do not need for every day use. The length of the pipe which comes with this is really a liquid and you can use it in all those unreachable places easily.
",0.80924522920,homeneeds,"This came with directions, but it is also pretty self-explanatory....even for me (a young female homeowner with no idea how to ""fix"" things lol). I did screw on the threads slightly sideways at first so I had to redo it ...so some tools were involved. However, if you actually install it correctly and put the threads on straight, it is very easy to install and very fast! to test it, though, turn on the water very slowly so that you can check before it leaks....if it does. I like the fact that the flow is adjustable since if you leave it fully open, you will probably be hurting the next day lol. if you turn down the flow, it is very pleasant.... just wish there was some sort of heating element so that it isn't freezing cold. Overall, this product does exactly what it is intended to do, easy to install, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an at-home easy install
",0.77635705520,homeneeds,"I have two full size bidet in my main bathrooms.  Needed one for my small guest bathroom. The handheld one is a perfect fit.

All accessories came in box I didn't have to buy anything. Was so excited about installing didn't take pictures of the accessories.  Appears to be of good quality. Now even my guest can have a clean bottom.
",0.24436855320,homeneeds,"The spray was made by stainless steel that coated with the chromatic layer. Therefore it is very easy to clean and sturdy. The spray comes in a whole set that can help you to install it with ease. However, it does not include tools for unscrewing the part. The nice thing is that it includes hook that can attach to the water tank so that you dont have to drill the wall. Please pay attention to the pipe diameter because this one has a bigger diameter than the regular water pipe.
",0.86511087420,homeneeds,"Very quick and easy to install, you may need a wrench to loosen the bolt/valve for the hose connecting the hose to the toilet tank. Mine was on pretty tight and I couldn't just unscrew it by hand.Instructions provided are simple to understand. All parts are provided. Everything seems to be good quality and durable.Adjustable water pressure is greatVery versatile! On top of the intended use, I also use this to clean the toilet bowl and the shower stall.

I can pause it, but then you dont get the movement of the sparkle or twirl. I was hoping to get a little more from this 1 since it said it could even be used for other holidays. How can I use this for other Holidays? It even specifies Halloween... I will make use of it for Christmas, but I'll have to find another 1 with slides for other Holiday use...
",0.75458067721,homeneeds," excellent holiday entertainment for my toddler! The moment I turned this on she was laughing and talking to the lights. It was easy enough to set up, the only downside, for me, was that this was really just made for outdoors, as it includes a stake to stick in the ground to hold it up, and no other stand so you can use it indoors. I flipped the box upside down and stuck it in that so we could play inside with it. The changing patterns and wide range, this was a good buy to keep my child entertained.

",0.17967814222,homeneeds,"I am using this product for a freezer in my garage.  It works well, always has a connection on my phone when I check it.  It seems very accurate.  I like the history function as well. My only problem is the alert section.  You can only set the lower alert temperature to -4 degrees.  Sometimes the freezer dips below and I get an alert, constantly every 10 minutes.  I have adjusted my freezer to try to stay above -4 which in general works.  My concern, of course, is if the freezer gets above a certain degree, say if the power turns off, or it breaks, etc.  I wish that the lower limit for the alert range was lower, say -20 degrees so that I wouldn't get alarms which I don't need. If there is a way to do that, someone please help.
",0.13631284222,homeneeds,"""Very useful combo once you calibrate them by taking the temperature and humidity in the same room. Humidity of both units match but the outdoor unit gives a consistent +2 degrees above ambient temperature. Confirmed by comparing the temperature reading from a different branded digital thermometer. I placed the outdoor unit inside a weatherproof receptacle cover to protect it from rain and snow.If you live in cold weather make sure to replace the provided AAA alkaline batteries with lithium batteries for the remote unit. Alkaline batteries will stop working near freezing. Lithium batteries keep working below freezing.UPDATE: The indoor unit stopped measuring humidity level after two months. Kept displaying 'LL' even after a reset of the unit and replaced batteries. Requested replacement unit from seller. Arrived in a couple of days. Hope it lasts longer than first unit.""
",0.522,homeneeds,"It does what it says it does.  Tracks temperature and humidity.The app itself can be used for many other products from Govee, and at first it was slightly confusing, but downloading app and setting it up only took a few min.When you link up your phone it shows you the whole history.  Even without a phone, it shows you high and lows, which is a plus.  I'm not sure how long 2x AAA batteries will last, but so far so good.  I prefer AAA over lithium batteries anyway.  Lastly, like others mentioned the display itself is slightly light, as if the battery is low.  The display is just b&w and letters/numbers are not dark enough to be read easily.  I can still read it and my main purpose was to use it with my phone.  Thus, it still gets 5 stars from me.
",0.24428591122,homeneeds,"It works, and it was easy to connect to the phone via Bluetooth. But it is impossible to see anything on that LCD screen.Update: Seller send updated version with much better screen.
",0.87649899722,homeneeds,"I bought a bunch of these devices to place in each room of the house to monitor the workings of my aircon, one for each duct, so 6 sensors.After adding the device to Govee Home app, I used an accurate temperature probe and via the app, calibrated each probe.  They each ""needed"" individual adjustments of up to 0.4C. The fact that you can do the adjustment is nice.The sensors are easily communicating through the single storey brick veneer house, with distances of 20m or so the furthest device.I measured the operating current of the device as 175uA. With AAA batteries, they should last 9-12m between battery cycles. I have one unit loaded with Panasonic Enloop cells and working well, too.The sensors record and hold a temperature and humidity history of the last 20 days with a granulaity of about a minute. It transfers this data history each time you click on the sensor details. So be prepared to wait for the data transfer to complete before continuing.Alexa doesn't find these devices, but being bluetooth based, I guess that is the reason.On the down side, the LCD display is not great, but readable. The characters are large, but not highly visible. No where near as good as the photos show. The display is not backlit, though that is not a need and would kill any serious battery life.
",0.522,homeneeds,"Bought 2 of these for my greenhouse and I love them so far. It's nice to pull data logs for humidity and temperature for both location via Bluetooth. Ready setup... Just add the included batteries and place on site. The LCD indicator is a little dim but readable at an angle. Downloaded the iOS app and now I can monitor the greenhouse from 150 feet away. To pull logs you'll have to be a couple feet away from it.

",0.96607387123,homeneeds,"So first I'll start with the fact that this product works absolutely amazing!! I bought this to mount behind a gaming computer dual monitor set-up but I couldn't get it to work right for what I envisioned. I gave some thought and then did the next best thing, I used this for a new computer desk I built and it turned out fantastic.The adhesive stuck on perfectly and has had no issues for over 2 week. The colors and transitions look absolutely amazing. I highly recommend this and will definitely be buying more for my tv's.
",0.86732995523,homeneeds,"I grabbed these LED Strip Lights since they were specifically designed to placement around a TV.  They were easy to ""install"" since it was basically sticking them around the TV. With the lights off, they gave my 55"" TV a very cool theater like effect which I plan to use when I watch action and sci fi movies.Pros include enough strip on a single roll for a 55"" TV and easy of use.  Cons are that if you mess up sticking them to your TV, you might need to use some extra double sized tape to get the job done.

There is beauty in the glow, they are so easy to use, and this set in particular does very well for our reoccurring power outages. These are usb powered, and living on a mountain we see power outages a lot. We keep power banks charged, and these lights do very well to light my room on their own when necessary. We're very seriously considering getting sets for the hallway and bathroom as well. These are made for the back of a television, but in my home provide much more than only simple decoration.
",0.89349389123,homeneeds,"Not much to like about this product.  Replacing old LED strip lights (white only) for tv. Fortunately, I knew the problems that occur when putting the lights on the back of the tv and didn't remove the adhesive backing but used painters tape to hold it in place. Upon turning the strip on the following occurred : the blue lights are light up on one third of the strand, the green lights are one half blue and green, the white lights don't work at all. The red, orange, and yellow function perfectly. Will be returning both sets purchased and buy from another manufacturer. If I'm having this problem now, can't expect reliability in the future.

It has 2 remotes, so useful and high quality.

",0.0870682924,homeneeds," Needed these for a work decorating event, these were prefect.Great remote range, nice color options.  Easy to setup and use as well.  You can link them together in a long line or you have 3 plugs to choose from and you can go in three different directions.  I recommend a little piece of tape around the connection to make sure it stays put, otherwise prefect.

When someone cooks, the taste will rush into the room through the crack of the door. I don't like the taste of food in the bedroom. Since the installation of this roll, it's completely cut off the taste of food. I really think it's too practical. I decided to paste every door in the house.

",0.76627361826,homeneeds,"To begin this I want to say that all of the Work Sharp products I now use, aside from this single item, have surpassed every other knife sharpening product I have used for over 40 years.Now, for this item:For  the price, this a decent & useful item. Of course it lacks the ability to sharpen a serrated blade. Since it is a square, & having rubber (or other rubber like material) on the sides, it’s easy to steady it on a flat surface, making it easy to get the proper angle with which to effectively sharpen a knife or other implement.The over all 4 star rating comes from its being a bit bulky &, as stated above, you can’t sharpen a serrated edge.But, for the price, & given the right circumstances (not needing to sharpen serrated edges), you could add a 5th star for your own purposes & needs..
",0.93338668326,homeneeds,"I was extremely surprised how much I got out of this sharpener for the price point. Normally, I wouldn't bother even trying something this cheap. But the reviews were so good I figured I'd give it a shot. Now I'm the next one in line giving a 5 star review. If you need a variety of knives sharpened quickly and effectively, this is the way to go!

",0.31636774526,homeneeds,"The Work Sharp EDC Pivot Knife Sharpener is a handy little tool to have.  It actually does a pretty decent job of sharpening a blade with not much effort involved.  While I like how compact this is, that does also make for some issues with safety.I tried to use this on two different pocket knives to test it out.  One is the standard buck knife.  This works great for that type of straight blade.  I also tried a blade that half-serrated towards the bottom.  That’s a little trickier because you can only sharpen the top part but if you're going fast it can get caught on the serrated edges.  Also, you have to go slow with this because of the size.  If your not careful it’s very easy to cut yourself since it’s so small.  I like this as a portable/travel option to have on hand for a pinch.  It does work very well when used properly.  The blade ends up very sharp and cuts extremely clean.  I do think a little larger of an area to grip would be helpful in getting a stronger hold on the sharpener.  I understand the concept of keeping it small though.  That’s kind of the selling point with this item.  For the price and the effectiveness, I would say it’s definitely a buy.  I just think you need to be careful and I would have a larger size one to keep at home.  This is a great choice for an add on to that and for traveling.
",0.88077914726,homeneeds,"This is just an amazing value, for an outdoors enthusiast or scout you can't beat it. Its small and cheap enough you can buy several... one for your glove box, backpack, and with your camping gear. I would not use it to sharpen a expensive raiser sharp blade or felt knife but for your leatherman or pocket knife this does a good job maintaining a sharp enough blade to get the job done.One thing to note is that the sharping piece is set back a bit into the plastic so depending on your knife handle and how close the blade gets to the handle it is possible the sharpener won't get all the way to the start of the blade that buts up to the handle.If you find this review helpful please press the helpful button, thanks!
",0.526,homeneeds,"A quick, easy sharpen with this multi-part tool.I tried it on an old Henckels kitchen knife that was much too blunt to be useful. Using the two sides of this sharpener restored a decent edge-- maybe not as good as new, but good enough to migrate the knife from drawer back to knife block. Faster and more effective than my kitchen sharpeners, which don't do well with badly blunted edges.Pictured: With a 3"" paring knife.This sharpener won't turn your dollar store special into a premium santuko, but it will make dull blades usable again. This inexpensive tool is also super portable, which may have bearing on sports/outdoors users.Although my copy stays firmly at home, I still appreciate how easy it is to use. Recommended.
",0.95752936626,homeneeds,"I have a full sharpening set that comes with various whetstones, but it's nice to have a portable tool for quick sharpening jobs. I had one of the smaller utility sharpeners for kitchen use, but I found it didn't sharpen as well as a steel. Anyway, I thought this might be nice to include with my camping gear. I love the size and the ergonomics, and the lanyard hole is a great bonus. But how does it sharpen? Quite well. I ran my favorite kitchen knife through the coarse ""V"" a few times and then through the ceramic V. Oddly, I seem to get a sharper edge with the coarse metal V alone. Maybe it's my technique. (Also, the whole ""pivot"" thing eludes me.) In any case, it's a great sharpener and the price is killer. There's no reason not to buy two.
",0.8433353926,homeneeds,"Pocket Knife SharpenerManufacturer: Work SharpThis little sharpener is terrific. It sharpens with twin V-shaped convex carbide blades then hones with a pair of fine-grit ceramic rods. I could probably shave with my pocket knife after using this sharpener! There is also a diamond plate for sharpening or sanding smaller objects. I’m a hobbiest and tinkerer and this helps in so many ways. Also, if you’re a camper or enjoy fishing, pack one of these with your gear. There is a lanyard hole so that it can be hung for easy access.This revives dull paring knives quickly and as an experiment, I tried sharpening an X-acto blade. Good as new! This knife sharpener is a great value and would make a perfect gift. Highly recommended.

The top carbide sharper can be set to ridged or you can slide the red button to let this flex & drag while you sharpen your knife.  On the flip side of this are 2 ceramic rods for honing a sharpened blade.  The bottom also has 2 rubber feet to help hold this in place if you are using on a hard surface.  On one side is another sharpener you can use on your ax or fish hook.So far this has helped put an edge back on my pocket knife.

When this sharpener arrived, I was surprised at the size but following the direction proceeded to sharpen some of my knives that I use every day.  This gadget is very easy to use and after several times pulling the small knife across the sharpener, I tested it and noticed it becoming sharper.  After a few more swipes across the sharpener, I tested it and it sliced through with ease.  Now went to the second bigger knife and again the knife became sharper.Notice in my pictures it shows the ease of cutting into my items.  The large one with the bread amazed me as before it would mash the bread trying to cut through, this time it sliced through with ease.  This small little gadget has fine grit ceramic rods to hone the edge of your knife to a sharp cutting knife.  I cannot attest that it is back to factory sharpness but I am satisfied with how it works.  Now can keep my knives sharp all the time with this Work Sharp EDC knife sharpener.
",0.81684732427,homeneeds,"At first I had one out of the six lights not working but after some sunlight, it is now working. I've been using these around the backyard and ultimately chose these because of the quantity of units and for the reasonable price, I took a shot on these. So far, I'm pretty impressed with the lights. I love the front light switch and I'm able to make mode selections without removing the light like most other brands. Only defect so far is the brand sticker has come off on all of them. Other than that, I'm impressed it comes with 3M double sided tape and mounting hardware. Time will tell how long they hold up to the elements but so far so good. Oh, these are really small and can mounted on very small objects which is what I wanted these for.  Light output is okay, not the best but it suffices for what I need to light up. Yes, if you're looking directly at the light they are stupid bright but the actual light emitted to illuminate the area is decent. It's a tiny light so I cannot harp on them too much. Overall, if you're looking for good bang for your buck and need something small to light up a small area, these are your lights.

This is a good choice for people who have been lighting for a longer time to go off for 20 seconds. If you have been under the lights, it will not kill the smart products.

By far, this SEZAC product is the most sophisticated (3 modes), brightest (42 LED), and most economic (price-wise).  Tried to use it immediately and it worked right away with its factory stored energy.  The short manual may be modified slightly.  For new users, the first pushing of the black button turns on the device and leave it on mode 1. Pushing again then goes to mode 2 and so on.  Pushing the fourth times will turn off this device (i.e. back to the status when one receives it).

In the photo I have here, that was our pitch black closet with only the flashlight on.  It was like daylight.  Plus, it has a cool zoom feature.
",0.8047959829,homeneeds,"We keep these little flashlights around mainly for being able to pick up after our dogs during nighttime walks, so I purchase them whenever I see them at a decent price.  These things are amazing...even compared to similar flashlights that cost far more.  Not only are these little beacons bright as heck, but they're heavy duty and will, most likely, last a very long time.  Trust me, they're awesome!
",0.88651847829,homeneeds,"These are the best little flashlights I have bought in a long time. They are solid and feel very sturdy. They have a few different options on brightness. You can also untwist the top to get a zooming affect. If needed you could put it in your pocket. It's not a mag light, but its bright! We gave one to my dad and he also raved about how much he loved this little light.
",0.93965715229,homeneeds," Great little flash lights!!! They are super bright and I love the way the beam can be focused smaller. I keep one next to my front and back door to use when I take my dogs out. At this price I'll get 2 more for the vehicles.
",0.88941627729,homeneeds," Really bright. Small enough to fit on my purse but seems to be very durable. Good thing I got a two pack because my son won’t stop playing with one and if it can withstand him it can withstand anything. Lol.
",0.92752033529,homeneeds,"These are great! I love how you can adjust the light path from narrow to wide! Great size! I thought I would gift these. I changed my mind and decided to keep them! Nice packaging and shipped quickly! Thank you!
",0.98496079429,homeneeds,"Flashlights came in good condition a few days ago.  I put the batteries in one light and placed it on top of a cabinet while I went to work on the other light.  I bumped the cabinet and the first flashlight dropped about 6 and 1/2 feet onto a concrete floor.  The light still works fine.  Very happy with my purchase and thinking of buying more for stocking stuffers.
",0.19523325629,homeneeds,"I personally like these a lot. In my opinion, these are very sturdy and bright! I wanted something small and bright to leave in my cars for emergencies and these are perfect!
",0.82749962829,homeneeds,"Wow can’t say enough about these lights they will light up any room.  They are super bright yet compact to carry in purse or travel with.
",0.91425615529,homeneeds,"My husband loved these when he saw what I had ordered. Really nice heavy flashlights.
",0.81393653230,homeneeds,"Best smart lights I’ve ever bought. It is a great, high quality product which I can recommend to everyone. The setup couldn’t be easier and putting the lights on to the ceiling was also a lot easier that expected as well. I just bought 2 more sets to finish the whole room and I know it will look amazing because this is such a great product. Amazing job on making such a high quality product and I will definitely order a ton more from you guys.
",0.99322509830,homeneeds,"I originally bought another set of led lights to create a led sweatshirt for a music festival I'm going to, but unlike these the previous set couldn't connect to an app on my phone. These let me change the rhythm and color tone directly from my phone, which make my outfit look even better.

",0.85294389730,homeneeds," Ordered these LEDs to install in the door of my Wineador. LEDs arrived promptly and everything worked as they should except the remote which was broken.

The best I have seen yet.
",0.22820827430,homeneeds,"These lights are really good. They are bright, I will be buying more of these.
",0.96185576930,homeneeds,"Very good quality and lights up the entire kitchen.  I went ahead and ordered a second one for my bar area.
",0.87460732530,homeneeds,"I bought this LED Strip Lights for my daughter. This is very nice, we stuck it around the perimeter of the bed. This  LED Strip Lights has many varieties of lights of different colors, and also comes with a remote control, you can always customize the light to your mood!

I recommend a very cool, high-quality product!

",0.95472395430,homeneeds,"I wasn't expecting much, but these turned out to be pretty cool lights. Sure you can spend quite a bit more to get a little better product, but the app worked well and they do exactly what I wanted. Simple, responds well to what's on the screen and the phone app works. Fits the bill, with some money left in my pocket.
",0.89921164530,homeneeds,"Very good deal. Good colours and the adjustability is cool. The app is good also. Provides the ability to program sequences,fade and flash. The sound Sensing option works well.
",0.97383737631,homeneeds," This projector has many cool effects and you can customize the colors and motion easily. The laser projection is green and can either be on, off, or go through a fading sequence. The LED light can be blue, white, red or green or a combination of any 2 of those colors. You can have those lights stationary or moving at a few different speeds. There is also the option to go through fade patterns of the different colors. We don’t use sound but you could easily pair the device to a phone or other device to play relaxing sounds or music at night. My kids need the light on all night, but you can set them to turn off on a timer if you prefer. I love the effect of this projector. It is like looking at the northern lights. I particularly like the laser lights which add to the effect of a night sky. It is a very relaxing sight. The white color is pretty bright so we generally stick with blues and greens so the room isn’t too bright. It is one of the best night lights we have ever tried.
",0.94899475631,homeneeds,"my 10 yr old have anxiety and is hard for her to go to sleep at night, her Dr reccomend her a dim light in her room to create a peaceful ambiance, I found this night light and we Love it! since it have a music speaker we connect her music and it helps to sleep and the remote helps to turn off after she goes to sleep, will reccomend 100% plus shipping was super fast.

They love rainbows and unicorns and all that little girlie stuff so this is perfect for them.It blankets their ceiling with a star field and colored lights. The color lights change every few seconds and it’s a very fun effect. The nieces love it and it makes them happy and that’s what’s important.
",0.987830431,homeneeds," This was a great product which is very easy to use and had some amazing effects. I am just bummed that after only a month that the Red lighting effect no longer works. But all in all this is a very good product.
",0.92810726232,homeneeds,"I live in a small apartment about the size of a motel room. This little heater/fan is absolutely wonderful for my place! Set it on the floor and turn it on heat with the swivel action and it really warms up the entire room! The fan is perfect for just some airflow but it does not cool you off. If you’re wanting the fan to blow strong air it does not, but it is perfect for airflow in a comfortable temp room.
",0.76726818132,homeneeds,"Highly recommend this heater. Was looking for a compact heater for my bedroom to take the chill out of the air and this works perfectly. It's compact and easy to use and includes oscillation to distribute the heat evenly. I use it in the morning and it works very well.  I especially like how its quiet and has both 750 watt and 1500 watt settings which is great to save energy.
",0.93571150332,homeneeds," I ordered this because the heating in my apartment has been faulty and I’ve been waiting for it to get repaired. So my apartment has been freezing. My friend recommended this space heater and it’s honestly been a life saver! It warms up the whole room. You can choose on the dial how hot you want the hair. I also love that it oscillates, which is great for when multiple people are sitting in a room. Highly recommend
",0.14372205732,homeneeds,"This heater is compact but puts out a great amount of heat. I've used it in my bathroom and heats up super quick. I have another space heater but it's so large it barely fits anywhere, plus it's tall and awkward. This size is definitely much better.  It's nice to have the oscillating feature and temp controls. It also has a safety feature where if you lift it up it stops, which is good in case it gets knocked over. I'm happy with it. It will serve me well this winter.
",0.87918901432,homeneeds,"The best thing about this heater is there is no need to fear about power bills anymore. It produces very decent amount of heat good enough for a comfortable size room. Definitely recommend this product.
",0.76324713232,homeneeds,"I used it in the bathroom for my shower tonight. It’s not overly hot but just enough for the space I need. It’s safe for sure because I sat it on a wire cart to have the heat higher up and it refused to come on. I thought it was defective but tried it on the floor before I boxed it up. It came right on. I still have it on the cart but with a steady surface under it. I like that it has a fan only setting. That will be helpful in warmer weather
",0.81393134632,homeneeds,"already broken after 2 weeks... I need a refund.
",0.0414204932,homeneeds,"So, I really like this little heater. I've only needed it on the lowest heating setting so far (I just use it in my bedroom, not sure how well it work in my living room). It's helped me sleep better at night, good background noise and keeps me warm without feeling gross when I wake up. I've only run into one thing that was easily fixed - and that was the swing setting - basically when I woke up one time it had stopped turning, all it needed to go back to normal was to turn it off, unplug it, plug it back in, turn it and the turning setting back on. Also I did accidentally tip it once and it stopped. Once it was back to normal it started up again. So that's a good sign.
",0.14498841832,homeneeds,"I have purchased this space heater after lot reading of similar products and glad that my search result is great. I like this heater because of it’s feature and look.This heater is having three settings i.e. High Heat, Low heat and normal cool fan. These features helps a lot and we can use this heater is very cold, cold and normal whether as per our need.Alongside this heater is having adjustable thermostat which helps to maintain the temperature as per our comfort.It is having Swing start/stop button and as per our need we can adjust air swing.Although it is small in size it is much powerful and sufficient to provide heat in small room. Because it’s size it is portable and easy to carry from one place to another.I like the most it’s safety mechanism, it is having Tip-over protection i.e. it works only if it is having stable flat surface and it stops working automatically if we pick it or if it fall down accidently. I did not face any such overheat problem however as per Instruction guide, it provides overheat protection.Overall it is Amazing product and I recommend to my friends and family members.
",0.76130515332,homeneeds,"Got this for my small office room & this fits well.. Keeps the working area warm..The thing i like about it is the dual mode...You can use this as a desk fan too and it oscillates ...Its a good buy !!

",0.052602534,homeneeds,"I was using this to turn on/off a fluorescent grow light. After 3 days, the timer ceased functioning. I thought it was maybe a thermal circuit breaker but it never reset itself. I am working to return it. I thought ""GE"" & ""heavy duty"" meant something but I was mistaken. I would give this POS 0 stars if I could.
",0.11399647634,homeneeds,"I was hoping that the title of ""Heavy Duty"" meant that it would last longer than two months. I have purchased other brands of timers and thought this one would be different. This one is actually worse. I bought two of these and the first one started making noise after 2 weeks. The second one, after two months. The noise is a mechanical grinding that gets louder over time.  Other timers I have purchased, have had the same problem but after several years. I need something silent. I will keep looking.....
",0.13256484334,homeneeds,"Worked fine for the first month,and now it makes a weird scratching noise from the inside. Was totally silent for the first month. Anyone else with thia issue and is it a fire hazard?
",0.76416856134,homeneeds,"Didn't work.  I bought this specifically for the two plug option (I have several timers around my apartment and, now, for my Christmas lights on the balcony), but the timer did not work.  When I went on amazon to report it, I simply asked for a replacement and it's on its way to me, no charge, no having to take the other back.  I think that is very good customer service and I'm hoping the 2nd try will work!
",0.2349192834,homeneeds,"We bought this to replace a digital one that was only a couple of years old.  Have you ever been glad that a product stopped working?  The digital one was rather tedious to set.  Always had to refer back to the instruction sheet with fine print that Ant Man would have difficulty with.  After a couple of years, the display stopped working...... Yay!  So we went back to basics and bought this one.  Very easy to use and the dual outlet is very convenient.  We are using it indoors but it is nice to know that if we needed one outdoors, we could use this one in a pinch.
",0.89064943834,homeneeds,"I didn't really understand at first how I could be defeated by such a simple machine. after 1 day of use I discovered off is the pins pulled out so not really a circuit breaker kind of deal. If you want 8 hours of off time and 16 hours on; pull out 16pins in a line for that to happen.
",0.12552851434,homeneeds,"great old-fashioned light timer.  No fancy bells and whistles.  It turns the light on in the evening, off when I am in bed, and then on right before I get up and off after the sun comes up.  What more do you need?  I considered a more fancy timer, but why spend the money when you just need the lights to go on and off?
",0.7560878434,homeneeds,"This item is not available for returns, otherwise I'd be clicking on return item rather that writing a review. I am using the timer in a greenhouse in order to keep light on and optimal during the shorter days and longer nights. This timer turns on in middle of night, then off when it suppose to turn on, then it will shut off midday, and then back on when it is supposed to shut off. For me or anyone whose trying to use this timer fictionally, this timer it garbage. However, if you want it to not work properly, this timer does do that..
",0.534,homeneeds,"Unfortunately, this product was defective from the beginning.  It will not turn the lights on or off.  There is something wrong with the internal mechanism that controls the switch.  I have worked with several timers in the past and, althought this one looks sharp, it just did not work for me.

",0.99598109736,homeneeds,"This was a gift to my wonderful, hands-on father who swears he knows every trick to building anything... well little did he know this existed and finally for the first time in YEARS I was able to get him something that interests him and that he hasn't had before. These contour pieces shape perfectly to just about anything. It works similarly to those classic pin art toys, put your hand on it and it perfectly shapes to it but this actually has locking mechanism for function :)I expect he will be doing much less tracing and measuring now
",0.97257751236,homeneeds,"I saw this on a tv infomercial and immediately jump on amazon to buy, because who buys from infomercials! My husband and I like to do DIY projects in our house, but a lot of times I have to wait to for him to help with complicated cuts. This nifty little tool changes everything! I can trace a weird cut and do it on my own with less risk of messing it up. It does take some practice to figure out the best way to work, but pretty simple after you get the hang of it! Such a simple concept, too bad I didn’t think of it!
",0.79821944236,homeneeds,"I’ve seen these on fb ads and various other places. Hubs and I are laying flooring and needed to make precise cuts. Bought these for price.

This has been a life saver and our cuts look very professional since we had such a good guide with this gauge.

",0.86502736836,homeneeds,"They work great, very sturdy they pieces won’t move or slip from shape on their own. We use it for everything not just cutting shape but if we need a weird bolt or a rare tool shape then we press it in and go to the store to compare the shape. It’s uses are limitless!
",0.84160780936,homeneeds,"These contour gauges are great, they hold their shape nicely once conformed to an angle. I live in an old house and nothing is quite straight and we have lots of odd curves, this has really helped me capture those weird bends and make my cuts more accurate.

",0.09257653438,homeneeds,"I received this today and put it to good use on a project that I've been postponing.  In the past, I've used a ""pin type"" contour gauge - it worked well but was small and the pins tended to bent.  I though this design would be better and in many ways and it certainly is better.The two shortcomings (they do not effect my project, so I am happy)  are that the plastic feelers are a little stiff to move near the end of their range and, since they are wider than the pins on my other gauge, they a bit less accurate on the curve - again, this is not an issue for me, so I'm happy with the purchase.
",0.84981745538,homeneeds,"When I lay tile/wood/laminate flooring, the corners and special cuts are always the hardest.The old way, besides, guess and cut, would have me taking cardboard,and attempting to get the corners perfect, tracing them onto the cardboard, and then to the tile/plank.However, this way wasn’t always effective or efficient.This Contour Gauge toll changes that!This tool is so cool and a huge help!Made out of quality, strong material, this device easily gets me the corners and edges I need to cut.A small enough device to fit into my tool box, but big enough to get any corner/moulding cuts I need.The pictures posted show me getting the corner measurement I needed for tile!This device helps me check twice, cut once!Great device.Would highly recommend if you do any cutting!

I used this tool for cutting the right size for trims, since I am trying to add a piece of wood stick holding the position between two trims on each sides and make the transition looks more smoothly.The results is exactly as I want and fill the little gaps with caulk. Perfect I like it a lot, really nice design, I like it a lot! I am sure I will use it again!!!!!
",0.97896587838,homeneeds,"I bought this because I was building a custom shelf, but didn't want to damage the wall trim in my rented apartment. The gauge allows for easy measuring and scribing of the trim's precise shape. You can see the results in the photos.Also super useful if you need to cut tile around pipes or other unever objects. I expect this will come in handy for all sorts of projects.I've seen metal versions of these, but I think this one is actually better in terms of holding onto the shape.
",0.86888921338,homeneeds,"Bought this because this is will be a great tool for me to do replace the carpet to hardwood flooring. Especially when you lay the laminate to the corner, you can use this contour gauge to cut the perfect shape that fits the corner. It’s a pretty handy tool if you like to DIY at home. Helps you cut the exact fit materials. And the price is amazing cheap on amazon. I think this is a great buy.
",0.94246774938,homeneeds," I bought this for the purpose of getting those tight corners when installing flooring. It worked like a dream. With this contour tools ease of use I was able to make the installation look almost professional.Overall the price is fair and it served the exact purpose I sought out to do. The build quality is also really solid. If definitely purchase again.
",0.89553511138,homeneeds,"This contour gauge is great.  It's 10 inches which is bigger than most I have found.  It works beautifully for measuring out a door threshold when putting down flooring, and also for sizing pipes when doing drywall.  It's a simple device, but saves a lot of time measuring and drawing out cuts on a floor/drywall and makes the project go much faster!  Highly recommend this device.
",0.93901193139,homeneeds,"The adhesive on the back of the strip makes it easy to mount anywhere. I chose to mount it on the small wooden underside of my bed frame, where it has yet to sag after a week now, appearing to be strong. The inclusion of two light strips is nice, but is only really useful if you want an extremely long singular strip. If you choose to use them separately, you must purchase another wall plug and transformer. Otherwise, the value proposition is alright and it does what it needs to well.
",0.19689503339,homeneeds,"The lights are beautiful, easy to put up. I would have given 5 stars, but the sticky on the back came off and I had to buy double sided tape to make them stay. Other than that, my daughter loves them.
",0.77597153239,homeneeds,"Very simple and easy to apply under my camper. Be sure to order the clips to aid in keeping them where you stick them. The remote allows you to choose many colors and blink patterns. Definitely will buy a couple more sets to trim the rest of my camper.
",0.90212643139,homeneeds,"I haven't finished my  design yet but the lights were what I was looking for. Amazing quality for the price! Everything works very well. It go like the waterproof set. Easy set-up. Flat top and bright LED's with a decent range between red green and blue in colors. This is much nicer than the picture. Pretty impressed with this
",0.9919085539,homeneeds,"Just installed this  - desperately needed under-cabinet lighting in the kitchen. So far it’s great! I can finally see in the kitchen while i’m cooking and not that much difficulty with installation. They are BRIGHT and can be dimmed as well as use various colors. Overall, I love this and I was very impressed
",0.92216700339,homeneeds,"The quality of this lamp is very good, the light is very bright, cheap and durable, the lighting effect is very good, the bar is good, the brightness is also very good, the price can buy such a good quality is worthwhile.

",0.99774229539,homeneeds,"Love it
",0.99480044840,homeneeds," installed as soon as I received it. looks amazing. it does change colors but all I needed is ONE color. Bam! The store looks neat. I don't like to brag about things i get but this one is actually..nice!!
",0.87587630740,homeneeds,"These LEDs are worth every dollar!  The music sync feature is amazing.  And the LED's are vibrant and I had no problems with the adhesive.
",0.97901356241,homeneeds,"This drill bit is very flexible. It helps me out when I’m stuck at some angles or when I need extra length to reach a deep point. Simple to use and works very well.
",0.21417945642,homeneeds,"Good quality multi-tool works. Everything seems to be working pretty good for a small tool.  The only thing I could not pull a large nail using the tool because of leverage so too short. I was not strong enough to remove it but small nails came out.  I do worry that black color looks stylish but paint might come off during a long time of usage.
",0.7792508642,homeneeds,"This is a great present idea for a dad. My wife wanted to give a little thank you present for her dad, so we found this multitool. Her dad was extremely happy. He likes that it comes with a lot of different tools and a storage pouch so he can keep it in his car. It looks sturdy and is compact enough for storage.
",0.9837990442,homeneeds,"A great multi-tool to keep in the house. I use this a lot for when I don't go to my garage and dig through all my tools. The hammer is solid for use.  This would also be great to keep in the car for emergency needs as well.
",0.80661714142,homeneeds,"This small hammer looks so much better in person than it does in the pictures. It is small but it will still drive a nail through a wall. The pliers part of these are strong enough to pull out old nails, staples and for twisting wire. The wire cutters are sharp and strong enough to trim electrical wires. The knives on these are very sharp and was even able to trim drywall with these. The handle on this fits in my hand and is a lot stronger than what it looks like in the picture. The handle for the pliers has a really good grip on it and prevents it from slipping out. My favorite part of this tool is the engraving on the side.
",0.78126692842,homeneeds," I love this products.  It’s durable, strong, compact and just plain cool.  I love how it has the major tools I need all in one.  It’s easy to use and I just plain love it.  It’s definitely a great gift.  I strongly recommend this to anyone wanting to give a gift.  Only downfall I would say is it’s geared towards dads/men.  Us ladies could definitely benefit from having a product like this. I would recommend removing the wording which will open this product up for anyone to buy.  All in all, a great product.  I gave this to my hubby.
",0.97457611642,homeneeds,"This product surprised me! We purchased this as a gift for my father-in-law. First impression was the weight - it was much heavier than I had expected. It seems to be very well-built. Another pleasant surprise was the beautiful carrying case. From the images online, I wasn’t sure if the black sleeve would be something just discarded and unused but no, this is a solid case that is ultra-durable. I imagine my father-in-law will always store it in the case. Overall very happy with the product and feel it could have easily been priced $5-$10 more expensive than it is.
",0.81073927942,homeneeds,"Don't waste your money on this!I definitely don't see 14 different usable tools on this thing. And I was very disappointed that the Philip's head screwdriver is tiny, more jewelry sized and definitely useless for standard sized screws. Also, the knife and saw are really dull, not sure what you'd be able to cut through with those.I emailed customer service about my concerns and disappointments and haven't heard anything back.
",0.0229445142,homeneeds,"I originally bought this for my dad. But when i opened it, I decided to keep it for myself lol. I work in a factory and this little gadget comes in handy. I actually used it tonight. Its light and durable and everything functions as it should. I’ve had other multi tools. But this one is alittle different. It has locks so when you try to use one of the tools it doesn’t fold.
",0.89071357342,homeneeds,"This tool is small but mighty! It has so many tools within it and was the perfect tool for my dad. He loves the multi tool aspect of it and uses it often. It’s compact enough to keep in a drawer in the house or even carry in his back pocket when needed. It is durable and has already withstood a lot of work.
",0.84219217342,homeneeds,"This tool seems to be made pretty well. My husband is excited to take it hunting with him! He said it is nice because a lot of similar tools are hard to get the tools out of but this one is easy to get them out. The best dad writing ever makes it a nice gift!
",0.97836625643,homeneeds," ""Wow, these are very cool lights!"" said my daugther and I have to agree. We had purchased a set of strip lights from another seller and theirs wouldn't stay attached compared to this one. Many other advanges over the competition, which are:We like that they come with a remote control. The lights shine better and brighter, just an overall better quality. You don't have to plug/unplug the lights to get them turned on. Imagine inconvenient placement of outlets where you have to crawl to get them plugged in. No more, just push the button to turn them on. Super easy to use.These lights are perfect for entertainment, hanging them in a kids room under the bunk bed or just to light up an area you don't have much light. I'm very happy with the quality and I will surely buy some more.Remember the Holidays are coming up, great use would be to decorate a window and have the lights change with your favorite tune. So many other uses possible, just use your imagination.Great quality for a great price. I will order more shortly.
",0.96935784843,homeneeds," These LED strip lights are awesome!  Easy to install with a multi purpose remote, And provide great music lights sparkling.

",0.99699437643,homeneeds," Amazing! These are so cool. My kid love them. We put them up at the top of the wall all around the room. They can be very bright but also fades to any dimness.

Video submitted is led light mounted under my counter top inside of my camper plan on ordering more for sure!
",0.96196472643,homeneeds," I have purchased these LED strip lights for my halloween dinner. I will be having a barbecue with my friends and family. Although the lights are not waterproof and I am using them outside, they are covered by my back porch so everything is fine and they're working great. They were quite easy to install, came with a remote control and I've placed them all around the mirror, right next to my bar. I am happy with the way they look and I can't wait to be using them on my Halloween party.

",0.89102721243,homeneeds,"Definitely really cool to have and makes the room look so cool. When it comes to adhesion, it is really good the first time you put it up but if you need to adjust it, you need to use tape or something to hold it up for awhile because it is worn out.

",0.90453648644,homeneeds,"Wow! This is one of practical gadgets I have.  There are many different functions I can utilize.  It basically is an outlet adapter which you get 2 extra power outlets and 3 USB outlets. In addition, you can power on and off with the switch button. There are a night light and large shelf on the top to hold your electronics. Moreover, there are 2 holders on each side which you can hold your cables or earphone. Very nice touch. This is a very well designed charging station.
",0.97695851344,homeneeds,"Who would believe that you can get excited about an outlet expander?! This outlet strip that has a shelf attached  on top and also 3 USB ports added. I thought it wouldn't be too useful until I started using it. The shelf is what makes this outlet expander stand out from the others, it is not only looks good and it works great.  I can just prop it up in the kitchen when I need my devices for recipes or watch video. It doesn't take up any valuable cover top space.However, the shelf can only be attached by the top, if it can be attached on both top and bottom, I think it would really a be perfect outlet expander.I’m going to get one for my husband as Christmas gift now. He had been struggling to find a place for his Alexa in our room and I believe this outlet expander will make him very happy.Trust me this little thing well make a difference!

I love the outlets on the side the most, so I can still have our air freshener plugged in and use the blow dryer while have a place to put my phone and not accidentally bump it off the counter.
",0.86370199944,homeneeds,"Often my family travels with 3 laptops and 4 iPhones. As you can imagine, this definitely cause anxiety when every family is battery hungry after a whole day usage. Worry no more, with this plug, everyone can get electrical juice to their lovely devices.The AC plug in the back of the device splits into three AC outlets in the front making this device useful for a travel family even at home. The LED light in the front uses less than 1W and with sensor that can be set to Auto-Off-On modes. This LED is perfect for using it in the night and / or dark environment. At the bottom, there are three USB output that can be used to charge enough devices along with the use of laptops.I strongly recommend any one who does not currently have such a multi-function outlet. And I am planning to purchase another one for home use as well.

I walked into the bathroom and immediately saw the outlet smoking.  The on/off button melted.  Super upset.  Thank God it did not ruin my new $100 electric toothbrush or my electrical outlet!!!!  :((
",0.83666729945,homeneeds,"At first impression, the thing is light and cheaply made--all plastic. But it functions well, and does exactly what it is intended to do. I don't know if every item off the assembly line is as tight as this one, but the pins move easily when pressure is applied at corners, etc., and it holds its shape when transferring to a surface for templating. It can easily copy any shape, creates an instant template for curved and odd-shaped profiles simply and easily. LAMBOR STUDIOS contour gauge duplicator can be used to locate profiles or edges and accurately transfer to the material to be cut. For any kind of work needs the contour duplication. In woodworking, auto body, auto metal sheet, stainless steel or any job of contour duplication. If treated well and not tossed into a toolbox with heavy equipment, I expect this item will last for many years. It's not that the plastic if fragile; it is fairly heavy gauge and could be dropped without much fear of shattering or chipping, but plastic is plastic. I'd buy again.

",0.21743160546,homeneeds,"While the instructions for the hardware are sparse, setup is quite simple.  To connect the LED strip to the controller you make sure the LED side of the strip is facing the same direction as the button on the controller.  If you get it backwards it will light up weird.  If that happens just flip the connection and you should be all good.  The LED strip uses 2.4ghz WiFi (Not compatible with 5ghz).  Once connected to the Gosund app you can then connect it to your Google Assistant or Home speakers, or your Amazon Alexa smart speakers to control the LED strip with your voice.  You can turn them on and off, change the color and the brightness of the LED strip with your voice.  The app gives you some additional options such as pre-programmed color scenes and music mode.  Music mode uses a mic in the controller to change the color and flash the LED lights.  To exit Music Mode you just change the color of the LED strip.  The app also gives you a schedule option, where you can have the strip turn on and off based on the time (The timer accuracy is +- 30 seconds).  The color can not be set for the timer, it uses the color that you last had it on.  This LED strip defaults to on when it is powered off then back on.  Which is perfect for behind your TV.  You can also use this LED strip to light up your 3D Printer and any other small area you want.
",0.78095829546,homeneeds,"I've been looking to get some lights for 55"" TV for awhile and came across these led lights from Tan Tan. These came in a small box with instructions, roll of lights (9.2 ft), usb control box and extra adhesive strips. The lights have 3M adhesive on the back to stick whatever you want. I found the middle of the strip and wrapped it around a small edge I found on my TV. Worked perfectly.Connecting to the wifi was easy. Just make sure your phone (or tablet) is using 2G (not 5G) wifi connection. I was able to use Smart Life app, which I was using for my other automated devices,  to connect to the light strip. My Amazon Echo Dot automatically found the device and I was able to control it with Alexa voice commands.Overall this has been exactly what I expected.  The features all work as advertised.
",0.546,homeneeds,"I’ve often thought about installing a backlight for my bedroom TV, so I purchased this product because it was the right length for my needs, integrates with Google Home and appeared to be easy to install.My TV is not very large and the light strip was long enough to be installed around the backside rim of my TV. Once installed, setup was simple and I was easily able to get it connected to Google Home. And that was it. Now I enjoy the colorful backlight to my TV which really makes it pop.
",0.90690612846,homeneeds,"First I used tape  in the general place I liked them, checked all my gaps around the tv and locations of the first/last LED bulb in each row in relation to the opposite side to make sure they were even. I left it like that for a day or 2 to make sure everything was good and today I did the permanent install. The sensor MUST be exposed for the remote to work. Place the tapes within 4 inches of the edge of the TV for the best effect, the closer to the edges, the better. As far as brightness, this strip is more than bright  to backlight my 55"" tv and really helps with night viewing.

Very safe, no leakage, and affordable.

When I first got these lights, I was a little worried that it would be difficult to untangle the many strands of lights. However, when we got them they were nicely wrapped and each individual strand was twist tied--simple and free of tangles.I  wanted a blue color effect on curtains, by using this warm white fairy lights to contrast with the cold white fairy lights (a different product that I own) it came out blue perfectly. It gave my curtains a nice starry/snowy effect.

I ordered two sets for my 8 foot tree, (600 lights) the bulbs are smaller than the standard Christmas light bulb but still do a fantastic job! I love the different settings as well.  The only downside is the connection between sets is different so the star at the top of my tree needed and extension cords as opposed to attaching to the last string of lights, but that was unexpected but easy fix.

",0.95492893549,homeneeds,"This is for the 100W equivalent warm white bulbs rated at 1500 lumens.  Upon installing the first one, it was obvious to me that it wasn't as bright as an incandescent 100W bulb.  I took the light meter app on my phone and measured a 100W incandescent bulb and got a reading of 1430 lumens and a color temperature of 2900 Kelvin.  Substituting these LED bulbs, I got a lumen reading of just 950 and a color temperature of 2800.  That's over 1/3 less than the rated output and so I tried several out of the box of 16 and got very similar readings.I then went to the local big box store and bought a name brand 100W equivalent LED bulb.  Physically, the bulb is quite a bit bigger and the light output was a whopping 1470 lumens at 2900K color temperature.  This was what I expected from the Amazon branded bulbs so was disappointed.  I did check the markings on the bulbs to make sure I didn't get the 75W equivalent and no, these were supposed to be 100W equivalent.This is the first Amazon branded product that I have been disappointed in - clearly they did not quality test these bulbs before branding them and selling them.
",0.549,homeneeds,"I put them in my kitchen fixtures. They are SO different than my usual more golden color. They made the room look white/blue bright, very awful aura and not comfortable for me at all, and took them (6) right out. I don't know what I did wrong in choosing them. I am putting them in my outdoor fixtures. Not a comforting light for me. I tried ordered a warm LED but idiot California will not ship to me in this State. Some new law again....Maybe the 100 watt is too much. I want my 'warm' light back!!! Where are you warm LED's??? Wish I could change out the politicians in California so easily...
",0.03838029549,homeneeds,"From my usage, the bulbs (100W Equivalent, Daylight, Non-Dimmable, 10,000 Hour Lifetime, A19) have a lot of positive features:+ Speced at 100W Equivalent (15W, 1500 lumen).+ A19 'normal' light bulb size (many 100W Equivalent are larger A21 sized).+ Usable/safe in enclosed light fixtures (per a response from the manufacturer in the ""Customer questions & answers"" section).+ In my garage door opener, they do not seem to add any interference that decreases remote range.+ The Daylight 5000K color temperature seems accurate and they are not noticeably blue 6500K LEDs trying to be passed off as ""5000K"".+ So far I have not noticed any hum.I have found it difficult at this time to find LED bulbs in the ~1500 lumen range that are both A19 sized and safe to use in enclosed fixtures, so that is a big win.But there are some cons:- Non-dimmable (minor con and they are clearly labeled as such, but it would make them more multi-purpose).- 80+ CRI (again per the manufacturer in the ""Customer questions & answers"" section); 90+ would be nice.And the biggest con for me by far:-- There is a noticeable green tint to my eyes.This may be the cause of some of the negative reviews that call the 100W Daylight version 'harsh'.  As I understand it, this is common with many currently available 4000~5000K LEDs, especially when they are driven at lower currents to keep them cool and efficient.As I was planning on using these for garage (supplemented by some nice 4000K LED lights) and outdoor (covered) lighting, this isn't a major deal breaker for me.  However, I did use some for interior lighting to see how they worked; I am definitely not a fan for this usage.Still, 1500 lumen/A19/safe in enclosed fixtures may bring me back for interior lighting, but I would definitely choose the Soft White (2700K) version instead.
",0.549,homeneeds,"I purchased these for my boyfriend after nagging him for 3 weeks to replace the burned out lights in his ceiling fan to no avail. He was using his desk light instead (because that's clearly an adequate substitute).I lost patience with his promises to grab them ""next time he was out"" after the 6th time he failed to deliver and took matter into my own hands. Amazon prime 2 day shipping to the rescue. I purchased the 75W equivalent lights and screwed them in. There wasn't any delay with the lights having to warm up, and the three I screwed in all worked right off the bat. I came back later to find my boyfriend unscrewing one bulb complaining that they ""worked too well"" and were too bright.Even with one bulb taken out, the room is very well lit and the soft white is pleasant and warm, but not too yellow (which is important since I do my makeup in the room).I also noticed that the bulbs don't seem to heat up like the old ones did, which was a nice bonus since I've burned my fingers before.I'll update this review if anything happens, but for the past few weeks, so far, so good

",0.94539320551,homeneeds," It expands one 3-prong outlet to 3 more 3-prong outlets.  It is constructed very well, graded for up to 15 Amps, the max of most home circuits, and is exactly what you would expect.  A few interesting things are the orientation of the outlets.  Make sure they face in the direction that works for you.  If you have big AC adapters that require more space, all 3 will not fit, and the left most side will fit only a standard plug due to it facing inward towards the wall.  Also, the UL certification sticker is on the top (assuming your ground wire is on the bottom) and is noticeable if you didn't want a sticker on top.  It is exactly what I need.It is kind of bulky, has a sticker on top, and is oriented in directions that might or might not suit you.  But for me it is oriented perfectly, constructed very well, supports 15A and nice rigid connections, and is great.

",0.551,homeneeds,"We rearranged our kitchen counter so we have a group of appliances in one area, but we are short on outlets so I decided to buy the GE Grounding Triple Tap. These are an easy and inexpensive solution, and we can now plug-in three small appliances per outlet. We're using one for our electric kettle, toaster and blender, and it works perfectly. The appliance plugs fit snug, but all fit just right with a little push. I like that they fit snug and aren't going to inadvertently get pulled out. I'm also using one in the bedroom, and haven't had any issue with a plug not fitting properly. Aesthetically, I like the low profile and also that the white color blends in well with our white outlet covers. These look a little different than the picture as they have a slight indentation at the top of each corner, as you can see in the picture I'm posting. The GE Grounding Tap is an inexpensive solution when you're short on outlets, and it's a very good product that I recommend.
",0.92744821351,homeneeds,"This is great I currently use it to keep all my cords together for my fish tank! I will probably purchase another one
",0.92044550251,homeneeds,"I put this in my work bag for when there is only a single outlet for me. It comes in handy when everyone is trying to charge off the same outlet in a meeting or at the airport as well. The desks at the hotel rarely have the 3 plugs I need for all my bricks.
",0.23479402151,homeneeds,"I purchased this because I'm always finding that I need more 3 prong outlets for my numerous grounded electric devices. My preference was to use one of the swivel type 3 prong adapters that I already own, but the problem with those, is that while they have three outlets, they're so close together that its impossible to utilize all of them. This is especially true when attempting to put in larger transformer type plugs that come with items such as cordless phones, hair dryers, etc. What I'd like to see, would be a swivel type adapter that offers more space between sockets, but so far I've been unable to locate one.This particular grounded outlet does enable you to use all 3 of the sockets, and it does work as advertised. My reason for deducting one star, is based on the lack of a swivel design. This makes it impractical if you want to place something, such as a mattress directly flush with the wall. If that's not an issue, than this outlet works just fine.
",0.08291572351,homeneeds,"I travel 40-42 weeks/year, and I'm always looking for neat little tools and gadgets to make life on the road easier.  This little plug works very well!  The picture in Amazon doesn't show it, but this is a GROUNDED plug.  In other words, it has three posts.  It is not an ungrounded (two prong) to grounded (three prong) conversion.  As long as you know that's what you are getting, this is a great little three plug expander.
",0.89503681751,homeneeds,"As you can see in the pictures, in my house all of the pluggers are horizontal, but that was inconvenient for aromatizers and electric candle burners, but now with my cube it's all in the past!!It works perfectly. Came early, so I'll say service is good. I have nothing else to ask for! Amazing!
",0.83388507451,homeneeds,"I have a number of 3 prong outlets, mostly a lot older, all side by side ones. Well in today's world of converters, those large step down plugs don't allow placing next to each other. So a older side-by-side 3 prong only allows typically 2 things even if only one is a step down plug.With this one, because of it's design, I can get 2 step downs plugged into the sides and a regular plug in the end.And depending on the step down size, you can get 3 if they don't overhang the end.It seems to stay plugged in pretty good, no real wiggle or looseness.The only down side is it sticks out pretty far. Keep this in mind if you are trying to put it behind something, like a night stand or dresser, sofa, things like that. You most likely will not be able to push the item as close to the wall as you did before using this. That could be a limiting factor. But I have one behind my night stand, which I could move the nightstand over a few inches, and then this was beside the back and worked fine. Lifes little first world problems. A cordless phone, a Bluetooth Speaker and a Google Home mini all sharing one plug. All three with step down plugs.Just keep in mind what you need this for and where it will be located.
",0.70813906251,homeneeds,"Incredibly convenient! I had it hooked up to my travel adapter while backpacking through the UK, and was able to consistently charge my phone, camera, and external portable battery pack each and every night. No issues, worked like a charm! Great for the price.A couple of special things to note about it, also:The plugs are offset so that if you have a 2-plug outlet, you can use two of these and have access to all 3 outlets on each tap. Very convenient behind a TV entertainment center so you don't have wires and power strips going everywhere.Each outlet on the tap has a ground so even high output items like vacuum cleaners will work.The ground holds the tap in place very well so you don't need to worry about the tap falling out of the outlet while you are using it even with three heavier items plugged in.
",0.80565917552,homeneeds,"I loved it! The whole entire month it worked. Conveniently it stopped working a week after it's (30day) return policy expired. I unplugged it from it's cord and pressed the bottom button (spotlight) and it lit up perfectly, so I pressed the button again and nothing. So thinking I pressed the wrong button I pressed the top button and the side light came on. So I pressed the top button again and nothing. Now both light are on and neither button is working. I even held down the buttons (which activates the strobe & blue/red light options) and nothing. I just set it down and let the battery died out to turn it off.Hopefully the company (or Amazon) will do the right thing and send me another one (and a prepaid shipping label so I can send them the broken one).Overall a excellent light. More than I expected and the shipping was fast too. I think I just got a ""bad one"". I still will recommend even though it was such a quick romance.UPDATE! The company notified me through Amazon in under an hour after I left the comments above. They asked me to return their email with my invoice number and address. So I did. Instantly I got an email back from them saying a new one was on the way and because I had asked about getting a second one they gave me a V.I.P. purchase package with a 40% off my next light.Kool.

The thing I really like about it is that it is rechargeable and I do not have to keep a ton of batteries on hand. I keep it in my bedroom so I know exactly where it is in a state of emergency.I was a little puzzled about the tripod in the box, but then thought about it and believe it can come in handy so you don’t have to hold it for long periods of time i.e. If youre camping, dark house, etc.

Be careful cause you can blind yourself with how bright they are!! They stay charged for a long time too. We charged it when we got it and my husband has used it for a couple hours each night and it's still going strong.  My husband is extremely satisfied with it and he's a hard one to please.  The price is great as well cause we have brand name lights that cost double and are very heavy and not as bright.

",0.91824674653,homeneeds," This laser pointer is so incredibly awesome. I just shopped for an affordable laser to use when we go to Alaska and get the most clear skies. I originally bought it as a stocking stuffer for a family member, but I love it so much that I think I'm going to buy another for them and keep this one. This has a rechargeable battery, it can do your most common laser which just looks like a green dot somewhere...or you can have it do multiple dot designs. It has an extra lens that makes multiple dots to form squares, diamonds, and other shapes. It is so beautiful. I'm a grown woman playing with a laser gun! So unexpected to enjoy it as much as I do. Buy this and become a kid again!
",0.97020393653,homeneeds,"This thing is bright! I mean, I was looking for a simple laser to entertain my dog (bugz) when we go out hiking, this is overkill. This has better, more practical, applications (of course) than my intended use. There is an added sense of security since it can be used as an emergency sos for when I’m out in the woods. It comes in what reminds me of a little green military box with Cushing material on the top and bottom. The pointer itself feels premium since it has a nice heft to it. There is also a helpful lock mechanism which prevents little wondering hands from playing with it.Overall, I’m glad I purchased due to the many other applications I’ve found for this thing!
",0.93281108153,homeneeds,"I've always had some sort of laser pointer . . . oddly enough to use as a pointer.  But they're also marginally useful to establish a straight line or as a reference point to determine a drop or rise from level.  But I managed to misplace my old red one and so . . .This thing is astonishingly bright, I've used it outdoors in full daylight.  You may as well lose that little pattern thing on the front; not sure what the point of it is.  And I didn't think the little keyed lock would matter, but it does - I am grateful that you can't turn it on accidentally.  The lock has been criticized as being flimsy and that's true, but be careful and it will do the trick.I'm amazed that you can see the beam indoors - we have a air purifier and the beam  shows you how much dust and junk you still have in the air.  Outdoors, it's like holding a light saber - be careful with it.Can't say I have a lot of serious uses for it, but it does lots of odd and interesting things.  For example, I now EXACTLY what's on my side of the property lines and what isn't - I find that I have less lawn to mow.  Cool.
",0.75758659853,homeneeds,"This laser light is great! Super strong, very bright at night as well as during the day.

Comes in a zip pouch, too, so I have a place to store it.  No weird smells from the filter or the material.  If it was just a bit more fitted (see below), I'd give it five stars, but it's a good, solid mask. (If I could figure out how to, I'd give it a 4.5...)Caveats, I'm at the end of the velcro around the back of my neck, so it feels a little odd-lots of material back there, but I'm a smaller person, so if you're petite, be prepared for that.

Don't know if I'd want to wear it working outside, though, 'cause my glasses and the bridge-seal do argue a bit over who sits where... Less of an issue in my studio when I'm wearing my optivisor.

",0.82851922554,homeneeds,"I've become deathly allergic to grasses, and now, with this mask, I can mow my lawn safely and happily!  This is the second mask I've tried.  The first mask I tried was a neoprene bicycler mask I bought from a local bike shop.  It worked slightly, but was terribly hot and uncomfortable (and I don't mind neoprene, because I used to do a lot of water sports).  THEN I bought the BASE CAMP mask, and wow, what a difference!  It's a LOT better then those neoprene ones.  The BASE CAMP mask is a solid mesh (not a few tiny hole in the neoprene) so I can breath a lot easier, and the entire filter is utilized.I takes me about an hour to prep and mow my yard.  By the end of that hour, the filter is saturated with sweat, but I feel great.  Before I started using this BASE CAMP mask, I would mow my lawn and 1-2 hours later I was throwing up, running-out-both-ends, and had severe gut cramps and I had difficulty breathing, and it would take me 24 hours to recover.  Along with wearing the mask, I take, and hour or two before I mow, a Benadryl, and Xzyal and a Singulair pill to help me survive the ordeal. Before I started wearing the BASE CAMP mask, the pills only helped me not end up in the ER.  Now, along with my meds and the BASE CAMP mask, I mow the lawn and work in the yard, and afterwards its like nothing happened!  I feel great, healthy and normal!  This BASE CAMP mask is a god-send!  It's saving my life!!!  Thank you Amazon and BASE CAMP (I think BASE CAMP is an Amazon company).
",0.13667073854,homeneeds,"I bought this mask a couple weeks ago and wanted to put it through its paces before reviewing. I work in commercial construction and needed this primarily for extended times spent ripping boards on the table saw and the sometimes frequent cutting of cultured stone sink tops using an angle grinder with cut off wheel. Very dusty!Fit was ideal for my face. I have a narrow face and a slightly pronounced bridge on my nose so the bendable nose piece was a key feature for me. The ability to limit breathing wood saw dust particles was above adequate in my opinion. The cultured marble dust which is basically the consistency of talcum powder was moderate. If you are looking for zero inhalation of any particles, buy a respirator. It's that simple folks. I use respirators when cutting materials over an extended period of time that release finer particles. That's just common sense.So what is this mask ideal for? For me it's the convenience of the quick on and off feature of using the hook and loop strap. Some days I'm constantly back and forth making cuts that the traditional disposable masks are too much of a PITA to deal with since I'm required to wear a hard hat and tethered safety glasses all day. Walking around with the paper masks snugged under my chin with two elastic bands digging into my neck is not my thing. So the ability to quickly add and remove this mask is great.The overall effectiveness of the filters seem to be very good at this point. I can breath freely and have limited fogging of my safety glasses. A small adjustment of the glasses usually is sufficient to keep from fogging.Overall I think the Base Camp is a great mask for the price point compared to the RZ which is considerably more, although I cannot say whether it is better or not since in fairness I have never tried the RZ.Be realistic about your needs. If you are highly sensitive to fine dust particles, use a respirator. If you are like me and have probably already done more damage to your lungs than you care to think about over the last 25 years in the trades, and simply want to greatly reduce any further damage, than give this a try. It may be all that you need.
",0.81363213154,homeneeds,"My husband has been looking for a dust mask recently because he does a lot of work outdoors. We have a lot of animals and dirty spaces to clean on our land.My husband has used this mask several times since we got it earlier this week. He has used it mostly while cleaning out the chicken coops. We have a very large chicken coop and then a smaller coop we using for brooding chickens in. He cleans it out often normally but the last time he cleaned it was a couple of months ago so he had to do some heavy-duty cleaning this time. He cleaned some of it with vinegar and a pressure washer and the mask really helped keep debris away and from him inhaling cleaning solution and the mess that chickens make.As you can see from the photos, he has a pretty long and thick beard and even with that, the mask fits perfectly and pretty flush against his face. It is very comfortable to him and adjusts easily.He looks forward to wearing this mask again this fall when he has to chop up leaves in the yard. The debris from the leaves usually really mess with his sinuses so hopefully, this mask will help a lot with that.
",0.77618265254,homeneeds,"I use dollar-store paper masks when I'm cutting or sanding wood, or working with stains or seals that have a lot of fumes. I really like that I've found a mask with better comfort that is reusable. It comes with 6 extra filters, so that makes 7 total including the pre-installed one.Upon testing this out I realized this will also come in handy around Halloween, so I guess there are good multi-purposes here.
",0.91837298954,homeneeds,"I am sooooo happy with this. I was recently in urgent care because I got something in my eye leaf blowing. I bought a DeWalt eye protection. My sunglasses fit inside!!!  It is super easy to put on and it IS comfortable. This Base Camp face mask is super easy to put on with replaceable filters. I can not get over how easy to breath it is wearing it. The wrap around for the ears work great. So I am set to work inside w my wood carving and burning and my outside gardening. Very happy and surprised how comfortable both items are.
",0.90537881954,homeneeds,"I used surgical cotton masks before, but the backlash of my breathing kept on coming back to by face. So I decided to try this mask instead. I have to say they are really wonderful. Allows me to breathe in/out much better than any other masks I have worn in the past.  Excellent quality. Well worth the price.Pros:LightweightFits snug on faceFilters out particlesAdjustable VelcroAround the ear loopsWashableGood for allergiesCons:I look like Kylo Ren from star wars or some other villain when wearing it in public.*******Well made and has outstanding air flow. This mask is mainly for construction, demolition, sanding, lawn mowing, woodworking, painting, cleaning basements, etc. Not for OSHA type requirements, fumes, contaminants, viruses.Can be easily washed when filers are removed.
",0.92865157154,homeneeds,"I've been in the restoration trade over 40 years. The general single use dust masks were OK and the higher end masks were used for the nasty stuff. Of course I used a respirator mask when needed. When this style of reusable mask came out, yes, it looked kool, but I liked that it could be reused and had replaceable filters. I bought the other brand, and tried using it. But it fit awkward and the strap felt like it was always pulling my head down, very uncomfortable, I didn't want to use it at all. I just couldn't get it to fit and feel comfortable, it was painful in minutes. I just happened to see this Base Camp mask and noticed the ear hooks and the general shape of it looked better. I got one to see if it's an improvement over the other one. BIG difference! Fit well and the ear hooks are a huge plus. I can wear this all day. Glad I took a chance. They took a good mask idea, and made it a lot better.
",0.7895388654,homeneeds,"Disclaimer: I didn’t buy this item because I needed it for keeping out pollutants. Nope. I bought it for my favorite holiday - HALLOWEEN! 😂 however, as someone who loves to write product reviews, I will review it as the item is meant to be intended for use.My first impression when putting on the mask was “wow, adjustable nose.” This was great to shape to my not-generic nose and create a tight seal with the mask. The mask is just big enough to seal at my nose, and also cup just under my chin. Snug seal.The mask came with extra carbon filters, this will be great to run in the LA canyons without worrying about the dirt kicked up into the air by runners and hikers ahead of me - something that is very common here. The valves themselves can be removed and replace as well as the mask ages.Now for the fun part: this mask is shaped a bit like a gas mask, and was a perfect fit for what I’m considering for Halloween: a Mad Max-style apocalyptic costume. Unfortunately, in my excitement, the only photo that I took of the mask was after I adhered it to my face and drew on some crazy makeup.So yes, this mask is both functional, and FUNctional. For hiking, running, and scaring if it’s halloween time.
",0.8957841454,homeneeds,"I have been using this mask operating a portable sawmill on a near daily basis for a month now. The mask fits my xxl head okay, the nose clamp piece bends to fit well, and the ear loops help to keep it well placed. This mask is very light and of a nice mesh material that keeps things cooler than the neopreem one I also tried.If you are around dust, or particulates of any kind, for any duration, these mask are the best solution.I have ordered, and tried several different styles and sellers of these mask. The neopreem with ear loops, the mesh without the earloops, and this one, the mesh with earloops. They all fit okay, and filtered well. This rose to the top, slightly because it had both the cooler mesh (its very warm here in Louisville Ky now), and the earloops that help keep it in place.Ooh, and great support from Base camp. when changing a filter the cover for the check valve that holds the filter element in place broke a tab off and Base Camp responded immediately with a promise to replace. It took a few more days, as they said it would, and the replacement parts, and other generous guestures arrived.I may have pulled instead of twist the check valve cover, or just a fluke....they twist on and off.
",0.93189114355,homeneeds,"Moms are already magical but this makes the magic even more magic. I plugged the lamp in my daughter's room in with this. I'll just walk in at bed time and magically turn it off from the door with my mommy magic and she loves it. It's easy to use and I love that you can plug anything into it. The wand is great quality so I dont see an issue with it breaking anytime soon.
",0.91072404455,homeneeds,"This is such a neat idea having the remote be a wand. It’s certainly going to bring out the magic of Christmas for the kiddos! The wand has a good range and even sings a little tune when you press the buttons. Had to start decorating early just so we could use it :)
",0.89915031255,homeneeds,"It does the job but the wand sound to turn it on/0ff  is too loud and the connector that goes into power plug has an odd sized power cord. I needed to change my xmas tree position to make it work well since the xmas tree lights also has a small cord to plug in. But overall the kids are enjoying turn the xmas tree lights on/off using this ""magic wand"" .

",0.82967966856,homeneeds,"I was looking for a head lamp while doing work outside in the dark, since it gets darker earlier these days, and stumbled across this ""cheap"" headlamp. This headlamp, despite the price, is far from cheap. The light is incredibly bright and has multiple modes to choose from depending on your task in the dark. It’s cheap but works well
",0.556,homeneeds,"I bought this to use it for my job. It is perfect for hard to see dark spots also in dark rooms and even outside. I was surprised by the power of the light. It lights up very well. It has 8 settings you can adjust which is great so you definitely find the setting you need. The fact that is rechargeable is an added bonus. This is a very handy tool for me. It is high quality I highly recommend it.
",0.89146292256,homeneeds,"I need a new headlamp, after searching for some time and this brand of headlamp looks great, so I decided to buy this one. The old headlamp I used to repair the car has been used for too long, and the brightness is not enough, it can only be used for two hours after charging for more than ten hours. This new headlamp arrived very quickly, the quality looks good, and it's small and light. You can't feel any weight on your head and it won't fall off easily. So it's very comfortable to wear on your head and must be perfect for car repair. The power went out yesterday, just tried the headlamp first. It looks very bright, and there are many modes to choose brightness, I am very satisfied with this headlight!
",0.82971340456,homeneeds,"As far as value for money, brightness, and comfort it is five stars. I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and he absolutely loves it. He says its the best headlight he has had so far and that's saying something cause he is a fisherman, hunter, etc so he has used many flashlights/headlights! We haven't had to charge it yet and its going on day 4 so when its charge time I will edit and let you know how it is.
",0.94157862756,homeneeds,"I bought this product due since it was rechargeable. I have been very pleased with it, as it has exceeded my expectations.I have owned several headlamps of this type, but they all use relatively expensive (for the energy content) AAA batteries in order to be lightweight. Most put out relatively little light, and they consume batteries quickly.
",0.16977238756,homeneeds,"Great light options. Awsome bright light. Only thing I wish it had would be some kind of battery indicating percentage remaining.
",0.13280916256,homeneeds,"Very bright lights and works very well.  Different modes and red lights make it fun to use.  Its a little bulky but comfortable.  I am a little confused by how the back battery pack portion works and there were no instructions so that would be nice.  Other than that no complaints.
",0.95269930456,homeneeds,"I bought I similar one for my dad's bday and he loves it so much that I got him this one for the case. He took this one to work because of the case, he labeled it and is able to keep everything in one place. Also, this is extremely bright, for professional use only. Starring at it will leave you seeing stars for a while.
",0.80709004456,homeneeds,"This is a powerful head lamp. The light are super bright and it comes with multiple light functions. There are two control buttons for the main light and two smaller light that even turn red and blink. Totally a cool jogging light and good for safety jogging at night near the road. And it’s rechargeable, you can’t beat that.
",0.92884004156,homeneeds,"This headlamp has surpassed my expectations.It is extremely comfortable to use especially since the light swivels downwards.  The batteries at the back help with weight distribution during prolonged usage and it came with a nice carrying case.So far, extremely pleased with the product.
",0.82671821157,homeneeds," These lights are super bright! You get so many color choices to display! Makes fun for someone who enjoys changing colors often, or just settling on one color.They are easy to attach to anything you want to illuminate. They area a peel and stick attachment, so there won't be any damage to whatever you put them onto. There are so many uses for these lights since they are 16.4 ft. long.The remote control comes with a battery, so no need to run out and purchase one. It's easy to use and large enough so you don't have to feel like it's hard to hold or impossible to read the controls. Even a child can use the remote, it's super easy to use.I highly recommend this light set to one and all.  You can't go wrong with these!

Just what ineede one of the better sets out here in Amazon for sure
",0.95038038557,homeneeds," These lights work great. I purchased them for lighting under the trim of our entertainer center. I wanted something that could change color with the seasons and holiday decor. These lights have 20 different color settings, all variable brightness and 7 different programs of color changing. The main thing is to make sure the sensor for the remote is visible. When I initially set them up, there wasn’t good line of sight where I had tucked the box away. I actually used a bit of tape to make the sensor stay where I wanted it to.
",0.557,homeneeds,"These are really cool! Great for everyday use and holiday use!! Very very bright but has the option to dull it down some which is nice! Can strobe fast or slow! Will run thru them like a rainbow..there’s so many options! We have ours set on orange for Halloween!!

",0.95390993457,homeneeds," Ok, these are so cool! First off, different colors that can be changed via remote?! Yes please! Bright lights (bright enough you can turn off your ceiling light and still move around and see?) Why, thank you! Timer to automatically shut off?! Well, shut up! :) why wouldn't we love these lights?! They are light weight and I am currently waiting on those mini command hooks to string them up in my daughters room. However, we may consider just wraping them around a few thumbtacks around one of her door facings since they are so lightweight. She has also talked about hanging them around her window for some ambient nighttime window light. The possibilities are truly endless with these because they do not have to be near an outlet. I'm only wondering how quickly they will drain a battery. This won't matter too much because we utilize rechargeable batteries and always have a charged set on hand to swap out! I highly recommend these for any occasion and room!

",0.93409895959,homeneeds,"This light really does what it said. I didn’t expect much from it but it actually is quite beautiful. Has different settings options. You can set it to one pattern or mix them up and has continuous dynamic effect. Putting it together was easy, literally one screw. Comes with a stake for outside use as well. This will be awesome for a Christmas time. I read somewhere that projector lights calm babies so I decided to try it and my newborn was entertained and it did actually calm him down lol. Love this just for that.
",0.99182760759,homeneeds,"We've been using it since received. It works great as an alternative Christmas lighting because we are getting older now and going up and down a ladder to hang lights is no longer an easy job to do. We may add some lighted trees or the wreath just for some added impact. And I think two lights or more would be better than the one. Still, we're happy with the all metal quality and the remote control, which has worked for us, by the way.
",0.91761875259,homeneeds,"This light is quite bright. I've saw lots of these lights at local store but they are all kind of lame and hard to see the effects when in use with other Christmas lights.

It has many different color schemes - one is red and green so we are ready for Christmas in there 🤣 The coolest thing though, is how the lights can flash to the beat of music (or even your voice towards the little microphone). Dance parties are in her room from now on. [PS pictured is only 1 of the two strips - she hasn’t decided how she wants the other strip to go.]

",0.96698433262,homeneeds," Because the included Remote allows you to set a timer, you can leave this on at night in your chicken coop, and have it shut off when you want the chickens to go to sleep. It has a large solar panel, so it should have no issue charging in the rain or snow, as long as you keep snow and ice off of it. I love the lifetime warranty. It's easy to hang, and bright enough to work under. It seems to put out about half as much light as a 60W bulb. Great when no electricity is available, or when you want it to be mobile.  To use the remote you point it at the light bulb, not at the solar panel. The Solar panel has lots of great mounting options as well. It will work without the remote by coming on automatically at night.
",0.76549005562,homeneeds,"Nice little light for camping.  We used it as a tent light, wired the solar panel to a tree nearby and it seemed fully charged by dinner time.  It didn't go out or fade in the couple of hours we used it for reading.  The second night we got back to the site when it was dark and the auto-on had turned it on which made it easy to spot the tent.  I'm happy with it.

This light solved my problem.  Not only that is so easy to install but this light is so bright. It is not too big that I thought it was from the images I saw. There is a switch to turn it on/off on the solar panel and also comes with a remote which I dont really intend of using. Awesome product and I recommend it for those who who doesnt want to pay elecrtricians to run wires around your house that needs light.

It’s great for backyards, porches, decorations, camping, etc. or if you don’t want to pay electricity. The drawbacks are that you will need sun to charge this and it’s not overly bright at only 100 lumens or of a basic 65 watt bulb, in the white color. This is really made for convenience and even comes with a 16 foot cord which is great for hanging this up real high. A LED bulb is already installed so don’t need to worry about that or it getting wet since waterproof. The battery lasts a good amount of time throughout the night if you have a full days sun. One of the best features is that it comes with a remote that has a timer functionality. Overall I am impressed with this and would recommend.

",0.86203432162,homeneeds,"For a solar light, this was brighter than I had expected. The solar panel is big enough to store a lot of power, but it does need access to at least a few hours of direct sunlight per day. I do wish that there was more of a mounting structure included to help hang the light, overall I'm pretty satisfied that this could light up a porch or other small outdoor area very well at night. The remote and ability to adjust the brightness and set timers are also nice features. They don't include batteries though, so you'll have to provide two AAA's yourself.

This iPhone/iPad Charger is very cheap and has a durable dual USB portable travel wall charger USB adapter. The cable is 5 feet (2-Pack) so it is a long durable phone cable. We like it very much!
",0.77766734464,homeneeds,"This is compact travel dual USB plug, about the size of the original plug included on the iPhones. It is about a size of a quarter and I get two USB ports in a single adapter, which takes up less space on a power strip. Both output stronger current 5V 2.4A for newer devices and input with 100-240V AC making it universal for overseas travel.  No issues and practical for travel.
",0.564,homeneeds," I got this product for our overseas travel. So far, it’s been great charging 2 of our iPads (mini 4 and iPad 6) at the same time. I highly recommend this to anyone going overseas.
",0.92297470664,homeneeds," I needed a charger since my old charger wasn't working too well.. I ordered this charger and it came in 2 days.. I am very satisfied with the charger since it has two USB ports that I can use for iPhone and Android as well..  It comes with two data cables so I use the second one on my car.. The charger cords and adapter both are great.. Great value for money as well.. Highly recommended
",0.76092940664,homeneeds," Apple compatible and durable. Need charger long enough to charge my iPhone while I work in bed.  I’m always on the road so this help out big time.  Gave my son the other charger and he put a good beating on this cord.  Notice it still working and he always on the go with his after school sports.Overall nice value.  I want to keep it white and classy.  Looks like an Apple product.
",0.78905618264,homeneeds," I break phone chargers all the time by yanking on them because they’re usually too short. These are a great length. Pretty cheap for three chargers that are all longer. No more fighting over chargers at my house anymore.
",0.09521812264,homeneeds,"My wife and I are headed to Disney with the little one, and we wanted some extra charging cables and a brick just in case anything went south (Apple chargers are finicky). This was a great value for what we were looking for. It’s one less worry as we head to Disney. I haven’t used them much, but they’re effective and haven’t caused me any issues. For this price it’s a bargain, and with how much we’ll be spending at the parks, everything helps!
",0.78893315864,homeneeds," High quality cables for a great price! I love that the charging head has two usb a ports so this makes it extremely convenient. Now, I now longer have to fight with my sibling over who charges first
",0.87183684165,homeneeds,"I've been buying these ever since they first appeared here on Amazon. I use them on two ranches we have in Texas located in rural areas. Our properties sit fairly far away from the main highway and I use these for various applications. They are very bright, even on their lower power setting.#1. Application... I use 20 of these on a private runway I have for my airplane and they help me spot my runway at night when I am about a mile or more from my runway. The light head is adjustable and I slightly tip the light up so that from a higher altitude, they can be spotted by an aircraft. Once I have touched down, the beams do not aim horizontal and they don't interfere with my landing.#2. Application... Since we do not have neighbors nearby, I use four of these lights to deter burglars. (We have been the victim of theft twice in a span of 6 years.) I purchased two red tail light lenses at a junkyard off of an old GMC van and placed these red tail light lenses over the face of the two lights. I then mounted these to an aluminum stand I made that is about the same height and width of a typical set of tail lights on a pickup truck.These ""red tail lights"" are bright enough to be seen from the highway, and I place the ""tail lights"" near our house which is 1,300 feet away from the highway. At night, to the casual viewer (or crook) it looks like someone is in a vehicle with the engine on. We haven't had a theft since i made this ""optical illusion"" several years ago. I also place the other two lights on the opposite side of the house on my runway, aimed towards the highway 1,300 feet away, and it gives the impression that someone is in a vehicle, driving slowly or parked.These lights also work exceeding well to illuminate a pathway or a driveway, however they won't deliver the optimum duration of light if they are placed under trees or anything that prevents full sunlight from hitting the small solar panel. My runway lights typically stay illuminated 10 to 11 hours at night, and they get full exposure to sunlight each day.One thing I like about these lights is the fact that both the solar panel and the light head are able to articulate, so that you can easily aim the light at various angles and directions. The articulating solar panel allows you to adjust it for optimum angles during the winter, when the sun is lower in the southern hemisphere, or in the summer, when you need to ""aim"" the solar panel the other direction when the sun is further north.The only reason I do not give this product 5 stars is because of the 20 plus lights I own. some of them eventually loose an LED after a few months.... others have lost up to half of the LEDs after a few months, and some have simply ""died"" totally and no LEDS work at all. Yet that being said, I have a couple that have been in service for more than a year and still work fine.One tip I have is to occasionally clean the surface of the solar panel so that it can achieve full output. Dust and grime can eventually collect on the panel and reduce the amount of sunlight needed to recharge the internal batteries. The clear panel on the light itself might also need occasional cleaning, but I don't suspect most people with be getting their lights flighty from ""prop-wash"" off of a grass runway like I do.At the price, it isn't a big deal to replace the lights when they go bad, and you might have better luck than I do if you buy these and protect them form the rain.
",0.565,homeneeds,"Love these! I was looking for some decent priced solar lights because in tired of wasting money on my outdoor light,  no one remembers to turn it off! I found this 4 pack and love them! These lights can be staked into the ground or mounted. I wad hoping to mount them this next weekend,  but as you can see from the picture we just some snow.  The light is still shining even through a layer of snow.  I'm hoping to put 2 up on either side of my front door and 2 up at my back door.
",0.86252111265,homeneeds," These are some blindingly bright lights!!! We were looking for some lights to go in our front and backyard to light up trees, pathways, flag. Well they surpassed my expectations, I thought I might need a few for the yard and in reality I only need one maybe two. Has two settings, bright and blinding.  Love that it light ups the flag making it the showcase in the front yard. You can't beat solar living in the southwest!
",0.72681367465,homeneeds,"These are bright white and can be seen 1/4 mile from the road. They look amazing as we drive up the driveway. They can be adjusted down once for less brightness. Pretty dark where we live out in the country so these lights are huge. Because they work so well i will be ordering more. Easy to install. Simply used a mallet hammer to anchor these and you can then adjust the panel and the light to your likeness. Can't beat the no hassle installation.
",0.91916418165,homeneeds,"These lights are very good, almost great,But they are not waterproof.They work fine in good weather and even bad weather ( rain or snow). However, when you point the light straight up into a tree or the side of a building, the lights fill with water and stop working.  I have 12 of these lights and lost 3 of them that shine straight up into the trees. All others work perfectly, and long a th lies lights are on an angle.If you want waterproof, you need IP67.
",0.15041226165,homeneeds,"I love how these solar lights light upMy walkway.  Very bright.  Easy to install. Just stick the stake in ground.  There is a button on the back to turn them on.  Charged quickly by solar.
",0.93948042465,homeneeds,"These lights are great now that I have them working.  Didn't come with instructions... at first i thought it wasn't working.  Realized that there is a button under the solar panel that you need to push.  Now that it's on, the lights are bright for small spaces.  Wouldn't recommend for large area but for small spaces they do the job like walkways.
",0.0841585165,homeneeds,"These lights are simple to put together and make work.  I use them as uplights around my yard at night without having to waste electricity for the wired kind.  It adds a nice ambience to my yard.  I like that you just put it in the ground and they go to work and go on automatically at night and they are nice and bright.  I recommend this purchase :)
",0.87119364765,homeneeds,"These lights have exceeded my expectations.They’re very bright and can charge even on cloudy days.Good light dispersion and amazing lasting power.Nothing cheap, or shabby about these lights.They are really wide angle floodlights that provide excellent general illumination.Can't beat the no hassle installation,no more messing with wires and  having my electric bill go up...very cost effective.
",0.79015827265,homeneeds,"Lined the flower bed leading to my front porch.  Love how it turned out.  Not only does it look pretty but gives myself or guest extra lighting so safer walking up to porch.  I like that it has two settings so you can have them on longer if needed.  Appear to be good quality.  Puts off good lighting.  Happy with purchase
",0.95894968566,homeneeds,"Great addition to workshop tools. These are a very useful and easy to use tool the quality is much better than I expected these are heavy duty tough tools built to last a long time. I'm always running into odd angles when I work on the older house we live in and trying to get the angles just right on things like baseboard trim was always a pain with these it's a fast and I get a perfect match every time I'm finding out I use these a lot more than I thought I would. These contour tools make many jobs easier with better results because of the quality and usefulness I can recommend these to anyone doing handyman jobs around the house or even big jobs where accuracy counts.
",0.91441881766,homeneeds,"I am planning on tiling my bathroom again. This will help out with the orders as I was hoping. Why did they not have this when I did my tile years ago. This will make it so much easier! I am excited to get started and to see how perfect my edge cuts can be now. As you can see from my photo, the one corner shot is awesome. It will make it easy to cut and trace my corner piece of tile.

",0.16133502166,homeneeds,"Tool works as expected. The pieces move independently of one another to give you a perfect fit. It comes with 2 pencils and a sharpener. Draw on the item you want to cut to fit. Short and long for different areas. The black part has measurements on it. Works either right or left side. Good value for the money

",0.22864577268,homeneeds,"You don’t have to have a smart switch to control this bulb because its a smart bulb.  The bulb is controlled through the app.  Very easy to install, both the bulb and app.  The bulb just goes in like a regular one no additional steps.  The app is download and follow the instructions.  Great way to add ‘smart’ features to your home without having to higher an electrician if you are not inclined in that way..

",0.94919395468,homeneeds," First, the good...This is a smart bulb that is very easy to set up.  The Bluetooth works really well.  Best of all, you do NOT need a hub to operate this.  Hallelujah!  It produces a very pleasing amber colored light, which is easy on the eye.  It's also a really cool, vintage-style bulb.  I guess you would need/want a specialized fixture for this, so that you could actually see the coil inside.Now the problematic...This is pretty expensive, particularly when you look at competitors.  Without naming names (although it may or may not begin with ""W"" and rhyme with ""prize""), you can get smart bulbs for about $8 each that work well, don't need a hub, and can operate using a wide array of hues and brightnesses.  This one just doesn't put out much light in comparison.I like this bulb for the aesthetics of it.  It's glass.  It's retro.  It's pretty as an object.  But if you're looking for functionality.... Not  so much.

The only thing I would think could be better would be if the prongs folded up. I felt they would be susceptible to breaking, so I just carried the original box with me. Five stars as it was a great value and worked perfectly.

",0.91299414670,homeneeds,"Used in Mongolia and South Korea without a problem (10/16-10/26/19). Both the power outlets and the USB ports were used without fail. Two plugs and two USB ports was valuable. Easily fit in my carry-on. Would recommend if you need this type of adapter. Just remember it does NOT convert voltage or frequency.

Now instead of having to take pieces of furniture apart in order to get the contours I can simply use this and transfer the contour directly to the wood.  This is very well-made, has worked perfectly for me each time and I am very pleased with my purchase.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who does woodworking or other hobbies.
",0.76431989771,homeneeds,"I bought the 5 inch contour tool because of tight fitting areas.  We are going to replace the tile in our kitchen and tile a bathroom.  The tool works great.  Once you push against mounding corners you lift and it is locked in place.  I was worried it would be fragile and move around.  Not the case.  This should really help us with the remodels

The fins don't lose their positions from simple carrying the tool around.You may be limited buy one thing; the length of the fins. They can move about one inch. So you cannot do inside corners easily like crown molding. Outside corners would work fine.There is a ruler on the unit. You are supposed to use that for measuring from your reference point.

",0.96854448372,homeneeds," I bought my first iPhone about 2 months ago and it came with a $16 white apple charging cord which was only 3ft. It broke within 2 weeks which was ok because it was too short anyway. I replaced it with a 6ft white cable so I could use my phone while it charged, but after a couple weeks, the long white cable started to come apart where I pull it off of my phone 😒 and that’s when I discovered these nylon braided cords!!! These are so great! They are super duper strong even at the connection points. They are also super flexible and can withstand being bent up. I made a little video to demonstrate how ridiculously durable they are! My phone is currently charging with the cord I yanked on. Still works great!!!
",0.1421581872,homeneeds," I bought this item as my other cords for my devices always break on me. These cords are long (no matter how far the outlet is, the cord will reach), durable (the areas where cords tend to break are reenforced), and they are worth your money (other cord are of cheaper price also have worse quality). I would recommend if your cords tend to break often.
",0.15274709572,homeneeds,"Posted a pic for anyone using a case. The tip is not much larger than stock. I had no problems charging my iPhone in an otter box defender or iPad with these. Hopefully can find a 10ft version but when I look they seem to be slightly different and I don’t trust that. I noticed most cables had lots of unverified purchase reviews so it was hard but with the coupon offer I took the chance. Glad I did. The color is beautiful and awesome but I love blue lol. Hopefully lasts but definitely feels solid, seems to be stable in weak points. I put my stock charger away to use one, the other was for my kid who can destroy a cheap charger in a day. This gives length beyond 3-4ft that I do think that will help a bit. Thank you!
",0.84942239572,homeneeds,"For the price you cannot beat for a 2 pack 6 feet cord. They work like any other charger I have owned except that its sturdier. I like how its wrapped around with cloth so no matter how much you bend it nothing happens or damages the cord. So its very sturdy and I do not see this breaking like the regular rubber ones we get from iphone purchases. They also wrap up really nice and tangle free. Its 6 feet long which is fairly long so I can lay in bed and use my phone while charging it if needed. Overall great cord !

Should have invested in them long time back! Totally recommend!
",0.82190179872,homeneeds,"I can’t believe I got 2 of them for this price! The standard cord that came with my phone is not long enough. I also enjoy being able to charge at my bedside as well as while I use my phone in the living room. Charging is a breeze with this cord that is not only cloth covered but durable. It’s extra long length really helpful. I would buy this again and think it would also be a great gift for someone. It’s both practical and affordable.
",0.89338672272,homeneeds," This cable is very sturdy and long! I usually use a charging cable buddy to protects the junction of the charging cable but I think I don’t need to use it for this because the junction seem very firm and it will protect itself!!

",0.2267675472,homeneeds," After this purchase, I am a loyal purchaser of braided iPhone cables. The cables I have previously purchased for my iPhone have not lasted long. The cables usually begin to fray at the end, then it will only work when it is positioned in a certain direction and eventually stops working all together (if you have had an iPhone for a while, you know what I am talking about).I have not experienced any of those problems with these chargers. Besides the great price (2 extra long chargers for less than $10), the braided cables are able to stay intact even when tugged/pulled. The dark blue color is neat and makes it easy to pick out my charger when I am struggling with the mess of different device cables that I have next to my bed. The cable fits into my phone case with ease, which is another issue I have had in the past with other cables. My phone connects immediately when I plug the cable into my laptop and try to charge my phone. All in all, this is a great pair of iPhone cables.I have attached a video to show the length/color of the cables as well.

I purchased these for myself and have a very small wrist and I was worried that it may not fit well. I probably have a 8 inch circumference wrist and they fit very well on me. They are very soft in the inside so it does not irritate my skin. The magnets on the product are very strong.

That way I don't lose them on the ground. They are very comfortable and breathable; my wrists don't get sweaty when I wear them. They would also be perfect for anyone who uses tools that can be adhered magnetically to the wristbands, like carpenters, seamstresses, tailers, and electricians, just to name a few.  Highly recommended!
",0.94631373973,homeneeds,"My brother just started a new  job in construction and I wanted a small gift for him.I figured it would get a small laugh as he drops everything.But man was i surprised when I opened rhe bag it came in.It came with 2 in a small plastic bag designed to hold them.The quality is really good. It wasn't uncomfortable on my wrist at well. It didn't cut in anywhere, it was actually a good fit.I plan to order more for gifts now.
",0.928490473,homeneeds,"These come in handy when doing a home project or working on your vehicle. We put up a shed and the amount of screws we dropped was crazy. So when I saw these. I knew I needed to try them. These make it so you don't have to constantly go back and forth for different screw driver heads. And you can fit many screws and bolts on these, saving time. They fit on mine and my husbands wrists. With these wrist bands, you save time and frustration.
",0.84308898473,homeneeds,"Both of my sons work in construction. They are constantly loosing bits, nails and other small things. This works great! They can keep everything right at hands reach and they don't have to worry about loosing things. They fit great and are comfortable to wear all day long. These take a great beating and have lasted. They are great  quality and make amazing gifts for anyone! Even for those around the house for simple tasks.
",0.93054664173,homeneeds,"For size reference — I have tiny wrists & the size range comfortably fits me, but these could also fit a huge size wrist.  These securely hold nails, screws, etc — so you can efficiently hang pictures or do small tasks without having to climb up and down a ladder, or without needing another person to stand there and pass you stuff.  These definitely speed up projects.
",0.83649563873,homeneeds,"This is exactly what I wanted. These Magnetic Wrist Bands are what every person needs that takes anything apart or uses tools. Great for PC enthusiasts, PC technicians, Carpenters, Handy People and for anyone in the home doing projects. They are very lightweight and they feel very comfortable to me. You can't beat the price for the overall quality. The way they are made they should last an very long time.
",0.82216823174,homeneeds,"We only had our tv and cable boxes plugged in. I heard a noise like static to find this was catching on fire! I chose 1 stars for these only because I had to. I give it a fat zero and a fire hazard.
",0.574,homeneeds,"I have about 6 of the old version of this extension cord/surge protector.The old version had several unbeatable features:--swivel head so you could have the cord angled in the right direction--flat head so you could put furniture against the outlet--long cord so you could use it behind a sofa and still have enough cord to plug things in.The new version is more than twice the width.  It's absolutely huge.  Not really flat at all.The new version has NO swivel head.  It's locked in the down position.  :(The new version is so thick at the head that's it awkward to plug in and almost impossible to plug in without touching the prongs as you push it into the socket which is incredibly dangerous.I thought perhaps I ordered the wrong brand but my old ones all have GE stamped on them, so they just made significant changes to make the product inferior.  :(
",0.10846218574,homeneeds,"For the first two months, we thought this was fine; the protected light was on, everything stayed in place, life was fine. But then we had a storm and the power turned off and back on fairly quickly, but both our gaming system and sound-bar that had been plugged in are no longer functioning. So much for ""protected."" We wanted this to be so helpful, but it couldn't even last through one storm!
",0.87168985674,homeneeds," There is no locking mechanism on the product. “Twist to close” would be accurate but it no way do the covers lock into place. I would consider the covers then just a nuisance since it offers no protection and is so easily moved into undesired positions. Without an actual “twist to lock” feature this becomes an overpriced, annoying surge protector.
",0.77577137974,homeneeds,"We bought this because we need that flat, square plug that's pictured with the cord going off of the bottom right corner. Instead, we got a round one with a cord going straight down making it useless because of other cords using the same outlet being the way. Really irritating that what's pictured is not at all what we got but is what's advertised. That photo needs to be changed or they need to figure out who screwed up in the ordering process.
",0.09605848874,homeneeds,"I recently bought a bakers rack to go right outside my tiny kitchen, and by moving my microwave and Keurig to it, I freed up some much needed counter space.  But there's no outlet on that side of the narrow wall it's against, and while I could snake the rather short microwave cord back around to the kitchen outlet, my similarly short cord on the Keurig had nowhere to go.  So I figured another power strip was in order.  I didn't much care about surge protection, but this one caught my eye because the plug is flat, meaning I could plug it in behind the nearby loveseat and not risk crushing it against the wall.  The 10 foot cord was actually a bit more than I needed, and I knew that going in, but it means I was able to place it almost completely out of sight and have some cord length to spare.  It's pretty heavy duty and seems better made than the other power strips I've been using for years in different rooms.  Exactly what I needed, and at a great price.
",0.23966085974,homeneeds,"Works as described. Only issue is that it is somewhat difficult to get the plugs to go in all the way. It's not just one, but all of the outlets are this way on both of the units I purchased. Otherwise, exactly what I needed.
",0.13947072674,homeneeds,"I first measured out how long I needed the cord to be so that I wouldn't have extra cord laying around.  Then I use my wire-staple-gun to secure the cord to the wall neatly. And last I use double-sided-sticky-Velcro and I placed it on the back of the power adapter so that it would hold in place on the wall.Came out very clean!
",0.2327980774,homeneeds,"Nice surge protector, especially being so connected and dependent on technology..Blue light does not turn off, its too indicate that surge protector is working and is guaranteed that electronics are protected or something.. it does not bother me as surge protector is hiding behind some things but i could imagine, in a dark room it could be annoying to someone who's sensitive to light..  its not bright enough to be a night light but in a dark room it could be like a beacon or something?The point is, it does what its supposed to do.. Haven't had a spike in voltage or had to use the warranty but from what ive seen, used mainly as an extension for multiple outlets, its doing great!
",0.7607417774,homeneeds,"I have purchased 3 of these over the course of the last 3 months (10'). The home that we moved into did not offer much in the way of lighting. We needed a number of lamps to brighten the place up and several are linked to a specific outlet for the light switch. The longer cord was a necessity for us and got everything plugged in where it needed to be. Power strip has a small blue light near the switch to indicate it is on. We tucked it under our nightstand in the bedroom just in case to minimize any overnight glow. Outlet covers spin which can be convenient if needed. Overall I am happy with it and would not hesitate to pick up another if needed.
",0.575,homeneeds,"Much better quality over their older version. I bought their ""40-60"" TV led strip"" and it didnt quite fit my 55"" TV and it wasn't as bright as I wished it was. This one is brighter and of course longer and better suited for larger TVs. I have a 55 inch TV which is almost bezel-less and I placed my led strip about half an inch away from the edge all around the edge of my TV and I was still left with almost 4 feet that I had to cut off as excess. This would be perfect for a 60 incher too and perhaps a 65"". My only complaint would be the placement of the controller signal receiver, which is placed immediately next to the led strip. I wish it was separately connected so I could independently place it from the led strip. Other than that I have no complaints; hoping the life of this thing is substantial too as I can not say anything about it yet. Good product.Edit 03/18/2019: When I first applied this strip to the back of my TV it seemed to stick great. After a few weeks it started losing its adhesion and started to slowly peel off. I simply applied some strong clear tape to it and that fixed my problem. It's no big deal for me so I'm keeping the five stars it still works great but if the adhesive is a deal-breaker for you then this is not for you.
",0.08213460475,homeneeds," It is easily connected to a remote control and even can be set to move to the music. It puts off a great amount of light for its size. Now I have to get more because these are soo cool ! The sticky part that you use to put up - is ...well sticky!! It holds well. No worries about slipping or falling.
",0.86539733475,homeneeds," Suoer awesome lights! Easily attach to walls to add a bit of flare to any room! My son instantly claimed them for his ""gaming corner"". Very bright colors with different options to fade or flash. Remote control makes it easy to switch them on or off or change colors.
",0.96162998775,homeneeds," These Pangton Villa LED lights are tiny and mounted on a flexible strip that comes with small brackets for installing around a window or other area. At the end, you plug the strip into the power cord which plugs into a standard outlet. As you can see in the video, you can change the color of the lights to various shades red, green, blue or white in a given palette with a mini remote. There are effects you can apply like flash, strobe, fade, or smooth. These lights will look really cool around the doorframe in my grandson’s room!
",0.575,homeneeds,"hey do not buy this product it came damaged and didnt work!
",0.04772323475,homeneeds,"I purchased these lights to go under my sons’ bed. The length was just perfect to wrap around the headboard, one side, and the footboard of his full-size Ikea bed. The one side of the bed does lean up against the wall, so I wasn’t worried about covering that side with the lights. It was extremely easy to stick underneath the bed. We plugged it into an Alexa outlet so my son can easily ask her to turn on the lights at night. The remote is easy to use. My son loves how he can change the colors the footboard goes one color, headboard another, etc. The colors are sharp and vibrant. My son loves this add to his room.
",0.95683920475,homeneeds," Got the lights today, super easy to set up!! Love all the colors. Super bright!
",0.99373674475,homeneeds,"I hung these up on the ceiling in my classroom. They were easy to apply by myself and are still up. I love the color. And so thankful they came with a remote. I can change them and it completely changes my classroom. Love them
",0.92334306275,homeneeds,"I decided I needed some more led lights in the house. I put these around my tv in the room. There is an awesome glow in the room, from just the little bit of lights around the tv. Since I had more left over, I ran it along the back of the dresser the tv sits on. I like how I can control the lights with the remote, to change the mood or just have them dimmer. These are not waterproof. So perfect for electronics and places no liquid goes. It is 5 meters long. Comes with led light strip, remote and wall plug in.
",0.21618181575,homeneeds," this is a nice set of multi-function LED lights I like all the different colors it has especially the Blues.  and it's really long as you can see in the video my granddaughter was extremely happy now she wants more for her room they are made well this trip is really thick and strong it was easy to apply to the wall with the tape adhesive it has.
",0.87863594376,homeneeds,"My son thought I was planning to be winter solder for Halloween. Ha ha. Truth is. I have been gearing up to do a basement renovation. There will be lots of drywall dust. This will keep lungs safe. Comes with multiple filters too.
",0.86603093176,homeneeds,"Very comfortable and easy to use/wear.  I had no issues fitting this on both myself and my husband.  The filters are easy to replace.  The earplugs were a nice bonus!
",0.97957360776,homeneeds,"easy enough to put on, seems to fit well. might be a little tight over the ears if left on for long periods of time, but this may be necessary for a good seal.  Appreciate the extra filters. Wish the reusable zip lock bag was a little roomier.Will look great on Oct. 31 with a chain saw.
",0.93340158576,homeneeds,"This is a very comfortable filter mask with N99 filtration level.  I got it to prevent the breathing in of tie dye powders for ice dyeing.  These are way more comfortable than the disposable paper ones.  This set comes with a bunch of replacement filters which is nice.
",0.95426702576,homeneeds,"I do a bit of woodwork in my free time in the garage. I have a really bad pollen and dust allergy and have tried a few masks. I think the activated carbon filter here really does the trick! I finished my two hours last night and did not notice a thing. Usually, my eyes get watery and itchy. The mask is really comfortable to wear as well.
",0.14969539676,homeneeds,"This is really helpful when you don’t want to talk with people and just be yourself. The earplugs and thick mask do a great job of isolating you from whoever while being able to be at the workplace. This worked a lot better than regular masks because it contoured my face well. Great in the workplace as well so the boss won’t interrupt you while getting most of my PPE essentials down. I expect this to work great during snow-skiing since its pretty darn good at retaining heat.
",0.78816372276,homeneeds,"Needed something better for when I use the paint sprayer the paper masks at the home improvement store were too thin. The heavy duty masks sold locally were too expensive, so I hope this mask does what I want. Decent quality with extra filters so for the price its ok. even if it doesn’t work as I want I can use it when I mow the lawn.
",0.07813000776,homeneeds,"It was a gift for my partner when he cleans the cat litter. I have asthma and my lungs can't handle the dust. I felt awful that he suffers in my place, so I looked for a solution. The price was right and he says that it works great! He no longer breaths in the dust that flies up and he told me that is was comfortable. So far, so good.
",0.15336480776,homeneeds,"The mask is very easy to breathe in and it's nice and snug on my face. It also has a nose clip to adjust the tightness as it is flexible. It comes with two extra filters that are easy to replace. To replace a filter you simply rotate the plastic clip on the outside pull it off change the filter and put the clip back on. I use this to cut the grass with and it prevents me from sneezing all day! Highly recommended for those allergy sufferers.
",0.89252990576,homeneeds,"This thing is decent.  It's comfortable for sure, the material is very soft and pretty comfortable.  I'm not a germ-a-phobe, I picked this up with the intent to use it my garage, where I do some occasional woodworking as a hobby.  I'm not really sure the filter really makes a difference for saw dust, but this works and stays better than wrapping an old shirt or towel around my head and face to keep from breathing the dust in.  This is NOT a respirator for things like paint fumes, etc but does what I need it to do.  I can't imagine ever going through the process of ordering and replacing the filter, given the the price of the whole mask.
",0.84233450977,homeneeds,"This is a handy little unit.  Simple and effective.For some reason, the builder of my house thought that just one outlet was needed in the garage which drove me nuts.  I picked up this 6 outlet adapter and it's made plugging in multiple devices in my garage much easier.There are two, 3-prong plugs on the back of this (see my attached picture).  I confirmed that the top plug powers only the top 3 outlets and the bottom plug powers only the bottom three outlets.It's super simple to install.  If you are planning to just use this temporarily, you can just plug it into your wall outlet as-is without having to remove your outlet cover plate.  If you want a more ""permanent"" solution, remove the wall outlet cover plate (the center screw in the middle), plug this unit into the wall, and attach it using the longer screw that comes with this unit.  Don't over tighten this screw, you just want it snug enough so that the adapter doesn't unplug from the wall.This is not a surge protector.  It's a simple, basic, grounded adapter (hence the 3-prong plugs on the back) that turns a 2 plug wall outlet into 6 plugs.  It's rated at 15 amps (which is more than likely what your wall outlet is rated at) so if you overload the circuit breaker for the outlet you have this plugged in to, it will trip the breaker.It doesn't have lights, or a bell, or buttons to push.  It's not Bluetooth compatible.  You cannot control it with your phone, voice, or hand gestures.  It is un-hackable--however plugging your computer into this does not make your computer un-hackable.  It is a deterrent for saber-tooth tigers, because since I've installed mine, I haven't seen a single tiger.It is made in China.  It does work.  It works well.####UPDATE 10/25/2016####It's still working great and still no sign of tigers.
",0.577,homeneeds,"This is an okay choice if one doesn’t need surge protection. Having said that  there are a few issues buyers should be aware of:1) Given the size of many power adapters today the average user may find that they are not able to use more than four receptacles at a time, which has been the case for me.  So for most purchasers this might really only be a four outlet adapter, doubling existing capacity on a traditional outlet, not tripling it.  See photo I’ve included for example of actual utility.2) Because of how close the outlets on this are to one another one can actually insert a plug into separate receptacles with the negative and positive inputs for the plug being in the wrong holes in two different receptacles. I’ve mistakenly inserted plugs this way on numerous occasions. I’m not sure what kind of danger might be associated with having plugs inserted this way but I can’t imagine it would be safe, and I’m not planning on testing it out. It seems a very curious, and potentially serious design flaw.  See you second photo I’ve included for an example.3) The item was a decent enough value for me that I decided to order more of them, but the second set I ordered came in an odd color. I have included a third photo to demonstrate the color comparison.  One can see that while the first was a basic white the second two had a bluish-green tinge to them, which made them look very much out of place where I had intended to use them.
",0.19248148877,homeneeds,"This is the only one of its kind that I could find. What's so unique? Is the fact that each bank of 3 outlets is connected to its own plug in the back.For most of us that is not important but if you have a double cabled wall outlet like the outlets you may have in your bedroom for the night stands that are controlled by the wall switch, you will care a lot. You may say that you can leave the lamp on the switch controlled half and use a 3 ports extender for the other one. But that means when you plug something from the extender you will need two hands so you do not unplug it with everything else. With this one you cannot as it is secured to the wall outlet by the central screw.
",0.577,homeneeds,"I purchased as I replaced an old clock radio in my bathroom with a new radio/CD stereo and felt I should use surge protector.  I had a 6-tap outlet because my bathroom only had 2 outlets which was not enough since I also use hot rollers and a curling iron.  I also did not want any lights on it (green and/or red) and leaves a clean look in my bathroom.  Exactly what I wanted and needed.
",0.2028852477,homeneeds,"I love these outlets.  Every time you move into an apartment community you just never know where the plugs are going to be.  Apartment I live in right now happens to be the one with the least amount of cords I have ever seen!  I have some walls in my bedroom that just don't even have a plug!  So I'm constantly crowding around the available plugs.  These things typically last  a very long time so when she purchased them they will always be useful no matter where you are. These are also great for the plugs you have with larger bases where you might only get two plugs out of the bottom Portion. ( as you see in my review photo) I have since ordered another one  from this ad.  And I actually have a total of four of these in my apartment.  Really helps with the boyfriend comes over and brings his charger  and the needs to move his charger into the living room so now I have space for other people to come over to plug their stuff in.
",0.73234343577,homeneeds,"Uhm.... Not sure how this could get less than 5 stars. It does fine providing power to multiple devices and mounting over existing wall plate just fine.For my purpose I needed the outlets to be in this type of layout but if you're going to be plugging cords that have adapters on the end then I would recommend getting the other versions that can swing out the 3 outlets on either side otherwise you're most likely to lose clearance for another outlet
",0.24681943777,homeneeds,"Two nice features here: (1) this uses -2- plugs in the back (see below) and (2) has a robust center screw for securely grabbing the outlet.Having 2 rear plugs, this is really 2 sets of 3 outlets.  In my bedroom, where the wall switch controls only 1 of the 2 outlets in the nearby wall dual-outlet, this provides 3 outlets that are turned on by the light-switch, and 3 outlets that are always ""on"".  The former 3, when the switch is ""on"", power the electric blanket and the bedside light (I use it's own switch when going to sleep and upon arising).  The latter 3 always power the clock and the cellular charger.  Alternative 6-outlet adapters often have a single rear plug with a dummy (plastic) second plug: this precludes their use in my bedroom situation.The robust center screw means you don't have to worry about pulling this out of the wall each time you pull on a power cord - a problem I experienced with a previous unit.You require clearance around this as it is taller and wider that a standard outlet-surround: door or floor moulding might (rarely) pose a problem.  Likewise, this width would be incompatible with ""ganged"" outlets having multiple outlet pairs as in some work environments..As this uses the standard center-screw of the outlet, the usual outlet cover plate is discarded.The plastic on this isn't overly durable: it seems adequate but a kick night shatter it, if you're into kicking outlets!
",0.577,homeneeds,"This a single use surge protector. No reset. If it trips it is trash.Must have a hair trigger on the sensor. No other devices on the circuit tripped. There was a minimal load on this device, 8-port switch and an LCD monitor.  The outlet it was plugged into works fine. Oh well.
",0.73083722677,homeneeds,"Presently surprised.  I was weary because of other poor reviews.  Also, it could burn out in a few months and be useless.  But until that days comes I'm really happy with it.  It fits (standard) outlets really well and hangs on great.  Unlike some of these that only use one outlet and simply blocks the other outlet in the duplex, this one has two sets of metal stabbers.  I didn't take it apart to find out if each stabber serves three outlets but I don't care.  I was just excited that it holds the wall well.  I have had heating bulbs and a heating pad plugged in and no sighs of overloading.  Thougu obviously you can't draw more amps than your circuit breaker and duplex will allow, usually 15 amp.Screw in the center lines up right and if you remove the outlet cover you can screw this into an old ""oval"" duplex but not the newer ""decora"" rectangular outlets.I will caution in case this is what you're looking for.  This will NOT fit a GCFI outlet because the duplexes are just ever so slightly further apart.  If you need that I'd suggest looking for a single-stabber version.
",0.22508573577,homeneeds,"Bought this to increase capacity of outlets in my bathroom. It has accomplished that although the plug holes are too close to use all of them if any of the plugs are not regular size plugs. Many hair appliances (blow dryers, etc) have larger plug ins. I'm able to plug in four of my items but I can't keep everything plugged in simaltaeously as I'd like. The plug ins are very tight - good in that they stay intact and don't come unplugged, bad because it takes two hands to plug and unplug.

",0.580,homeneeds," Just purchased this product and thought i should give a review for it. First this product shipped perfectly on time! The lights themselves lit up perfectly. Each individual LED is about 2 inch’s apart. More specific details are probably giving in the description but, i think these lights are great if you dont want them to glow up your entire room. If you want a calm smooth led strip light this is perfect for you. I personally feel they are great for a tiny room. One drawback is the music lighting dosnt work on any music from your music app like spotify. the app may needs some corrections for the music mode but other than that the app lights up the LED’s quickly with no delay. Overall i feel This class is great, the only reason why i gave it a 4 star is because of the music mode, other than that it is a great purchase. Hope this helped.
",0.95284032880,homeneeds," My kids love these light strips. I first got a set for my husbands quad, then my son wanted some for his room. My daughter soon wanted some for her room. It’s a family affair, I should buy stock. 🤣Super easy to put up. Lots of different colors and modes. Can be set to music. They are really a lot of fun.
",0.9435937480,homeneeds," Awesome product. Was super easy to set up, took about 3 minutes to set up (and I’m not super tech savvy) The colors are bright and vibrant. They will blink to your voice or the beat of the music or just any setting that you want. The app allows you to chose any specific color you want also! They come on reels so they don’t tangle. I would recommend these to anyone, I cannot wait to hang them up at the campsite next week!
",0.95699197180,homeneeds," The lights are decorated with a festive atmosphere. The operation is simple. The lights are rich in color. The quality is very good.

",0.98227202980,homeneeds," I was surprised by the unboxing experience with these. I’m used to cheap brown packaging with these lights but these were packed very well and had decent instructions in the box, that seem to actually be written by an English speaker. Go figure. The LEDs do not seem to be individually addressable, but they are ‘smart,’ so you can expect some good integration with music. The white temperature is a little blue, which is a common flaw with these strips. The strips are bright and colorful and will look good hanging up in your man cave, dorm, or bedroom.
",0.91219830580,homeneeds," Beautiful lights. These should be attached to something...they look unfinished on their own. They are meant for providing a glow for under cabinets, for example. I bought them for use in my halloween party decorations and they are very very useful due to their thin and unobstructive nature. I can easily control their colors and they link to each other easily to be controlled by one remote. Wish I had found these years ago!
",0.79718089181,homeneeds,"For the price, this is a wonderful addition to your holiday decoration. It could even be used independently if you’re not much in the decorating mood. There are multiple slides that can be used for holidays and seasons and the images are so nice. Everyone complemented my house this Halloween and so I decided to get another one to gift to my parents. They’re getting older and don’t feel like decorating much anymore. They were so happy to have received this as a gift. I’m going to keep it in the ground year round and change out the slide accordingly. Best thing is: if it gets damaged or goes missing, it is super cheap and you can get another one!

I got a ton on cards with different designs which means I can use this for more than just Christmas and Halloween. It also has a great remote that is easy to use.
",0.96761864481,homeneeds,"This projector had been awesome. We used the Halloween slides for our Halloween decorations and they looked great. I love that there's a remote so you can control the powered and settings from the inside. I used the timer feature most so I could have the projector turn off at night while I slept saving on electricity. I can't wait to use the Christmas theme. There's multiple slides for Christmas (as well as other holidays)  so I'll be able to change it up throughout the season.
",0.89441758481,homeneeds,"Bought this projector right in time for Halloween. It comes with so many different holiday/characters that it will be used all year long. It has a yard stake that can be used to hold it up and point towards the wall, it also has a flat bottom mount to sit on a flat surface. It tilts easily and has a good rotation. The best part is the remote so I can switch things up from inside my warm house.
",0.87554562181,homeneeds,"These lights are sooo fun!! We are extremely happy with our purchase. It comes with a ton of different slides for different Holidays. You can control the speed of the movement and if you want a flicker. It gives you the option to use a stake for the ground or even a wall mounting plate. Would recommend to anyone!
",0.94555491281,homeneeds,"My kids are obsessed.  We took it out to test it and the kid loved chasing the pictures on our floor and it seems it might not even make it outside! I'm happy with the quality and like that there are so many slide options.  Simple to set up as well.
",0.85484117381,homeneeds,"This took our yard decorations to the next level. There are so many slides so I can use this for almost any holiday. You will probably need an extension cord to get the right placement on your house, otherwise it is an odd angle.
",0.85917842481,homeneeds,"This holiday projector is really nice. If you are like me getting so tired of hanging up all your decorations outside this is the thing for you. It was great for Halloween but will be good for so much more. It comes with slide cartridges for lots of holidays Christmas, Easter, birthdays, ect. This is truly one versitile projector. This is one that will be getting a lot of use. Excellent buy at a great price.
",0.97212624581,homeneeds,"My kids love these lights. We were able to use them for Halloween and now have a Thanksgiving theme in them. There are several Christmas options, a New Years and even a Valentine's Day one. I like that it comes with a stand that it can be used inside but also a stake to be put outside. Very simple to operate as well.
",0.82267290481,homeneeds,"I am so impressed with these little projectors ! They are great quality - very solid and durable materials. They have several different slides you can choose from. They have a timer so you don’t have to worry about turning them on or off. They are great for inside or outside. Very festive and fun!
",0.97732657282,homeneeds,"I was looking for a WiFi outlet to control some heavier duty devices.  This smart plug handles 16 amps and 2000 watts. More than the typical smart plug and for the same price!I use the Smart Life app on my phone and the Smart Life skill on my Amazon Echo (Alexa).Set up.Setting this up is as simple as plugging the outlet in for the first time and watching for the light to blink.  Then I open the Smart Life app on my iPhone and hit “+” to add a device. Next, I select the device that eventually pops up and wait... it takes another 15 secs or so and the device is added.  I change the name to something easy to remember (like “light”) and it is done.Voice usage:To voice activate it using Alexa (assuming you have the Smart Life skill enabled in Alexa) I simply say “Alexa turn on light” and “Alexa turn off light”.  If you have multiple Amazon echos, the commands will work on all the Echos once it works on one.  The nice thing is you can use the Smart Life app to control your devices even when not home (for example, to turn on lights to make it look like you are home).Usage Tip:A pro tip is to use the scenarios to do a few things at once.  To do this you simply click on the Smart icon at the bottom of the screen and under scenarios, hit “+” to create one, name it something simple like “bedtime”.  Then add in devices and the action you want.  Like, when going to bed, turn on lights where you want them, turn off all other lights you or devices (fans?).. I added a timer so some lights are on to light the way to my bedroom, and turn them off after a couple minutes. When done, make sure you click “save”. Then to execute the scenario say “Alexa, run bedtime”.Tech that makes life simpler.
",0.582,homeneeds," I use it with my google home mini and it works best. I don’t have to go the switch to turn on or turn off the lights. Works like a charm.The device itself is pretty sleek. It takes normal space like any other plug and doesn’t obstruct the other plug below. The connection so far has been on point. After more than a week of usage, it has not failed on me yet.The setup is pretty straight forward as long as you follow the manual. I have a smart bulb connect to the smart life plus app, for me, connecting it to my google home was easy Peasy.
",0.91761177882,homeneeds," I buy this device for turn off my 3D printer after it finish printing. I can turn it of when I’m not at home. Work very well, save electrical bill.
",0.21369987782,homeneeds,"I love these plug controllers. I use it with Alexa. You have to set up the smart life app on your phone first and make sure everything works before you can set it up with Alexa.  Make sure you select 'Multiple Socket' and not 'Electrical Outlet' when setting it up on the Smart Life app. If you don't, I think it only turns on and off both plugs at the same time instead of individually. After that all the plugs showed up in the Alexa app. If you make any changes to the plug settings on Smart Life after Alexa has been set up, I suggest you delete the plugs on the Alexa app and tell Alexa to 'scan for new devices' to find the updated plugs settings.I have two cabinets in my living room with built in lights. It is a pain to reach behind the cabinets to turn the lights on and off with the switch built into the electrical cord. After I plugged both cabinets into one of the outlets, it is now easy to turn the lights on or off with Alexa, the Alexa app or the Smart Life app.  I will be buying another set for some more lights in another room. If your internet goes out you can turn the plugs on and off by pressing the button on the front of the plug.Please note that this only turns the plugs on and off. It is not a dimmer plug.
",0.582,homeneeds," I had an eye plug that was controlled by remote and have been using it since an year. I saw smart plug first at my friend’s place and was amazed by the convenience of not having to hunt for remote everytime.I ordered this one about a month ago. It comes with a guide on directions to install. It takes exactly two minutes to install and bamm you are done!It uses wifi and can be operated by phone. I do not have alexa or google home so I am not sure how effectively the product performs with then.
",0.8150343382,homeneeds,"Our daughter had these at her house for some lights and I ordered them based on how well they worked for her.  The plugs are very well made, quick to setup and integrate easily with Alexa.  We've had some fun with the ability to name the devices in the app.  Telling Alexa to Turn on Thing one and Thing two is rather amusing :)I will be ordering more!!
",0.97522211182,homeneeds,"Easy to set up. Worked within 5 min of taking them out of the package. I use Bluetooth on them and can turn off the lights or tv without getting out of bed
",0.92290151182,homeneeds,"I can’t believe I waited so long to purchase a smart plug!! I was so excited, to receive these after being a friends house and learning about this stuff! The plugs came well packaged, I love how it doesn’t take up a whole outlet. I downloaded the Smart life app and connected it to my Alexa, I love being able to have the ability to tell it to turn on and off! Both my kids want them for their rooms so they can tell it to turn on and off their nightlights! I am  definitely going to order more of these!
",0.87904334182,homeneeds,"I ordered smart plugs from 2 different manufacturers and I like this one best. Not only was this less expensive but it performed just as well. Pairing was a breeze and the app provides good information and ease of use. Also this plug is able to handle a higher amperage than the others I've researched, which helped convince me to buy. Alexa hasn't had a problem connecting not once. I'm happy with the product and satisfied with my purchase; I will reorder more to expand my smart network.
",0.92210620682,homeneeds,"You must install the Tuya Smart Life app to use the Smart Plug. The app Privacy Notice (yes I read those things) talks about the collection of user and mobile device data, sharing with 3rd parties, etc. I just want to turn the outlet on and off remotely. I don't want or need another company mining my data. I returned the Smart Plug.
",0.583,homeneeds,"I did all the calculations for how much epoxy I would need to sink all my parts in it, and in the end, there ended up being about 11 cubic inches worth of wasted material from the mixing cups. Just be aware, order more! All in all, this is a good product!
",0.77386647583,homeneeds," OK first thing this is my first time really trying to pour epoxy. That being said you might hear some newbie terms or something like that so bear with me! I really liked they give you everything you need to get started other than creativity. So I'm making a small lamp with driftwood from a special place my wife and I go to. What I initially didn't like was that when mixed it bubbles were everywhere! But they literally pop themselves. So the picture I included is the first time coating the wood so when I pour it doesn't bubble from air in the wood. I haven't used the little spatula thing but it does level itself so I'm not sure I'll need it. If you are new to epoxy I'd recommend you try this out. It's definitely easy to use and they give you a number to text along with an email address for troubleshooting. I really appreciate that as I had several questions. I mixed a little acrylic paint in for some tint and right now I'm ridiculously happy with it. Buy this!
",0.88129210583,homeneeds,"I purchased this epoxy resin because of its low cost and my wife and daughter enjoy casting in silicone molds. It mixes with no odor and is easy to clean up afterward. This resin brings out more detail of the molds then the more expensive brand at the craft store. I have molded with it clear and got glass like results and I have colored it with acrylic paints also and it has set and colored perfectly. My daughter has said this is now her favorite resin for casting.
",0.82586073983,homeneeds,"I have been dying to attempt to make some of the epoxy tumblers that are all the rage these days, but I didn't know where to start.  I am, definitely, NOT an expert at making anything with epoxy at this point, but this is a great set that includes everything you need, and the bottles of epoxy and hardener are huge!  Inside the box, you get 36 oz. bottles of each of those along with measuring cups, a spatula, and wooden stirring sticks.  From what I have seen, too, the price point for this complete set is lower than the epoxy you can pick up at your local craft store.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again, if I get better at crafting with epoxy😁
",0.87716066883,homeneeds,"This is good resin for people who want to start making with resin. It's easy to pour, measure and mix. When it's finished drying, it's easy to sand, it's not cloudy and it's perfectly clear. My only problem with it is that it takes 72 hours to dry, but I've used epoxy resins that take only 24 hours. So, I'd recommend it if you're fine with waiting for it to dry, and you want a good quality clear resin.
",0.8368104183,homeneeds,"I received this product either free or discounted with the understanding that I will leave honest feedback after trying it.My mother collects paper weights so I wanted to get this product and make her a paperweight with shells and sea glass we have found together through the years. It turned out great. The epoxy is good quality, self levels like it should, and was workable for about 40 minutes after mixing. Comes with cups to measure and mix, wooden sticks, and a plastic spatula to smooth it out. Definitely will use again.
",0.91266506983,homeneeds,"I bought this resin because I've been wanting to make craft jewelry for Christmas gifts. I was shocked by how large the containers of resin and hardener actually are. I don't think I'll ever run out! It also comes with measuring cups, wooden sticks, and a spatula. It works as promised and it's so versatile! I knew what I was getting but I just didn't expect everything contained within to be of such high quality. This was a fantastic purchase!
",0.76614165383,homeneeds,"I am more than excited about using this awesome kit! I have been wanting to preserve my kids finger and foot prints and some other items around the house and this is so perfect. I Am unexperienced with resin art I think it’s called but I am so wanting their precious prints to last forever and this kit is perfect because not only does it have instruction, but they are easy to follow. The ingredients and measuring cups and stir sticks, this kit is perfect for all types of experiences without any intimidation.  Very good price compared to what I have seen in the stores and other places online.
",0.93347752183,homeneeds,"Super excied over this kit I purchased. My son has been wanting to preserve his 4 leaf clovers and a some other items and this is perfect.

",0.93087369284,homeneeds,"Seems to do the job it's intended for as good as you'd expect. One thing I was worried about was if the form would slide out of position easily as soon as you moved it around, making it kind of useless. This isn't the case,they sort of make it tensioned well enough to where it doesn't move out of position after you make it a form, so it does it's intended job well .
",0.17434823584,homeneeds,"These contour guides are excellent for what I need to set up our new house. There are lots a little nooks and crannies that I need to gauge in order to cut tile floor and many other surfaces. It would be in addition to my toolbox as a new homeowner, or rather a DIY guy. The price point was on Mark, and I have seen them for more expensive, but not as durable or high-quality.
",0.8079198684,homeneeds," By far one of the coolest and most useful tools I have ever purchased. It is ready to go right out of the box. I gave it to my handyman (who is also my husband) and he was very impressed with it. He used it to for the edge of a tile job he was doing. He didn't have to guess and cut and it is so easy to use One push and the pattern captured to sto transfer to the material you were cutting. It seems to be made of high quality plastic. The only thing my husband wishes is that there were some sort of box or protective case to go with it. He is not the kindest to his tools and many times its ""throw it into the back of the truck"" . You don't know how many tools have been lost with this valuable technique. This tool is such a winner he is searching for a case to put it in. What are you waiting for? You need one!!!!!!!!
",0.76944351284,homeneeds,"The size of the contour gauge is longer and wider than I thought, and it can replicate into 2.3 inches. the first time, I used it in laying carpets, measuring the outline of the corner of the door, it is really save me a lot of time.Nice helper!
",0.72449713984,homeneeds,"I decided to try these I do a lot of metal work and at times you have to customize stuff to work around things already in place so this looks like a great tool to use. One of my co workers swears by it so here I am lol.  Seems well built and the tape is a extra.
",0.83059996484,homeneeds,"We are planning to update our flooring and I keep seeing videos for this product...figured it was something we could use to get the flooring cuts just right. Haven't used it yet but I read many reviews and this brand came out on top. Also, glad that 2 sizes are included...the bonus tape measure is really nice. Very pleased with this order and am sure it will come in handy when we get ready to do the flooring.
",0.96674442384,homeneeds,"I have been seeing commercials and ads about this product and I've been wanting to get one so when I saw this set for 2 (small and large) I couldn't pass it up.  It's a great value and you get a small tape measure with it.  I'm using it around a pedestal sink in my bathroom so the tile fits nicely surrounding it.  So glad I got this, you won't be sorry.
",0.22285857884,homeneeds,"My husband was building a deck recently and cutting openings for trees to grow THROUGH the deck.  It is so difficult to cut a pretty hole that's just the right shape. Then I ran across these.  I just knew they were the right tool and I was right. These are tight enough not to slide every time to you move them but loose enough to make exact copies of the edge you need to match. And the 'pins' are tiny enough for very finite work.  Plus, they are kind of fun to 'play' with for the kids.  They hold up really well.  Great product.
",0.8450676284,homeneeds,"This is an awesome gauge to have to duplicate intricate shapes and angels, too bad it didn’t come with a case.  But I Highly recommend this gauge.
",0.84181988284,homeneeds,"These contour gauges are not only useful for the normal carpentry purposes, but I plan on using them for artistic purposes in accurately repeating patterns over and over from an original.  They work really well for this.
",0.92413914285,homeneeds," These are awesome but expect a yellow warm glow rather than a clean, crisp, light.
",0.96379125185,homeneeds,"These are simply beautiful even in the day when candles aren't turned on, and even more beautiful at night when flame is flickering they look so real.
",0.86885982885,homeneeds,"Fantastic High Quality candles.. purchased these for my Elderly Mother... easy to use and are very decorative... Used all Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and are still on the original batteries...batteries not included!
",0.9076913685,homeneeds,"Because the outer cylinder is clear plastic rather than wax, these have the potential to be more durable.  Would be even better if the plastic was slightly frosted to disguise the false flame a little at close range.
",0.90789222785,homeneeds,"I bought these electric candles for the comfort of our leasing.  These candles shine brightly, batteries are enough for a long time use.  We use rechargeable batteries - it is profitable.  There is a remote control with settings in the kit - a huge plus is that there is a timer and the choice of glow is just like a light or like a candle.  Interesting candles.  These lights are not plastic - this is glass !!!!!

They are relaxing and even a bit romantic looking. They look like actual flames, but are safe enough to even allow toddlers to touchThe remote has several different features. You have the option of doing different levels of brightness and so forth. It even has a timer that will turn itself off after a while so in case you forget it doesn’t needlessly waste your batteries.
",0.76135289785,homeneeds,"Too cool! Looks super realistic! I read the reviews and kind of was on the fence but went ahead and ordered two. So glad I did! great investment. I was looking for an alternative to actual candles to light up my new apartment and these flameless ones sufficed! looks so real my sister was surprised and didn't believe they were artificial lol. The cool thing about them being battery operated is that you don't have to have all the candles in one place. They come as a set of 3 and as you can see in the picture I have two on my coffee table and the other one in the guest bathroom. OMG really like these candles! Anyhoo I am about to place another order after I submit this review. I would like to put some in the master bedroom and bathroom! Hmm I think I will put some in my office as well... why not! Thanks Amazon!
",0.93827903385,homeneeds,"They are the most beautiful candles I have and the best part is they never become old. The flicker inside them makes it look like a real candle and gives out light which is adjustable. It makes the room look so cozy and romantic. I placed it in my bedroom in the wall rack and now it makes for beautiful decor. Also, they are battery operatable with 3 small batteries in each. The remote can be used from a distance to instruct the candles to switch on/off and for brightness setting. They are very beautiful.
",0.93960225685,homeneeds,"We added rechargeable batteries to these candles. They look so nice! We’ll make a place on the mantle for these. I’m having 3 ceramic pots of varying height made to hold these. I got the idea from pictures on the box.

He's gonna have to suffer, though, because I'm going to save it for his Christmas stocking!  HahaIt's nice and bendy and plenty bright for evening reading.  It's got a neat paper cat bookmark, too.  I tried it out on a hardback book for some pictures.  Holds place nicely.  I know he's going to absolutely love this.
",0.92803883686,homeneeds,"I pretty much need book lights everywhere I go.  Some are a bit damaging to the pages, others are a bit too flimsy.  This one will work well as a bookmark style book light because of the thin profile.  That'll be nice for storage, not just for book light use.  It won't work quite as well for e-reader devices because of the style of the clip.  For us readers, you never really can have too many booklights though, and this one will do the trick. It also comes with a battery and comes in additional colors.

The light is an LED mounted on the cat’s forehead and the battery is mounted behind the cat’s face. The neck area is bendable to allow you to point the light at the angle that’s best for the reader.It comes with two batteries, so be sure to check the packaging. It also includes a cute little cat bookmark. Works well.

The loft bed is positioned in such a way that there is no good light source option for reading in bed and this was the purrrfect answer. Not only is it cute and holds on to the book well,  but it is surprisingly bright, so it really is better than I had imagined it would be. I have had similar sized booklights in the past and they are much more dim, but still passable to read by. This one is nice and bright, and the light can be easily directed to where it's needed.

I like this light because it takes awhile for my daughter to fall asleep so I’ve started a new bed time routine with her to get her to start relaxing.  It’s more relaxing to have the light turned off and have this light to read than her overhead light or task lamp.  I like that the head shifts down as well. We got the orange one and it’s super cute!

When someone cooks, the taste will rush into the room through the crack of the door. I don't like the taste of food in the bedroom. Since the installation of this roll, it's completely cut off the taste of food. I really think it's too practical. I decided to paste every door in the house.

This new weather strip has made a tremendous difference in the temperature of the room.  It was easy to apply and even enough to do a second door as well.  The adhesive is strong and application to the frame was simple.
",0.12584260187,homeneeds,"I got this adhesive seal for a couple of exterior doors that have gaps around them in their frames. Sticks on the doors well and helps a lot with cold air coming in those gaps.
",0.76627361888,homeneeds,"Took it out to test it for when we move to our new house next week. We want to have the holiday feel in our new home and this works perfectly without having to do Christmas lights all over the house.

",0.89315712589,homeneeds," Remote works awesomely!! Very bright! Vivid colors!
",0.86488008589,homeneeds,"I was a little worried that such a long string of LEDs wouldn't be as bright as the shorter strands I've used, but these held up just as bright as the short strips do and they gave off a lot more light. I used them in an environment where they competed with other colored lights from different sources, and they held up nicely and stood out in comparison. I'd recommend these for anybody looking to cover any large area with 1 controller device.
",0.7192384689,homeneeds,"I purchased these light. strips because I wanted a really long strip to go around the whole room. I was definitely satisfied with this purchase. My favorite part about it was the large variety of colors you can also lighten or darken them which was definitely a cool feature. The only part that I didn't enjoy was the long extension cord. It was long and bulky and really hard to hide since I don't like the bulkiness to show but luckily I was able to put it behind a drawer so that was an easy fix. Overall, it was a great product and I will most likely buy another for another one of my rooms. Definitely recommend!!!
",0.75597673789,homeneeds," I have led light everywhere and I love them. These are really well made, remote works from far away, they stick well and that makes them easy to mount and they're very bright. Awesome product!
",0.95152068189,homeneeds,"I just placed them behind my tv, they are very bright when you bump up the brightness  all the way up, you can change brightness really easy, change colors, build your own color and much more with ease with the remote control. Remote works from over 15' away without a problem. It comes with double sided tape and makes it very easy to install. Well built product and I highly reccomend it to everyone.
",0.87474489289,homeneeds,"Bought for a display cabinet. Works perfectly and the install was simple. The tape on the back stuck to the wood of my cabinet with minimal issues, just needed to press firmly and hold for a minute before moving down the line. There is also aditional clips with sticky backing which I recommend using to help stabilize. Overall no complaints, works exactly like I needed it to

",0.78449809689,homeneeds,"We have LED lights in our living room but we needed some for the bedroom. Turned out really well. Love the variety of colors and brightness. We bought a WiFi remote too so now we can control the lights from our phones. It’s like a makeshift Philips Hue
",0.92972046189,homeneeds,"This light is perfect for my place. I can adjust the brightness easily, the best part is the flash option which I didnt had the one in my last led strip. Quality is really good and easy to install, didnt even took more then 10min.
",0.89378386789,homeneeds,"I like how you cna change the brightness from very bright to very dim. The setting (like fade) look great. Also, you can make your own color default and they are very slim.
",0.94913423190,homeneeds,"We bought a 2 pack of these lights and thought if we didn't like them we'd just send them back. When we got the box it was super lightweight and smaller than expected so we thought maybe we'd made a mistake... until we screwed one into a light socket.  Holy cow, they're awesome!  Not only are they really bright but you can adjust the direction of each section. These are perfect for a workshop or garage without having to mount a special light kit.  Just replace the exiting bulb and you're done.  I just ordered two more.
",0.88849246590,homeneeds,"I’ve got two garages, each of which needed substantial organization following moving in. Unfortunately, with two little ones, it was hard to find time to work on it during daylight hours, and the single bulb out there made it impossible to do anything in the evening.  This bulb changed that.The output of light from these bulbs is stupendous. I’d highly recommend it for any garage, and since  it’s LED, you’re not running up a crazy electrical bill by using it.
",0.12780216390,homeneeds,"Wow, provided great amount of white light. I installed two units in a three car garage. The whole place lights up like daylight. Ability to direct the four side lights helps illuminate the walls and shelving in the garage.

",0.97685718590,homeneeds,"Awesome lights! Can not express enough how good of a deal these are.  It illuminates my entire garage and you can adjust the lights to either focus on a particular area or spread out over a broader area.  Highly recommend
",0.85880368990,homeneeds,"These lights are excellent! They have a far better appearance than other similar LEDs on Amazon and in most cases are a better price/lumen.
",0.97520250190,homeneeds,"I don't write reviews very often, but these lights are amazing! I wish I would have taken pictures of the difference between the two large light bulbs I had to these lights. I have them in my garage and now I can see everything in the garage, not just under the old lights. These are going to make working on projects so much easier because I can actually see what I am working on. I would not hesitate to buy these
",0.24031469290,homeneeds,"When I came home at night to park my car in the garage, my line of sight was dark and there was no light, so I bought this garage light so that the garage had plenty of light and could be turned on at night to illuminate everything around me, so I could park my home at home.

",0.76877224491,homeneeds,"My puppy occasionally has accidents that we can smell but can't find.  This seems to be a chronic problem when we have house sitters who don't understand how important it is to get the puppy outside regularly and not to over water it.  This blacklight flashlight makes tracking down any urine spots a snap, so we can treat them before they dry.  This is important because untreated accidents encourage visiting dogs to start marking the inside of your home.  Once the chaos starts it never seems to end.  So, addressing the problem quickly and thoroughly is essential.We also used it to find other spots throughout the house that were not obvious in daylight, such as where our painter dripped paint and didn't do a good job of cleaning up the spill.This blacklight flashlight uses 6 AA batteries inserted into 2 provided battery cartridges.  Follow instructions carefully to ensure the batteries and battery holders all get inserted in the correct orientation, which otherwise could damage the flashlight electronics.
",0.05085751491,homeneeds,"Hold on, if you think I'm a twisted kind of person that likes to be shamed, stop right there. I don't like to be shamed, but I do like that this light made me well aware of what was going on in my home.Initially I purchased this light because we moved to west Texas and I wanted to see if scorpions really glow under a black light. At 12:30Pm when the light arrived, I installed the batteries and looked around my house. What I found was gross. To the naked eye my house looks cleans. Family and friends that come over always compliment my home. Now, I am so grossed out by what I saw with this black light. As if looking along the baseboards weren't enough torture, I decided to check the area around my toilets.....BARF! The boys toilets were bad, I mean bad, bad, bad.....bad. But even my toilet that only I use was nasty. I thought I was a clean person.Seriously, if you want to take your cleaning to a whole new level, you need this light. It will shame you in ways you never thought you could be shamed. Of course all in pursuit of making you a cleaner person. :DIf you are wondering, it is true, scorpions really do glow under a black light.
",0.05720865791,homeneeds,"It works really well--so well that I will give you a warning:  it might cost you thousands of dollars, depending on the amount of carpet you have and your gross-out factor!  We were aghast at the pee spots that our puppy had made and I had missed when cleaning (our carpet is a beigy-color).  Under the light, we also saw scrubbed/treated areas from over ten years ago!  [There was a corner that I had soaked/treated with a very good enzymatic cleaner (Kids 'n Pets) that a bad kitty had peed in,  and even though the smell in this particular area was totally gone, and I've had professional carpet cleaners come in for normal cleanings, the area still showed 'positive' for urine!--FYI,  previously treated areas show as a lighter, smeary area, whereas untreated spots show up as much brighter with defined borders.) This light zeroed in with great detail--such as the 'dribble trail' left from a bigger puddle.  I bought this light because I couldn't get rid of a nasty dog urine smell despite tremendous effort to clean/sanitize. I 'm now treating the missed spots, but we are seriously considering replacing our carpet in our den and hallway because we are grossed-out knowing that all of these spots are really still there.

",0.87356913191,homeneeds,"First off let me say this light works very well, the quality seems durable with the metal case, it does take 6x AA batteries just a heads up. That being said i wish i never bought this, the amount of dirt and grime this picks up on kitchen counters and bathrooms is going to have me cleaning for months!
",0.09782582591,homeneeds,"I got this because we have added a kitten to our house and I wanted to make sure he only was using the litter box. It works great. Even my 2year old grandson was happy to shine it at the floor to help.

I seriously went around the house finding either past cat vomit stains or hairball stains (a very different shape and pattern).  I also found where my cousins dogs peed on the carpet.  I cannot see these without the black light and I thought everything is fine.  Now I feel like the filth in my home can only be cleansed with fire... or maybe just replace all the carpets with hardwood, laminate, or tile.
",0.07557228291,homeneeds,"I bought this for my wife.  We live in SW Texas and have had several scorpions in the house this spring.  she's kind of freaked out by them and wanted something to keep an eye out for them before bed.

",0.84662485192,homeneeds,"These lightbulbs are awesome. I'm definitely going to be buying more of these. I love the different settings and how you can control the brightness. Works perfectly for being able to read at night but not having the bright light on to keep you up. I love that I can use my Alexa to turn the light on or off. Super convenient. I would recommend to anyone.
",0.97585815292,homeneeds,"The best thing about this light bulb is that you can use it with Alexa and it doesn’t  require a hub! This is exactly what I was looking for. It’s highly adjustable and programmable.

",0.8908933493,homeneeds,no review,0.72744357194,homeneeds,"Picked up one of these to try with my Hue lights. It is a single button, about half the size of a marshmallow and close to the same color. Nice smooth rubbery feeling finish to it. There is a magnet built into the back so you can attach it to any magnetic surface easily. The ""wall plate"" can be mounted with screws (not included) or the two attached sticky strips, and the button will stick to the center of that as well. As a final option it comes with a disc that can attach with included double-sided tape and the button will stick to that as well. There is a picture pamphlet that directs you how to set up the button with or WITHOUT a hub. The Amazon description is incorrect stating that a hub is required, but without a hub you can only pair it to a single hue bulb and functionality is limited.Pairing with a hub will allow you to customize functionality between a quick press, a longer press, or press-and-hold along with setting which lights or room you want to control with it.Pretty simple to set up and use, I like the fact that it is not fixed in place and can be easily moved around. It can also be easily lost, and looks like a good target for pets, or small children, who want something to chew on! You can have it in any color you like, as long as it is white, and I do not think you can easily paint the surface (would probably rub right off). For $20 it isn't bad, but for $5 more you can get the dimmer switch which has more functionality at a slightly larger size. I can recommend this switch to anyone who wants a compact, basic function, wireless Hue switch.
",0.88304245594,homeneeds,"Its nice that it’s magnetic and can stick to an existing wall plate (for example right on a metal screw). The odd thing about holding down on the Smart Button, you have 3 options. Either dim lights in the room you’ve configured it in. Do nothing. Or turn off ALL of your lights, in your entire Hue ecosystem. There isn’t a option is configure it to just a specific room or zone. I’m sure they’ll fix this in a future software update. But until then 3 stars max.
",0.594,homeneeds,"Purchased three, all three arrived with dead batteries. One appeared to be working the led blinked to initiate pairing but the battery strength was too weak for it to pair with my system, huge waste of time. After replacing a battery and getting one paired it doesn't work well. The button is magnetic and I hoped to place it on a metal door frame. When placed on metal the signal doesn't travel even when the top of the button has a sight line to my hub. In my experience it only works well when standing away from walls. As a single button you may be expecting to pair this with a single bulb but it can only be linked to a room or full system. Be ready for more work configuring your system to integrate a button that will very likely arrive dead or work infrequently.
",0.03594213794,homeneeds,"Do not buy. Very limited HomeKit integration. Only Single Press can be configured in HomeKit. Hue automations cannot be disabled. Great hardware. Terrible software integration.
",0.066988294,homeneeds,"Works great, I've got mine set to cycle through a few scenes on short presses and cycle dimming on button hold...slapped it under my coffee table.Would be nice if it came with at least one extra magnetic disc...I'd like that over the larger baseplate I'll not use.

",0.88717609696,homeneeds," I never write reviews but this seriously blew my mind.As someone who has company over in our garage during the summers, I got tired of the weak light that the door opener motor was emitting.I almost pulled the trigger to get a contractor to come and install strip lighting until I found this thing.Even after reading other people’s reviews, I still can’t believe how great this light is.It’s about as easy to install as it gets and I will be buying it for my parents as well.
",0.22454416896,homeneeds,"I replaced a CFL in my garage. I am impressed with the quality and construction of this light.The light is very bright. I have ordered the 8000 lumens for another area of my garage.FYI I am a Master Electrician and know a little about lights.This is a great light so far.
",0.87926757396,homeneeds,"Just received this about 20 minutes ago. Ordered it yesterday (Prime is amazing). Our garage has only two ceiling fixture outlets and always felt dark. I replaced an EarthBulb LED rated at 9 watts and 810 lumen of light output. It was a much warmer 2700K bulb (aka yellowish). Replacing it with this LED garage light was as easy as changing any other bulb; it took about 30 seconds. As you can see in the before and after pictures, this bulb definitely throws more light and is considerably ""whiter."" I'm pleased. Now I just need another one for the other side of the garage...Of course, I can't yet speak to the longevity. This light is heavy in comparison to a standard LED however and certainly feels well made. Time will tell, and I will update my review of anything funky happens with the light.Oh, and I found a USB powered fan included in the box. Totally random and unexpected, but I kind of like it. The kids are having fun working up the courage to touch its oscillating blades of fury.
",0.89423382396,homeneeds,"I've been using light as bright as I can get it for years now to help reduce seasonal depression in winter, and gave this a shot.  It's very well made, and the aluminum panels are superb heat sinks.  It gives off BEAUTIFUL light, and lots of it -- color rendition is superb.  It's not very large, nor is it very heavy -- rigged up on an old mike stand, I can easily move it around and yet not have to worry about it being too tippy due to excessive weight.And since it's not omnidirectional if you don't want it to be, it does well at concentrating all that lovely light right where it needs to be.  This would work well for photography also -- the light coloring isn't nastily blue/violet like some cheap lamps.  I'm perfectly pleased with this, all around.

",0.811782396,homeneeds,"So been looking for someway to enhance the light in my dark garage that has a very high ceiling. Currently I've got 100W equivalent florescent curly bulbs, 4 of them. Figured this LED light with 3 directional light sources, and putting out 6000 lumens (compared to a florescent bulbs 1100) might fit the bill. Man it sure does. it really adds light to the space. I'm going to be buying 3 more to replace the other florescent bulbs now that I know the LED light works as advertised.  One side note, interesting ""Transformers Autobot"" motif to it, but it's way up on the ceiling so the cartoon aesthetic is moot.
",0.84655344596,homeneeds,"Needed more light in my garage and thought I would try one of these after seeing them FB. The price on FB was twice the price of on here so ordered one from here to try. I'm really pleased with the results as I have two regular light sockets in my oversize two car garage and I have 4 florescent tube light fixtures that they don't make the bulbs for anymore. One of these put out enough light to cover half of my garage and I plan on buying another one now to replace the other regular 100 watt bulb I have and get rid of the florescent lighting all together. Besides being super bright lights the lighting is adjustable so that you can angle the LEDs to shine where you want them.
",0.2327301596,homeneeds,"Love having 3 car garage, but the lighting was awful.  A single, standard light bulb above each parking spot.  I decided to try these first before going with florescent fixtures, and I'm glad I did.  Only replaced 2 of the light bulbs to test this and they are so bright I dont think I'll even need a third.  Problem solved for $90 and install as easy as changing a light bulb.
",0.17915722796,homeneeds,"I've just installed six of these in our 3-bay garage. They replaced 100W equivalent CREE LED bulbs (which were very good), but these pretty much double the lighting (as measured by a Lightmeter app on my phone). I had been considering using LED Fluorescent tube replacements, but saw these and bought one pair initially. Once installed I had to get 4 more for the rest of the garage. It is a lot easier to install these than the hanging shop light fittings.They are very bright (and a clear white color) - but that's what I wanted, as the garage is primarily a workshop used for working on our classic cars. The ceiling is about 10 feet high.I didn't reverse the wings (as some others have done), but did title them down at about a 45' angle.One thing I did notice - the light is very directional, and if there's metal work in the way (garage door openers for example) there was a very noticeable shadow when I only had the two lights fitted. But with all six replaced that pretty much lights the garage evenly.Definitely recommend them if you need to light a work area brightly, and have existing screw in bulb fittings.

They can be controlled by a controller that it is included and also you can change how the lights blink. It is easy to install you should simply plug the connector to the rope light and afterward into the divider. The lights don't have any tape. It is also a good gift for people who enjoy this kind of lights or might want to upgrade something in their home because it comes in a box rather than a plastic bag and they give you additional parts just in case you might need them.
",0.96755719299,homeneeds,"I needed something for my room. I had wires going everywhere and some didn’t have anything to plug into. I got sick and tired of switching out plugs. I got this and mounted it on my wall. Got my stuff organized. What I loved about this is it had usb. I don’t have to waste a plug in with a brick. Has surge protection and you can flip it on and off to shit down power to everything. Great product!

If you buys one you will never buy the old style again,if you need wall mount.
",0.92233014199,homeneeds,"I know its simple and might seem small, but i've had so many headaches with trying to mount surge protectors on my walls with the holes on the back or underside.  These little mounting tabs on the outside being easily accessible are literally everything.  I love them and mounted it under my desk with ease.  Little things, big impact.The unit itself is great. Sturdy, looks really good, delivers as expected.  Total Win.  I'll probably only buy these from now on.
",0.80605214899,homeneeds,"I chose this product because it used larger wires in the cord so it could handle the 15 amp rating of my air fryer oven.  I also liked the mounting tabs on each corner and that it had an on/off switch.  It is very well made.  It says it has surge protector circuitry.
",0.82417893499,homeneeds,"Really nice surge protector.  It has plenty of places to plug in and they are spaced far which apart to all be used, even with relatively large plugs. The USB ports are very helpful for charging electronics.  Most importantly, it has a flat plug.  Just what we needed.

When I got this devices is was perfect for my entertainment set up. It allowed be to plug in everything I needed while having all the ports available no matter the size of my adapters. This power strip also has built in mounting brackets and I used them to screw into my entertainment stand to have better cable management. The USB ports are an added bonus to help charge less power demanding options such as controllers.
",0.21219086699,homeneeds,"I bought this for my guestroom. We have a a duplex outlet with the need for more plugs. I  wanted a power strip that I could attached to the wall. This was easy to do that. Just what I needed.
",0.86778622999,homeneeds,"Compact.  I can plug in large pliugs next to each other without crowding.  I can plug in everything I need for my entertainment center.
",0.599,homeneeds,"I’ve become a big fan of Trond Surge Protectors. Purchased one last year for my nightstand with outlets & USB ports, continues to work real well and therefore purchased similar for my other nightstand. That said, I’ve purchased this model to support my entertainment center, works well that enables me to plug my cell phone to charge and also has a slim plug that allows me to push my entertainment center plus up against the wall. Thank you Trond.

",0.877731919100,homeneeds,"There are few things more annoying than encountering a stripped or damaged screw when you're working on a project. I can't tell you how many times I've worked on a car or home project and screwed (no pun intended) something up in the process and couldn't remove the screw. So annoying because instead of having one problem, now you have two! I came across this screw extractor kit and gave it a try. I have to say that I'm very happy with it and I've already removed a few screws that I previously thought were goners. This kit came with 22 pieces, and extension bit holder, and a socket adapter all for a very affordable price. Very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone needing to unscrew themselves.
",0.167600662100,homeneeds,"Complete set to fix screws heads. I had one in my 1978 bike. The stud was rusty and using this tools you just need to. Small studs. Medium studs. So you do a hole using the tool diameter needed rotating to the left then use the correct tool to unscrew the bad screw.
",0.192442387100,homeneeds,"This item had give me mixed feelings. After so many failed attempts of removing a stripped screw I just went for it. I gave it a try, and it worked perfectly for me. I have only used the product one time. I was in the process of changing a doorknob and notice that several of the screws were stripped. The screws came out slow and easy. I was amazed how well it worked.
",0.893538952100,homeneeds,"Some people complained that the smaller bits will not fit the holder.  That's true, but there is an adapter in the slot marked ADP that installs in the holder, and will take the smaller bits.  There were no instructions with the kit I got, which is why some people might have missed that.Down rated a star because there is some wobble, but it doesn't seem to matter much.
",0.126884133100,homeneeds,"My husband used to remove a treated deck screw. He said he turned the starter bit the wrong way which may explain a bit of damage to the bit. However it bored deep enough for the extractor bit to catch and remove the screw with ease. Used an electric impact driver which was a bit tough to control extraction speed. This set had a great selection to chose from.
",0.129728496100,homeneeds," This set works perfectly with any of my drills. I showed that it fits with my m18 Milwaukee drill with no issues. Great set to have and keep it somewhere. You will find that they are super useful when you need them. This will help you get the damaged screws out without destroying your surface.
",0.936760664100,homeneeds,"These are total garbage.  Snapped one and spent an hour plus drilling it out.  I thought maybe because I was using the drill the first time it applied too much torque.  Wrong.  I did it by hand the second time and it snapped again threading it in by hand with basically no torque.  This makes the problem of a broken bolt worse because the extractor ends up stuck in the screw hole and it is extremely difficult to drill out.  May as well have thrown my money in the trash and added another hand full of bills for my time.
",0.021538138100,homeneeds,"This screw extractor set is really compact and nice. It has all different sizes of screws. We always break the screw on the furnitures when we assembled or disassemble. This extractor set is really help us to remove the damaged screw. Turning left is to remove to the screw profile, and turning right is to remove the screw. It takes time to remove those damaged screws, but it works.
",0.049641371100,homeneeds,"I damaged a screw in my door and bought this online. It arrived very quickly and was useful right away. It made it easy to remove the damaged screw. I'm keeping this set for future use. I love the little casing it comes in. It makes it easy to store.

",0.9640178681,petsupplies,"I am constantly trying different brands to control the funkadelia coming out of my cat, he's a tank with an appetite, his business is SERIOUS...and this stuff WORKS. I scoop periodically throughout the week and change the box completely every 10-14 days with this stuff. NO STANK! He has an XL box with a lid, so i dump 2/3 of the box in all at once when i change his litter out. He cant wait to get in there and mark it, and I don't smell anything but febreeze when he starts kickin and diggin around. Pee clumps solid and poop dries up firm, so it's super-easy to scoop out without trashing the good litter around it. That saves me time and money, win-win!!
",0.7794170381,petsupplies,"I've tried several brands of cat litter. None clump as well as Fresh Step (all varieties). I've also previously used non-clumping litter for my cats, but believe that clumping litter is more sanitary since it allows for liquid waste to also be removed from the box. I never have issues with odor. The litter is lightly scented but it's not unpleasant to me. Nor does it seem to bother my cats sensitive sense of smell. Highly recommend.
",0.1614541411,petsupplies,"I’ve had cats all my life but they were always indoor/outdoor cats so we never used a litter box. We just recently took in a stray in our new home. Since he has to stay indoors for at least two weeks I just purchased this litter to get him through the weeks. I was so worried he was going to stink up our new home. I thought maybe he wasn’t using it, but when I pushed the litter around I realized he had been using it. This stuff covers smell GREAT and doesn’t give off a a super powerful “good” smell. The bathroom it’s in smells like nothing basically. It also clumps very strongly into urine so when you clean it it nothing but clean litter is left. This stuff is amazing.
",0.1248528361,petsupplies,"First great thing about this litter? It's cheap! Second? It smells great and masks all odors. I used one box to fill both my large and small litter pan. First couple days, my female kitten wouldn't go near it; she chose to pee outside in the rain instead. By the fourth day, I caught my large male using the box, which he hasn't done in almost 6 months! (Indoor/Outdoor kitties.) The grains are a little larger than they are used to, but it surprisingly has stopped the incessant digging my female usually does. Overall, I am quite pleased and will definitely continue buying! Did I mention that it smells awesome? 😂
",0.7595280411,petsupplies,"I LOVE this stuff. I'm never going back to plain unscented litter. We have a small bathroom, which is unfortunately the only place that we can keep my cat's litter pan at the moment. Despite that, her box doesn't stink it up, and dare I say, it actually smells pleasant. It also does a fantastic job at clumping, and has little dust.
",0.7858692411,petsupplies,"This is the best litter ever. We have 2 cats, they share 1 box, this stuff is great! Old litter was rancid in like 2 days with 2 cats, you don't notice this stuff smelling for like 5-7 days for our use, which is awesome! I bet with one cat it wouldn't smell for atleast a full weak, which is pretty good. They all say they achieve that in advertising, but the others i have encountered, do not achieve it. I think this litter would, as its pretty much doing it with 2 cats. Color me  impressed!like getting from amazon so I don't have to lug it thru the grocery store, the price point is very good with free shipping.
",0.9238429071,petsupplies,"This is the absolute best cat litter I have ever used it eliminates odor. It clumps well, which makes cleaning the litter box a breeze! And no unsightly odor, or gagging involved! I have been sold on this for a long time. And with Prime I simply have it shipped to my door. No more lugging it in and out of the car at the market! Easy peasy! It’s a no brainer.
",0.9297094351,petsupplies,"This cat litter seemed just fine but our cat is diabetic and at times drinks and pees a large quantity and he does not cover his waste very well.  This litter did not clump well enough and is not scented enough to help.  We only have one cat but his pees are large and we had puddling on top of the portion that would clump. So we're back to Tidy Cats but we have used this litter before with another cat years ago and it was just fine.  I only took one star off for the lack of clumping for large quantities, just didn't work well enough for our current pet.
",0.1842823331,petsupplies,"The clumping on this litter is wonderful, but the dust and the smell - horrible! I don't know why it is so difficult to find a litter with good clumping and odor control without making you feel like you are in a french ***house or a construction site.
",0.0680821841,petsupplies,"The reviews of this product were very accurate. This is an excellent product.  It clumps nicely, hides the odor, and doesn't leave a film of litter in the air whenever you clean it.  I changed to this litter because my old litter was leaving a nasty smell and it's particles would leave me gagging whenever I cleaned it.  So much happier with this product.  Also, you can buy it in one big litter box, and in a box with multiple packets that are easy to transport.  I will definitely be sticking with this company.

If you are looking for the ultra tough toys, you won't find them at this price for sure. The rope toys are solid though and come in various configurations. Those alone are worth the price. My dog really loves them. Also, it comes packaged in a bag with a pull tie and is really nice looking. It would make an excellent puppy gift. I will probably get a second set for that purpose.

I will be very diligent with watching him with the other toys.  I’m nervous about giving him the other non rope chew toys - especially if they are made from the same material.***update*** After posting this, the company fully refunded me.

",0.8442362556,petsupplies,"This pet heating pad/bed warmer comes compactly rolled up and packaged in a 12"" rectangular box that must be kept for warranty purposes. There is a pvc/plastic odor upon unboxing, but it dissipates within 10 minutes once the heating pad is opened up. The black chew-resistant cord seems quite sturdy, and the zipper glides open and shut with ease to remove the cover. The timer is large and the print is easy to read. The timer lights glow brightly, making it so simple to monitor heat levels and time segments. The on/off button is an ideal size and functions smoothly.Within 30 seconds of laying the heating pad out on the sofa, all four of the cats came to investigate. The big tomcat claimed it first, and as you can see in the photo, he luxuriated in the warmth and comfort. I had to lift him off so that each of the  Maine Coon girls could have a chance. Each of them lasted a just few minutes before their eyes started to droop. They, too, had to be coaxed and lifted off the pad. The poor little tuxedo kitty has not even gotten a chance to try it out - the other three are keeping a rotation going on it.  Clearly, as winter approaches, I will have to purchase a few more of these (i.e. one for each of their beds).I have seen similar heating pads in the pet store, but their price is 2-3 times higher than this one.This bed warmer is a real winner and I highly recommend it.  Make sure to register your heating pad with Lesotc as they offer an extra 6 months on the warranty if you do so (total of 18 months warranty).
",0.56,petsupplies,"A couple months ago we got our first yorkie puppy, Lily Belle. I was concerned because our house can get pretty cold in the evenings and as someone who runs hot all the time I wanted to ensure that my puppy was nice and warm. This heating pad does just that! She was a little reluctant at first as she tends to be. At first she’s only put her paws on it, but once she realized it wasn’t going to bite her she made quick use of it as seen in the pictures. What makes this pet heating pad more ideal vs a regular heating pad is the chew-proof cord. Lily Belle is in a teething phase and likes to chew on most things, so that feature is very helpful during this time. I also like the fact that you can adjust the heat accordingly but it doesn’t get too hot that she runs the risk of overheating. It also has a timer on it which gives me peace of mind that it’s not running all day. I never thought I’d have a new for a specific pet heating pad but I am delighted I purchased this one. Happy pup means happy life.
",0.8754734996,petsupplies,"My dog is loving this pet heating pad! She is always cold and shivers when it is under 65 degrees, so when I set the heating pad down and turn it on, she comes running! The material seems to be high quality and the cover is soft. The cord seems very durable and although my dog is not a chewer, I’m sure it would deter dogs from chewing on it. Even though the cord has a hard covering, it is still very moveable and isn’t stiff which is nice, plus it’s a good length for reaching from the wall to the couch. The “control panel” is really nice and has a lot of setting options. (My dog seems to favor heat setting #3 thus far.) I also like how you can set a timer in case you happen to forget and leave it on for a while. As you can see in the photos, the size is perfect for my 15-pound pup and she even can use it in her bed or as a top cover to create a “bed cave.”  I would recommend this pet heating pad.
",0.7928835156,petsupplies,"My cats are always using my heating pad during the winter. It gets really cold where I live and they always seem to be cold. I felt it was time to get them their own heating pad! I can say it was not a mistake. They absolutely love this heating pad and are often caught trying to share it. I will definitely have to order more of these or bigger ones! The heating pad has a lot of perks to it. First, it's easy to set up and use. It does not get too hot to where it could harm my pets or burn them like a regular heating pad would.  It has a nice timer that can easily be set to turn off the heating pad after a period of time.  The heating pad is nicely lined and soft and feels like a pet bed, which may be why they like it so much when it's not even turned on. Lastly, the cord is very durable. It does not seem like they would ever be able to chew through it. My pets do not do this anyway, but just in the event yours do, it seems to have a protective layer to prevent that risk. Overall, it's a wonderful product for cold pets. I highly recommend it!!
",0.2242260586,petsupplies,"I purchased this pet heating pad because every year, my dogs like to snuggle under the blanket with me and make it hard for me to move at night.  I have 3 dogs and 2 of them always are under the blankets.  This is a great pad, I lay it on the foot of my bed and with the long cord, it was easy for them to sleep on it, while still being close to me!  The first night, they stayed on it most of the night.  Does not get too hot for them at all!  The only problem with it is that they love it so much, I may have to buy a few more!  The cover is very soft and nice material, easy to wipe clean and to use a roller if too furry.  Also great that it is removable so that I can wash or replace as needed!  It rolls up nice and small so when not using, can store easily.It is good size heating pad for my small and medium sized dogs.  The biggest one is about 30 pounds and very tall, but he can fit his body on it.
",0.7959712746,petsupplies,"I foster kittens and puppies and this is a nice, large pet heating pad for them.  It has multiple heat settings and time settings so that you don’t have to remember to turn it off.  So far they have loved it and I find my dog along with the kittens sleeping on it.  It is really nice that the cord is chew proof so that their sharp little teeth don’t go through it.  I recently got a catio and this will be perfect outside for the cooler weather to keep the cat warm.  I am so glad to have found this and would definitely recommend it.
",0.9389506586,petsupplies,"This is well thought out pet warming pad. Perfect size for a cat or small dog. The cord is a good length and allows me to put it just about anywhere. I love the fact that they covered the cord to reduce the chances of a pet biting into the wires.This one has 6 heat levels and you can set it for 4, 8, 12, or 24 hours. The cover is removable so you can wash it but I will end up putting a towel over it to keep it clean.The only problem is that I will need another one because my first cat, aka The Boss, will not let my other cat near it...seriously she growls at him like a gremlin.If you are looking for something to keep your pet warm this winter this is the product to get in my opinion.
",0.7592735296,petsupplies,"I love this heating pad. I like the bigger size much better than the smaller ones I've used in the past. My yellow lab and pit mix like to lay on it as well as all my cats! The control panel is great too. I didn't need to read instructions to figure it out like others I've had. This one is self explanatory and large enough to see easily. Really makes this a good heating pad. I keep it on my bed for the cats to use and it's perfect for keeping my spot warm when I get into bed at night. I'm going to buy another one for each of my cats.
",0.9711321596,petsupplies,"Works really well! It fits 2 of them on it very comfortably. My cats love to lay on it even when it’s not on. It heats up pretty fast and the remote is very easy to use. The pad and remote are of very good quality. I wished it’d get just a bit warmer, but all 3 of my cats seems to love it nonetheless so no complaints here! I definitely recommend it for anyone with furbabies who like just lounging around like mine lol
",0.8730525976,petsupplies,"It's November here in Florida and it's about 65 degree's which is pretty cold. I'm sure up North that temperature isn't, but to us, yep...Any way, my 13 year old Persian cat suffers with Spinal Arthritis and I can see her moving slower now compared to the hot months so I'm sure she's in pain because of the temperature drop. I bought her this electric heating pad and as soon as I plugged it in, she went to lay on it. I wasn't sure if she would like it as she's a window cat, but low and behold she seems to really like it, especially since it most probably helps releive the Arthritic pain.Although it came with directions, I didn't need to read them, it was simple enough. Turn it on, and adjust the temperature  (level 1 to 6) Boom, that's it. Oh and their is also an automatic switch off for 4-8-12 or 24 hours, I'm using the 12 hour one.The only thing is that their really is no thick padding, you may have to purchase that separate, there's just blue material with the heater inside. Still, she likes it as is, so were both happy.Great for all cats, especially older ones with ailments, very comforting for them, especially during Winter months.

",0.8351334337,petsupplies,"Last year, we bought the older version of this ultrasonic bark controller (believe its still available on Amazon) at the recommendation of a friend that had used one.  Without it, our neighbor's yappy little Scotties will drive you insane.  We had such great success with the older model, that we purchased the newer model recently.  The results with the newer model have been identical to the older one.  When the dogs yap, we simply point the device toward them and push the button.  It gets their attention, they go quiet, and then run up to their deck.......booyah!  No more yapping for awhile.  Maximum range on it seems to be about 30 - 40 feet for the yappers.  Honestly, your results and ""effective"" range will vary depending upon how sensitive the target dog is to the sound produced.  Luckily for us, the Scotties (non-affectionately deemed ""The Sh%*Heads""......which also goes for their owners) seem to be very sensitive to the sound, so range seems to work a little further than advertised on them.  We have tried it on a few larger breed dogs and it only seems to get their attention if they are closer than 25-30 feet.  This has been a useful tool for us, and we now own three.  We keep one at each entrance door to the house.  That way, when the yappers begin their hysterical rant, we can grab the MODUS, step out the door, and put and end to the irritation.
",0.7179016477,petsupplies,"I have the previous model, and liked it very much. This model seemed to have a better range. I have to use it on my neighbors dogs, as they bark for hours on end! 1 or 2 zaps of sound, and I can enjoy my backyard!

Just a click and he stopped and sat down or ran away.  Now I just say no and hold it up if he gets too excited and he calms right down!

He is wonderful but has a problem barking at everything that passes our house. I was so tired of yelling all the time and was desperate for help. This thing is AMAZING! the moment he starts barking I say his command word and hit the button. It distracts him enough that he just sits and stares. I have been consistent for the last few days making sure I hit the button when he barks. I finally have my voice back and don't have to tell anymore.

",0.8520137078,petsupplies,"Even though I purchased this for some of my patients at my various clinics, the pet that loved it the most was my blind dog!  Despite bouncing through my kitchen and down my stairs, this bad boy has taken beating and kept on rolling!  Easy to clean exterior and super fast charge were both benefits.  Works the best on non-carpeted areas but still did perform on low pile carpets.
",0.8046472078,petsupplies,"Got this for our new kitten. It works great, the ball is about 2 inches wide and it moves quickly. The can and my kids love it, and chase it around for hours. Easy to turn on and off just a push button that even my one year old can use. It's a wonderful cat toy.
",0.9712606678,petsupplies,"My cats love this! They go crazy over the light and this moves well! I was shocked by how far it will roll, impressive. The cats bat this thing around too! It fell down our steps and still works perfect! This is a great cat toy!
",0.8636457928,petsupplies,"So this product seemed nice, however when I turn it on it always rolls around for about 20-30 seconds before stopping because it either hit a groove in the floor or rolled straight into a wall or sometimes for no discernible reason. My 3 cats start to get interested in it and then it just stops randomly, and they lose interest. I tried it on short carpet, tile floors, and wooden floors. Only reliable on wooden floors and even then it just goes into a wall and stops. Very disappointedWould definitely not recommend for cat owners. It might be okay for dog owners as hitting it can re-calibrate it to start moving again, but my cats had no desire to do so
",0.1591008019,petsupplies,"Needed a toy for my dog who plays constantly.This is well made, with a very strong suction cup. It doesn't pull up easy (there is a little tab that lets your remove it when you need to though).Great toy for your tug of war lover, or a dog who wants to constantly play.
",0.9175268419,petsupplies,"My dog is obsessed, she like a strong rubber toys, specially if they have a rob, she likes to pull to play and see who is stronger. As soon as I got it I opened and started playing with it. I used the cup to stick it in the bottom part of the glass table to make her reach it. It was fun for her to trying to pull the ball from the table. Is a great toy to let your dog play by themselves.
",0.9368944769,petsupplies,"Ok, so this took a lot of manipulation to get the cup to form a shape that would allow it to get a good suction. My best recommendation would be to take a high heat blow dryer to it that will do the job a lot quicker than the various methods I tried. Overall the dogs love it and after a week the rope still has not frayed! Impressed!
",0.9549723869,petsupplies,"This dog toy is exactly what I was looking for. It does just what the description says. It sticks perfectly to smooth tile (it does not stick to textured tile) and holds up well to biting and tugging from your relentless puppy. The toy is easy to remove from tile when needed and rinses clean !

",0.95573449110,petsupplies,"This is a pretty awesome gadget right here! It has three light modes whereas you can use the white, blue, and the red. When on the red mode there are five different shapes you can use as well which gives a total of seven different modes. It’s small enough to keep on me if I needed as there is a little clip you can use to attach it on your pocket if desired. I would have to say the coolest part of this is the way you charge it as you can use almost any USB charging port, which I find very awesome because I don’t need another wire added to all my others and I can connect it with my phone charger or laptop! Kudos for making this thing as my dog really has fun playing with it! I would recommend this to anyone wanting to have a little quality time with their pets be it a cat, dog, or bird 😊
",0.98493105210,petsupplies,"This is a wonderful toy. I received it quickly, and was packaged well. It comes in a nice case so I can keep it up when not in use. I love that it has 3 different lights, the laser pointer, a blue light and a flashlight. It has a switch which allows you to turn the pinpoint red laser into a star, butterfly, smiley face and a little mouse shape. It's super cute! Definitely worth the price. My kids love using it as well, it's so easy to switch on and through the different lights and shapes. To make it even more convenient the battery is rechargeable, it has a USB that you can plug right in to any wall outlet. I highly recommend this product. It's a lot of fun.
",0.99453967810,petsupplies," My cats and dogs both absolutely love this laser!! My cats can play for hours if my dogs will let them haha.

We love this and will repurchase if ever needed.
",0.92884945910,petsupplies," We love the light! As you can hear in the video I posted my 3 year old wants it! She loves making shadows on the wall and with this you get a flash light, a lower light and the laser with different shapes. My daughter plays with the dog with it, and he loves chasing it too! It’s a win win in our house! You never have to worry about changing batteries, you just charge it and the charge last awhile!
",0.93785852210,petsupplies,"So this charges with a USB which hides under a cap. It has a standard laser pointer which comes in a metal storage case and has a little wheel on the side which changes the laser design to some orb alien looking thing or a start or a smiley face. It also has a mode where you can use it as a flash light. My dog looks at it and tries to catch his little red dot, keeps him occupied for a bit.
",0.73180735110,petsupplies,"I love the pet laser light it has a USB charger so no worries about shorts in a charging cord. Love all the different shapes for the laser light.

",0.95908939810,petsupplies,"This is very entertaining. My wife's cat loves chasing the light around. It has 3 different lights:  white, blue and the red laser light. With the laser light it also has 5 different designs that can be used: mouse, star, butterfly, smiley face and the standard pointer. All are very bright. The cat loves chasing it around. Also came with a small mouse that he loves to throw around and play with on his own. My wife is extremely happy with it.
",0.9813944110,petsupplies,"This is the best laser pen we bought. Third time is a charm. Has a nice variety and all the designs are bright and holds a charge for several days. I really like how you can recharge via usb instead of batteries. And the free mouse toy included was a hit. Our kitty loves them. Thank you for great products.
",0.9837990410,petsupplies,"This the best cat toy I ever bought, hours of entertainment and it doubles as a flashlight and key fob. She was crazy before and nuttier now. I like the flashlight function; great for you if you get up in the middle of the night and not stub your toe.Lights are bright and laser point is irresistible. I especially like that the batteries are replaceable. I find it less ergonomically sound for thumb joint than my previous mouse laser pointer.
",0.88708168310,petsupplies," I can't stop laughing when I get this out and play with the cats! They all 5 take turns trying to get the light and spin in circles chasing it. It is just so funny! They love it, and it's great excercise!

",0.8437194812,petsupplies,"This pet heating pad/bed warmer comes compactly rolled up and packaged in a 12"" rectangular box that must be kept for warranty purposes. There is a pvc/plastic odor upon unboxing, but it dissipates within 10 minutes once the heating pad is opened up. The black chew-resistant cord seems quite sturdy, and the zipper glides open and shut with ease to remove the cover. The timer is large and the print is easy to read. The timer lights glow brightly, making it so simple to monitor heat levels and time segments. The on/off button is an ideal size and functions smoothly.Within 30 seconds of laying the heating pad out on the sofa, all four of the cats came to investigate. The big tomcat claimed it first, and as you can see in the photo, he luxuriated in the warmth and comfort. I had to lift him off so that each of the  Maine Coon girls could have a chance. Each of them lasted a just few minutes before their eyes started to droop. They, too, had to be coaxed and lifted off the pad. The poor little tuxedo kitty has not even gotten a chance to try it out - the other three are keeping a rotation going on it.  Clearly, as winter approaches, I will have to purchase a few more of these (i.e. one for each of their beds).I have seen similar heating pads in the pet store, but their price is 2-3 times higher than this one.This bed warmer is a real winner and I highly recommend it.  Make sure to register your heating pad with Lesotc as they offer an extra 6 months on the warranty if you do so (total of 18 months warranty).
",0.512,petsupplies,"A couple months ago we got our first yorkie puppy, Lily Belle. I was concerned because our house can get pretty cold in the evenings and as someone who runs hot all the time I wanted to ensure that my puppy was nice and warm. This heating pad does just that! She was a little reluctant at first as she tends to be. At first she’s only put her paws on it, but once she realized it wasn’t going to bite her she made quick use of it as seen in the pictures. What makes this pet heating pad more ideal vs a regular heating pad is the chew-proof cord. Lily Belle is in a teething phase and likes to chew on most things, so that feature is very helpful during this time. I also like the fact that you can adjust the heat accordingly but it doesn’t get too hot that she runs the risk of overheating. It also has a timer on it which gives me peace of mind that it’s not running all day. I never thought I’d have a new for a specific pet heating pad but I am delighted I purchased this one. Happy pup means happy life.
",0.875473512,petsupplies,"My dog is loving this pet heating pad! She is always cold and shivers when it is under 65 degrees, so when I set the heating pad down and turn it on, she comes running! The material seems to be high quality and the cover is soft. The cord seems very durable and although my dog is not a chewer, I’m sure it would deter dogs from chewing on it. Even though the cord has a hard covering, it is still very moveable and isn’t stiff which is nice, plus it’s a good length for reaching from the wall to the couch. The “control panel” is really nice and has a lot of setting options. (My dog seems to favor heat setting #3 thus far.) I also like how you can set a timer in case you happen to forget and leave it on for a while. As you can see in the photos, the size is perfect for my 15-pound pup and she even can use it in her bed or as a top cover to create a “bed cave.”  I would recommend this pet heating pad.
",0.7928835212,petsupplies,"My cats are always using my heating pad during the winter. It gets really cold where I live and they always seem to be cold. I felt it was time to get them their own heating pad! I can say it was not a mistake. They absolutely love this heating pad and are often caught trying to share it. I will definitely have to order more of these or bigger ones! The heating pad has a lot of perks to it. First, it's easy to set up and use. It does not get too hot to where it could harm my pets or burn them like a regular heating pad would.  It has a nice timer that can easily be set to turn off the heating pad after a period of time.  The heating pad is nicely lined and soft and feels like a pet bed, which may be why they like it so much when it's not even turned on. Lastly, the cord is very durable. It does not seem like they would ever be able to chew through it. My pets do not do this anyway, but just in the event yours do, it seems to have a protective layer to prevent that risk. Overall, it's a wonderful product for cold pets. I highly recommend it!!
",0.2242260612,petsupplies,"I purchased this pet heating pad because every year, my dogs like to snuggle under the blanket with me and make it hard for me to move at night.  I have 3 dogs and 2 of them always are under the blankets.  This is a great pad, I lay it on the foot of my bed and with the long cord, it was easy for them to sleep on it, while still being close to me!  The first night, they stayed on it most of the night.  Does not get too hot for them at all!  The only problem with it is that they love it so much, I may have to buy a few more!  The cover is very soft and nice material, easy to wipe clean and to use a roller if too furry.  Also great that it is removable so that I can wash or replace as needed!  It rolls up nice and small so when not using, can store easily.It is good size heating pad for my small and medium sized dogs.

The pad and remote are of very good quality. I wished it’d get just a bit warmer, but all 3 of my cats seems to love it nonetheless so no complaints here! I definitely recommend it for anyone with furbabies who like just lounging around like mine lol
",0.873052612,petsupplies,"It's November here in Florida and it's about 65 degree's which is pretty cold. I'm sure up North that temperature isn't, but to us, yep...Any way, my 13 year old Persian cat suffers with Spinal Arthritis and I can see her moving slower now compared to the hot months so I'm sure she's in pain because of the temperature drop. I bought her this electric heating pad and as soon as I plugged it in, she went to lay on it. I wasn't sure if she would like it as she's a window cat, but low and behold she seems to really like it, especially since it most probably helps releive the Arthritic pain.Although it came with directions, I didn't need to read them, it was simple enough. Turn it on, and adjust the temperature  (level 1 to 6) Boom, that's it. Oh and their is also an automatic switch off for 4-8-12 or 24 hours, I'm using the 12 hour one.The only thing is that their really is no thick padding, you may have to purchase that separate, there's just blue material with the heater inside. Still, she likes it as is, so were both happy.Great for all cats, especially older ones with ailments, very comforting for them, especially during Winter months.
",0.132187413,petsupplies," My dog likes the taste.  He had a easy time eating it as if it was a treat, soft enough too. He doesn't seem to be licking his paws as much after taking this.
",0.8156713213,petsupplies,"This product has probiotics as well as allergy relief.  This should keep her immune system so we have less need for the vet.  She really likes the taste.
",0.9157333413,petsupplies," My dog loves it as you can see. She eats it right away. Does not smell bad like others I have had. I would buy again and tell others to buy this product.

",0.2236022913,petsupplies,"I love that this allergy relief product has colostrum, apple cider vinegar, licorice & valerian root in addition to the salmon oil & 6 probiotic blend. And instead of a fishy flavor, which can sometimes be problematic for my picky pups, it is peanut butter that they love.
",0.0979262313,petsupplies,"Got this for my beagle who has had issues with yeast infected ears and dry itchy skin--mostly for the itchy skin, as he was constantly digging and chewing on his leg. This has made a noticeable difference. Put him on grain free food, as well, and on a probiotic. This purchase, though, seems to have been the sweet spot to stopping his itching.

",0.8771687214,petsupplies,"If you are reading this review then you probably have a cat and if that's the case then you know they can be very stubborn and what one cat loves the next cat might have zero interest in. Well that's the case for this toy. Seems to be well made, came with two sacks of catnip and a bell that you can put inside. You can also put small treats/food inside and they'll fall out a hole in the bottom as your cat plays with it. I had hoped this would give my cat something to chew on and help keep his teeth cleaner but he has no interest in it. He walked over and sniffed it and walked away. I've tried a few days in a row and looks like I'll be passing it on to someone else with a cat. I will mention that it is a rather large toy as you can see by the the photo I took with my hand beside it. I probably wouldn't get this for a small kitten, then again they may have fun wrestling it. To each their own!
",0.8259577814,petsupplies,"I didn’t have a lot of expectations for this product, especially because my cat’s favorite toys are soft. Well, immediately after I took it off from the packaging, he started smelling it. I threw it far and he just ran and attacked the toy by biting it. So funny! As I am writing this review, he has the toy with him. He really liked it, fastest than any other toy that I have bought before. And he is doing exactly what I wanted which is biting it to make his teeth better. Its also important to notice that my cat is picky about toys, and when he gets attracted to one, he will never leave it alone again. Therefore, I am predicting a long-term success for this toy! 5 stars!
",0.1170091614,petsupplies,"My cat has horrible breath, always has, and I've tried to brush her teeth but she does not cooperate.  This toy is pretty ingenious.  She didnt really go after it as much as I'd have liked with just the catnip inside, but I improvised and put some easy cheese spray in the inside instead and she went to town!  Afterwards, I just washed it out with hot water and all seems well.  Kitty has a check up in a couple months, I'm hoping for good news on her teeth!
",0.2005939214,petsupplies,"My cats came to the three packages I got for the day. They zoomed in on the one for them without me opening a thing. They dragged it away from the other packages and begin trying to break in. I opened it immediately and low and behold, it was the cat toy! It's been a hit ever since. Don't have around dogs though as they would probably destroy it in 3 seconds.
",0.0548253714,petsupplies,"Our cat seems to be enjoying this one! It came with catnip and a bell... our cat LOVED the darn thing and played with it for a while. I put in his favorite treats inside and it drove him INSANE. Cat approved!
",0.9120147214,petsupplies,"Great Gift! This year we’re doing a gift exchange between the family pets. We have a cat and he loves to chew and bite on stuff. I may end up keeping it for him but I got it for the pet exchange. It comes well packaged and is very heavy duty. It’s good for cars to bite off tarter and build up in their teeth. Great stocking stuffer.
",0.9379180114,petsupplies,"Both of my kitties really love their new catnip toy. It is larger than expected but that just means they can use it as a kicker toy too. The bell that comes with it really gets them running and they love chewing on all of the different textures. This was really well made.
",0.9526050114,petsupplies,"I wasn't too sure what to do with the bell that was included. Both of my cats played with the fish, but so far haven't chewed on it. I will hang it from something and attach the bell. They like that and will certainly attack and bite it then! It is a sturdy toy and will hold up well.
",0.9304101514,petsupplies,"Well, my cats got to enjoy this for about 3 minutes, then my 90 pound Shilo Shepard decided he wanted it and took it away from the cats.  It is his new favorite chew toy.  So it is both good for cats and dogs.
",0.9217582914,petsupplies,"My cat is kind of scared of this (think cats afraid of cucumbers videos) but my dogs love it 😂 I didn’t want it ruined so I gave it to a friends kitten who is OBSESSED! It was also much bigger than I would’ve guessed

",0.8193225915,petsupplies,"I wanted something for the holidays for the kitties. My ragdoll is used to collars and has been fine with anything whether it's leather, cloth, etc. My husband's cat is not used to anything but after 5 mins he got used to it and doesn't seem to have any problems with it at all like I've had with past collars. He doesn't itch underneath it nor shake the bell. Perfect size!
",0.1125249315,petsupplies,"Love everything about it, super cute and well made. However, the ears on the cat face buckle are very sharp and a hazard for my kitten. I ended up cutting them off and burning them down to make them safe and not sharp.
",0.2406539916,petsupplies," My cats’ favorite place just got better. At night, when there is no warm sunbeam warming their cat tower I can turn this on and make them a cozy nest. It is sized just right for the bowl of the cat tower. You can adjust the temperature and it doesn’t get overly hot so you don’t have to worry about kids bumping up the heat and overheating kitty. You can set it on timer so that it is not running all night also. One thing I like about the design is the covered electrical cord near the heating pad. As I have discovered, my cats like to play with it sometimes and I feel confident that they will not be chewing through the cord and getting zapped. It has a soft, removable cover for cleaning. It would also be a nice heating pad to use for kids because of both the size and the fact that it doesn’t get as hot as regular heating pads. You could buy it for either purpose. Great for elderly animals or cat beds in cold places like beside my window.
",0.8750271816,petsupplies,"My cats really like this. I first had it on the floor but then got the good idea to put it on their cat tree and it’s a great spot for it. I try to wait until it gets really cold before turning on the house heat, so my cats end up cuddling on this warm pet pad instead. One of my cats tries to chew up everything he can and I saw him trying to chew this up but he didn’t. The timer function gives me peace of mind that I won’t forget about it and cause a fire. The temperature control is nice too, it’s not just low-med-high, it’s actual degrees. My cats and I are quite pleased.
",0.1834979116,petsupplies,"For some reason, my mama cat is not comfortable laying on this pad while nursing her kittens, so I’ve decided to place it outside of the nursing box and she enjoys it way better. My closet is draft-free and my kittens are very warm when they huddle up together anyways. This is her first pregnancy and she is very stressed. This heating pad has helped her calm down and relax, while still alert and keeping a close distance on her babies.Worth the purchase.Easy clean up, open the cover and throw into the washing machine and dryer.Very soft and comfortable for my mama cat and kittens. (occasionally I would place it in the nursing box and outside)SUPER easy to use. The controls for the temperature is amazing. Warms up really good and quick.
",0.8728229416,petsupplies," Super easy to use. I love the programmable time setting. Warning: it is a dog bed but if you have a cat, they may displace the dog and claim.
",0.9220123316,petsupplies,"My cat was unhappy when we had to get a new television cable box that is tiny and doesn't give off heat as she loved napping atop the box (probably not safe but she did it for years).  So I ordered this heated pet pad to replace the box.  I LOVE that it has a timer and that I can control the temperature.  Mollie has learned that when I set the time and temperature it means the pad will warm up and it is time for a nap!  She is a happy cat!!
",0.2300493116,petsupplies,"My cat is rather ancient (going on 18 years) and has some arthritis in her hips.  I'd noticed her trying to get close to any source of heat in the house, and realized a heating pad might be the answer.  She never takes to anything new, but the tried and true method of sprinkling a sruface with catnip did the trick.  She now spends most of her leisure time relaxing on the pad.One cutomer complained there is a 12 hour time limit before the pad must be reset.  I find this is no problem - and prefer a heating pad that turns off automatically.

We turn it on when she’s using it and off when she’s not. It’s a good size, an approximate1’ x 1’ surface area. It’s big enough really for both dogs.

",0.1596331917,petsupplies,"I feed my dog one bully stick per day. I normally buy bully sticks at my local pet store but it's a huge pain to go to and it's crazy expensive! I finally had the genius idea to check Amazon and these were the first ones I bought.These are so much better and cheaper than what I normally get! My dog absolutely loves them. Pawstruck has got a lifelong customer. No way I'm sitting in traffic anymore to go to the store.I attached some photos so you guys can see what they look like. I bought the 8oz bag and there were 11 sticks in my bag. They varied in length and thickness. My dog liked them all the same. The thinner ones he went through faster but ultimately it doesn't matter (like the company explains over and over on this page lol) since you get more sticks if they are thinner and less if thicker. The smell wasn't too bad. Definitely had an odor since it is meat but nothing I couldn't tolerate and the dog loves it obviously. Overall, couldn't be happier and I will be recommending this brand to my dog's friends at the park. :)
",0.2226000717,petsupplies,"My first impression of this product is fantastic!  Let’s start with the packaging.  The clear window in the front and back shows me exactly what is in the bag, and I can tell right off the bat that it's a high quality product.  I can see the thickness and color of the bully sticks right there in front of me.  The logo at the top is big and colorful.  It grabs my attention right away (clever name for the company, by the way).  At the bottom of the clear window is a list of products by this company. I think it's brilliant to have those on the bottom so I know that this company provides more than just the bully sticks.  It makes me want to check out their other items.  The logo and website is at the very bottom of the package.  I like it.  On the back of the packaging is a high quality image of a dog telling the customer how great they are- this a huge ego boost to the customer!  And it also is highlighting again the quality of the product by rewarding the customer with their good choice.  I like the sweepstakes printed on the back- submitting a photo of my dog enjoying the treat can win a prize from the company.  I think that's a fantastic idea and one that many people will want to enter to win.  The contact information for the company is at the bottom as well as where you can find them on social media and the website again.  The package is also resealable, which is great for keeping the bully sticks fresh.  So as you can tell, I love this product already.  Eleven sticks came in my package. I gave a bully stick to my dog and he absolutely loved it.  I could hardly get it away from him.  It kept him sustained and quiet while I had company over and he was satisfied with it.  I think this is a great treat to give him when I want to keep him occupied.I love that this product is all natural.  Just like people-food, lots of dog foods are becoming factory-made with additives, dyes, chemicals, and they're too processed.  I love that these treats are minimally-processed and seem to be a very healthy treat for my dog.  A healthy dog is a happy dog and owner!Dental health is so important in dogs.  if their teeth are not kept healthy, gum disease and tooth decay can quickly make them sick and possibly kill them.  It takes years off a dog's life.  I think it's important to maintain dental health in dogs.  Chewing on treats such as bully sticks help prevent tooth decay, tartar buildup and plaque buildup.  I love that this treat is all-natural and healthy for my dog.This pack is not really a variety pack. It is definitely more of a value pack because of the quantity of treats in it.  The bully sticks are pretty consistent.  With a product this natural, it is difficult to make them all the same size, so I understand that there is a variance between all the bully sticks.  I am happy with the quality and quantity of sticks in this package.I would absolutely recommend this product to all my friends with dogs.  I think it’s a great all-natural treat to feed them when they need to be kept occupied, or as a calm-down treat or even a great long-lasting reward.  I think these sit well in my dog’s stomach, unlike some other types of treats.  For the price, I think this is a great value.  There are other less-healthy brands out there, but for the price, I would absolutely buy these again and again.  I am very happy with this product and I hope Pawstruck keeps pumping out quality products like this.

I gave my dog one of the full size and he was indifferent to it but chewed it up in about 15 minutes.  I will go back to Cadet, I get double sticks for the same price and takes about the same amount of time to chew it.

",0.8562836617,petsupplies,"This is a very nice package of rawhide chews for dogs. Although the price may seem a little on the expensive side, rawhide bones have gotten expensive.

I gave them each one when they first arrived and needless to say they each hit their favorite spots on the couch and I didn't hear another peep out of them until after their treats were gone.

They tend to last a long time because it takes a while for him to get through a single one (he is a little 10 lb poodle mix). The only thing I didn't like is that the products packaging was somewhat confusing.Update: The company personally contacted me and asked exactly what might be done to help make their product better after reading my review. I let them know and they said they are already in the process of making some of these updates to their products to be more customer friendly and asked if there was anything more they could do to support.
",0.7778304817,petsupplies,"My three year old loves them and it takes her several days to eat it. My 11 year old did not like them but think it is because of her age and teeth.

I would recommend these for the younger set not the old dogs if they have teeth issues.

I felt bad because he's a cool dog and he barks at times but he's good natured.I turned on this device and it made his legs move faster than my eyes could detect and either sent him back in time or teleported him five feet backwards, I couldn't tell which.  He didn't stop barking immediately, but if a dog could verbalize the words, ""what the f***!?!?"", he would've been the first.  It was an inquisitive bark with a question mark at the end from that point on until I closed the door, he cocked his head, and went trotting back into his yard.

One week of this bark deterrent device and no more barking. Miracle = I wouldn't have believed if I hadn't seen it in action. Now he let’s out a little ""gruff"" under his breath.

I’ve been using it for a few days, and it seems to be working. I was worried that she’d try to scratch at the window, but she can’t tell where it’s coming from. Easy to test the sound level.

As soon as he barks the box goes off and he stops barking right away. It doesn’t scare him, just makes him confused. I’ve had this product for a few days and he leaned on day 1 what happens when he barks. There’s a blue light that indicates when the box is on and when it goes off the button will flash red.

I only use the vibrate mode, but that has been enough of an attention getting to break the bad habit. It is so amazing,  the collar has auto retractable, will not cause irritation to your dog's neck. Also the security keypad lock prevent any misoperation on the remote. It is so important to BUILD a dog UP, instead of BREAKING them DOWN. I absolutely love how supportive and encouraging the collar is!  What a great trainer!
",0.0992293420,petsupplies," Do you want your dog to become more obedient? If so, this dog training device is really suitable for your dog. I have a keki,  and it is really naughty, I heard from my friend that he bought this dog training device and it is very useful for his dog, so I bought a whole set, which is a remote and a collar. After buying it, I found that both of them can be used, and this can control three dogs at the same time, so I bought a separate collar so that I can control with two collars. Because my friend who often has frequent business trips will put her dog in my house. I generally only use the shock function, they are also very cooperative, can know what I don't want them to do. They are no longer just biting things like they used to. I am very satisfied with this dog training device and will recommend it to other friends who have dogs.
",0.8365740220,petsupplies,"I've used many different training collars on my dogs. I mainly use the ""beep"" feature to get their attention, and very rarely, if ever use the shock.  I like that the beep on this collar is loud, and the range of the remote is pretty far.  We have a ranch and my dogs can be out in one of the fields and I can still ""beep"" them to come back.The ""beep"" button functions on the release of the button, and I am used to collars that beep on the press, so it took a little bit to get used to, but now that I know how to properly use it, it's no problem at all.The remote is a bit larger than I like, but at the same time it is really easy to see and use.  The controls are very simple and I really like that there's a lock function so I can hook the remote to my belt and not worry about accidently hitting any of the buttons .
",0.8178094620,petsupplies,"My dog used to bark at anything and everything. Now I put the collar on before opening the doggie door. She's learned. Now I don't fear her waking the whole neighborhood when she goes out to potty in the early morning. Now she goes in and out as she pleases and spends less time in her kennel. There is a shock function and a vibration function so there's an option if you don't want to shock your dog
",0.2969896220,petsupplies,"This product came very fast!  This is an updated model from the previous one I have.  There are some pros and cons to this item.Pros: smaller remote, smaller electronic part of collar, on/off button on collar to save batteryCons: You don't see a battery level icon on remote like on previous model, only controls 3 collars vs. 9 on the previous model (this is not really a con for me because I only have one dog though)Overall I'd say this collar is well worth the money.  I have only used the beep and vibrate feature because my dog responds to that so I haven't had to use the shock yet.
",0.225605420,petsupplies,"This training collar works like a charm, it fits great with my 8-month old lab, she is around 65 lb, and he is a hyperactive dog!!! She likes to jump onto people and to run out of the back yard whenever she got the chance. But, after 2 weeks in using this training collar, those bad behaviors almost gone. It's a life-changing product. Highly recommended!
",0.7631533120,petsupplies,"I got this dog collar just for the vibration function and sound since I don't want to shock my dog and it works well for that too. She responds quickly to it and the range on it is pretty good. Battery life is also good, should last few days between charges.
",0.9335941120,petsupplies,"This collar is very easy to use and my dog learned quickly what was good and what not to do. Barking was a problem but in a few days he knew to stop when I said stop.

It is a nice size for a large dog. Our dog Oscar is 15 years old and has arthritis. He immediately laid down on it and went to sleep. It has a removable fleece cover to wash. Just unzip and put it in the washer. So easy. The remote has 6 heat settings and 4 different timers.  The timer allows the user to choose from 4, 8,12, and 24 hours. It is for indoor and outdoor use. Our dog stays indoors. There is an extra long cord for your convenience. Oscar says to buy this heating pad for your pets. He loves it.
",0.8091934321,petsupplies,"It's finally getting cooler, sweater weather, but my cats love to be warm too. This is a nice pet pad. It's pretty big for a cat but that means more of them can snuggle up onto it. The fabric is soft and the cover can be removed and washed if it gets dirty. The timer is great because you can set it and walk away. You could probably use it on a person if your back was sore too. The pad gets warm but not crazy hot where you’d have to worry about burns. I’d highly recommend for people with outdoor animals in winter.

As we snuggle up with our electric lap blankets, our babe can snuggle up on his own warm spot.  We have a normal human heating pad, but this pet heating pad is durable , thicker, so I dont feel like his nails will puncture the bed.  I also feel good about the thick, protective cord covering.  The controls have a super useful timer, so I dont forget and burn down the house. All in all, I love it!

My cats aren't even trying to destroy it, which is an anomaly because they destroy every cord in the apartment if it isn't tucked away under a pillow or something.The heating pad feels like a smaller, thicker, electric blanket and I love it. My cats love chilling out on it, and when they're not using it I myself like to lay on top of it when I go to sleep lol. It's super comfy and I love all the settings you can choose! It comes with the outside pillow case thing already on it, so there's no setup other than plugging it in and picking your settings. Absolutely love this.
",0.8509850521,petsupplies,"This is a nice heating pad. The color is nice and the fabric is pretty soft. My babies like it, and I am sure they will love it much more when it gets colder, which is super soon! It’s good for small dogs up to medium-sized dogs. It’s easy to plug in and turn on. There are different heating settings to choose from. At the highest, it still felt fine. I tried it before my babies did, of course. I would definitely recommend this product to get some additional warmth to your babies.

When I seen this I thought WHAT A GREAT IDEA! As lucky as it may seem, Finland’s heating pad arrived 2 days before our first 35 degree night .. I am so happy with this product for it is big enough and wide enough for him to travel around his cage doing his typical hedgehog behaviors without him getting cold! The fleece covers are so soft too!! Now Finland doesn’t chew on stuff however the chew proof cord is definitely a bonus! I love the temp control.. very easy to use!

They also have arthritis and keeping them warm helps ease their pain. In the few days i have had this has made a couple of senior dogs very happy. The cord is very durable and strong. The temperature control makes it easy to keep from hurting my dogs and being too hot. The top is easy to wipe clean and their hair comes off with just a shake outside. The heating pad is nice to look at too. My 17 year old cat loves it too!
",0.9079010521,petsupplies,"As the weather is getting colder, I could tell my dog does not want to get out of bed and she loves to sun bathe in the afternoon. With this in mind, I knew I had to get her a heating pad as she doesn't have much fur and she's very tiny. Now that I have set this up for her, she loves it! Instead of using the cover it came with though, I opted for a pet blanket and I will eventually sew it all together so that it can fit the heating pad inside of it. Overall, great product and I love how there's a timer on it so that I know my dog will be safe.

I like these for puppies that need extra heat so much safer to use then a heat bulb and this is Adjustable so the heat can be on a low setting,the cover is washable and  the  soft heater looks like it can be wiped clean and the cord is chew proof  so lots of reasons I said yes to this one and I will be using it for whelping puppies when my girl has puppies later on as well as I do not like heat bulbs and this should keep the babies warm as it seems to be keeping my puppy  warm on a cold day on the lowest setting even though she is inside its a little cold on chilly nights .
",0.8910238122,petsupplies,"A little about my dog: She's a lab/german shepard mix and now nine years old. About a year ago I noticed her start to limp on her front legs. We usually walk 2-5 miles per day, with 30-60 minutes additional play time at the dog park. She's a very social girl and loves to be by my side day and night. Roughly six months ago I had to cut her walking down to a half a mile per day. Her arthritis reached a point where it was causing her so much pain that she could barely walk.Like other reviewers, I took Taro to the vet to have her legs checked out. Arthritis was the diagnosis and pain meds/anti inflammatories were the treatment. I'm not worried about the cost of the meds as I would spend whatever it takes to keep my dog healthy. However I hate putting my dog on prescription meds as the side effects can take a toll on her organs over the long haul. After doing quite a bit of research, I settled on trying Doggie Dailies for her arthritis. There are over 1000 RAVE reviews about Doggie Dailies, but I was skeptical it could work on a dog in so much pain. I had to give it a fair try before sticking my dog on prescription meds for the rest of her life.After a full month of being on Doggie Dailies, Taro is back to being her active and happy lifestyle. No it didn't turn her back into a puppy, but she's running again and we are back to our five mile walks. If you get this supplement, you have to make sure you give the proper dosage every single day. And you have to do it for several weeks before you will notice any difference.Of course all dogs are different and may not respond the same, but Taro certainly is back to normal. She doesn't limp anymore and she's staying ahead of me on our walks. It works and it works well.Thank you to the creators of Doggie Dailies. You have brought back Taro's quality of life.
",0.1238034122,petsupplies,"Our 15 year old dog had gotten to the point where he had great difficulty standing up and I actually made an appointment with the vet to put him to sleep. This was about a week after taking him to the vet to see if there was anything we could do to help him. At that visit, the vet diagnosed painful arthritis in his back legs and we were given a prescription for a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, which seemed to help marginally. On the sad day I was to take him in to be put to sleep, he seemed to rally a bit, so we postponed things. Since starting him on Doggie Dailies a few days after that, our once miserable dog has slowly improved. I'm not sure whether it is the medicine or the Doggie Dailies, I suspect that it is a combination of the two, but whatever it is, he is dramatically improved and readily doing things that were impossible for him previously. This includes the ability to go in and out of the house through the dog door. He is not back to bouncing around like a 2 year old, but he is happy, not in pain and has a slight bounce back in his step. We are really grateful!
",0.1253154922,petsupplies,"Before I broke my hip last summer, I walked Stacey Lynn, my 8 year old German Shepherd, between 10 and 13 miles everyday.  When I was recovering back at home, mostly immobile in bed, Stacey Lynn didn't EVER want to leave my side so when folks came by the house to exercise her, she would not go and after 6 months of being immobile with me, arthritis set her right hip.  Vet was sure she would get stamina back in time but she was so pained by her arthritis we couldn't even walk around the block. Medicines helped but they have there own down side.My cousin recommended this supplement, raving about how her dogs have responded.  I wasn't expecting her result because her dogs are much younger but I wanted to try it for any relief it would give my dog.  Today, on her third day taking this supplement, we leisurely walked almost 45 mins and even Stacey Lynn does not have the muscle tone she had, but she was NOT in pain and wasn't limping like she limped just last week after walking only 15 minutes.  The pain makes her limp horribly so but her limp today was for the same as mine: out of shape!  Stacey Lynn has been so happy and playful since our walk that I know her pain level has lessened so much.  I am thrilled to be able to slowly help get her stamina and muscle tone back because stamina and muscle tone helps keep arthritis in check.  Your supplement is making her rehabilitation possible
",0.0345743322,petsupplies,"When we received our first order of Doggie Dailies I will admit we were far from impressed. They had formed into a clump in the bottle and we ended returning them. A few weeks after we returned them I received an email from Alex Brown, with the Doggie Dailies company. He expressed how unacceptable the quality of the product we had received was and how sorry he was for that. He also went on to explain what had happened during the shipping process that had caused the clumping and how rare it was for that to happen. He then asked if we would allow him to send us another bottle and give their product a second chance and we said of course! I was blown away by the email I received and so impressed with their customer service. There are very few companies that would take time out of their day to do that. We received our new bottle and it was in perfect condition. Our dog seems to like the taste of these much better than the previous supplement we were using. Looks like we are now hooked on the Doggie Dailies brand!

The vet said it was arthritis. They gave an NSAID for dogs and she was running around the house a few hours later. But at $3 a pill I needed to find an alternative medicine to help her joints and pain.I researched several products.Most of them are beef based. She has a beef allergy so I couldn't use them.Most of them are pill form, which she will only take if I cram them down her throat. Not pleasant.The doggie dailies are perfect and she loves them. They have several ingredients in them that are supposed to help with her joints. More ingredients than other brands that I looked in to.Because of her size she has to take several a day, but the jar is quite a large quantity.And she absolutely loves them.  All I have to do is pick up the jar and she gets excited for her ""treats"".I also have a pain tab that I've added to her regimen that has willow bark and pineapple seed extract in it. Of course it's a pill form, but she gets her doggies dailies as a reward for being a good dog after she takes them.I have some of the expensive NSAIDs on hand, but I haven't had to give her any since she's been taking her supplements.She's back to her old self again and getting around much better than she had been.

She’s started showing some signs of old age, so thought I’d try giving her some glucosamine to see if it helped any. I made the big mistake of buying this product. Received these today, and gave her one as soon as they arrived. Like several of the other 1-star reviews (which I now wish I would have read) she got sick. I was awoken in the middle of the night by her getting out of the bed and then having diarrhea all over the bedroom. This supplement was the only thing different she had to eat, so it had to be from this. She had been her normal self earlier in the day, and in the days leading up to today. I also highly question whether or not these are really made in the USA. The ONLY place it says these are made in the USA is here on Amazon. There is ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE on the package where it says these are made in the USA. There are also typos on the package that would commonly be seen in Chinese translation to English that I’ve never seen on labeling of a USA made product. I’m going to see if Amazon will refund my money, even though it’s been opened/used, and then look for a glucosamine supplement from a more well known company.
",0.522,petsupplies,"What in the world?! I bought Doggie Dailies for our 12 year old Labrador Retriever, who spent most of her time sleeping and had trouble walking without obvious pain.  I gave her 3 last night, and this morning, she came running over to me.  If that wasn't a big enough surprise, I just got a phone call that she had been found in the next neighborhood over from ours. (I had given her a second dose with her morning meal.) I went and picked her up and put her in the garage while I investigated her escape route.  Check out these pictures.  She has always been afraid of thunderstorms, and we had a brief one roll through a while ago.  Instead of going inside her dog house like she has done for years, she straight up ate the bottom of the fence, broke the board in half and went walkabout.  Haha!  In a nutshell, she went from a half blind, half deaf old dog that slept all day on Saturday to freaking Mighty Dog today.

The part that picks up the poop has teeth on one side, and mostly flat on the other side. This makes it really easy to grab the package.  The handle is really easy to squeeze. I was able to pick up the yard in just a few minutes. Definitely better than using gloves, and ultimately less wasteful.

Once the digital display says 4, it's fully charged and will last up to 30 days depending on how barky your dogs are. You'll see the power level decrease over time to know when to charge it again.I was a skeptic on if this would work because others in the past have not picked up on my grandparent's dogs barking. They have very high pitched barks which I think can be missed by other boxes.We tried this out yesterday and it shut them right up! I had the sensitivity set to 4 and the intensity set to 3. They started barking, it went off, and they stopped instantly! I was shocked.One thing is that single beep means it's on. Two beeps means you turned it off. It sits idle without a light in between use so don't worry about it being off! It's doing that to conserve battery.

It is waterproof which is a plus so it can be used both indoors and outdoors and it only took a few hours to charge up for a month or so worth of charge. I love that this is a safe way to stop barking, she was considering getting a shock collar because the barking is so bad but we are trying this first. I am happy to report although it doesn't detur barking that is out of range, she has reported a difference in the amount of barking happening while her dogs are outback and in range, even the chihuahuas are barking less. No calls to the police since we got it about the barking happening at her house. I'm hoping this is a long term solution and will update this when I know more.

We received this Leketi Dog Barking Control device and within seconds put 9v battery and hocked it halfway on our back yard, turned it to setting 2. A person with their little dog walks by and we are watching to see what our girls will do, she barked at them twice and at second bark she stops halfway into the bark. Time goes by and she keeps being on guard but not a peep, not a bark for hours.

Finally this item worked. Can’t thank Leketi enough for such a fantastic item.
",0.1937107125,petsupplies,"I had gotten my dog an anti-barking collar which worked really well but my mom didn’t want her dog to have to wear one. We tried this, thinking there is no way this would be effective. We were wrong. Literally, overnight it stopped her dog from barking at all. You charge it inside using the cord that is included (you need to provide your own cube) and then set it outside. We even tried keeping it in the house and the dog still didn’t bark all day. This thing is a lifesaver!
",0.1395470225,petsupplies,"Between our two dogs and the neighbor on 2 sides' dogs there was little peace to be had. We thought we would give these a shot. One was defective and had to return it but the other worked so well that the dogs don't even want to go near the fence to bark at eachother*. The description is a bit inaccurate. It is audible to the human ear it's kind of like a squeel/whistle that is not that loud which is how we knew one wasn't working.
",0.0381084425,petsupplies,"I have 3 Dachshunds who love to bark at anything, or nothing.  The house next door is under construction, so I had to stop their continuous bark when they're in the back yard.  I have owned bark devices like this in the past, and they helped.  But they all were dead.  I like with this one that it's rechargable, has different sensitivity, and frequency levels.  After I received it, I charged it overnight, and then put it outside.  It works great, I already notice a difference.  Over time the dogs will learn not to bark, and then will not bark even without this device.

The size is perfect compared to some lick-mats I've bought for my dog (who is a 75 lb golden retriever/yellow lab mix) and it allows me to put a little more food (wet and dry) than the traditional silicone style lick mats.

There are many dog treats on the market that should be removed from the shelves due to unhealthy and dangerous ingredients. I have tried discussing this with the managers of Walgreens stores, only to be told that the distributor has to agree to it. Well that's like letting the fox guard the chicken coop. Most of the unhealthy products come from China and so won't be removed. It's unfortunate that pet owners don't read the ingredients and source of the products. If they did, these poisonous treats would never stay on the shelves. Thank you to a Celebrity pet owner who is responsible about what dogs get, and works to keep her ingredients pure.

I've trimmed around all the pads on my dogs feet (easily because the edges are so sharp), I trimmed the hair around my husband's ears, and I used the thinning shears on 15 year old daughters hair to take some of the weight off, and I trimmed 20 year old daughter's bangs. This set can be used for so manyy types of dog's hair maintenance, human hair maintenance, and facial upkeep.

",0.8369060834,petsupplies,"We have had our Automatic Modus Anti Barking device for about a week now.  We ordered it (after having so much success with the handheld device) so that we could have a way to discourage our sweet but protective dog from barking so much when someone comes to the door. She would often bark long and loud even at family who live here. Her particular breed is known for barking and her bark is extremely loud and often quite sharp. So our main goal for her is to curtail the amount of barking as much as possible and perhaps eliminating it except in the case of strangers. For several days after we received it there was no opportunity to see how it works. Eventually we did have neighbors come over whom she is somewhat familiar with and the barking began in full force, however it was of a much shorter duration and she responded much more quickly to our vocal commands. Since then the barking has been noticeably less to not at all.  We have the device set at Low which has seemed to be effective enough but it's nice to know that if needed we could increase the ultrasonic sound level.The device is attractive but much larger than I expected.  I just never bothered to check the specs for the size and went by the pictures. It's 6 1/2"" H x 4"" Wx 2 1/4"" D. I would definitely recommend this device for anyone who has a dog that barks too much.
",0.8330097234,petsupplies,"My dog barks at anyone who walks by my front door so I bought this to train her. I set device by front door and the second my dog barks it activates, she stops barking and runs into other room. I’m slowly working with her and only turn device on when I know mail carrier or neighbor walks by. So far it is working well.  I have a small apartment so loud noises from tv will activate it so with that being said I only turn device on when I’m working with dog. I have the small handheld device which has been amazing with deterring my dog from being possessive over food bowl. Great training products.
",0.1109937434,petsupplies,"Worked within the first 10 seconds of turning it on! We have 2 dogs - 1 older lab mix  and one young medium Shepard mix...our neighbors have 1 medium lab mix and 1 large boxer. They make our neighborhood think we are running a dog fighting ring with the sounds they make when we let ours out into our fenced backyard and they do the same into their backyard where we share a length of chain length fence. The noise is scary and deafening and will stop and start over and over until one of us calls the dogs back in. We just let them all out simultaneously and they all raced for the fence to yell at each other and it lasted 2 seconds before my female Shepard mix flattened her ears, looked around wildly, and tore back into the house! My old man lab looked around confused but quiet and meandered back in. It has been stone silent since!!!
",0.534,petsupplies,"We bought one of these in June 2019 because all of the doors opening & closing was causing our dog to bark.  Wanting to avoid a noise complaint we bought this device, and it immediately fixed the problem!  Now our dog either doesn't bark, or barks softly as to not set off the device.  Only now have we had to replace the battery on after leaving it on continuously for 4 months.  We're moving to a two-story house and decided to buy another one to keep him from barking at the front or back door!

This one I wanted to wait about a week to write the review. My labs can only get out one bark each. I can tell it stops them instead of them trying to continually bark. As we get a lot of different people that come to farm. Its so much more peaceful and no need to make sure someone has the button.

Nearly eliminated the barking entirely. Next day, not so much. I increased the setting. The product definitely does something because the pups barking remains deceased. I imagine using the product with one dog is preferable because you can judge effectiveness more easily. As it’s only been a few days, I may revise my rating.

Plus, lighting makes it possible, so I never go out again because my lighting is bad, so my makeup is too dark or too bright.It also looks cute. It's a plus sign. As others have pointed out, it does get very warm. Do not touch it uncomfortably, but I will not keep it when you are not in the room. I just turn it on for makeup or eyebrow plucking and close it immediately after finishing, so I don't have any problems.Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with this product.

We forgot to pick it up one morning and my husband found our Bichon  sleeping on it - I guess dreaming about the next meal! The 10 Year warranty is a good indication of the quality. We DO recommend-more importantly, our dog recommends!

The last one I had was made to reduce litter tracking from the litter box, but one of my cats decided it was a cat toy instead and tore it apart!  This works great!  The size is right, no water will leak through when some gets spilled, and it is super easy to keep clean!  It also looks very stylish.  I liked it so much, I just purchased another one to put one of the dog's food bowls on.  It is avery solid product - you won't be disappointed.

It appears to be well made and I like the fact that it can go into the dishwasher if need be.  Some animals make a mess of they're feeding areas so I feel like I am prepared for anything by getting this Silicone mat for the new kitty.  It has a small lip around the perimeter to keep liquids inside the mat.  I think this will be adequate for our needs to keep our new kitty healthy and it's feeding area clean.  Very good quality!

Seems well made with decent quality control. clean smooth threads (a good indicator of quality and or quality control) the ""warp core"" (battery holder) inside is nice and stout and again appears well made (can be a weak spot on poorly made units)The emitters are decently strong. cover then with your hand and you can feel the UV heat (literally sunburn :-)DO be careful around children. Don't leave them unattended with it. they can be attracted to the ""pretty purple light"" and this might be powerful enough to damage eyes.uv reactive stuff really flares up nicely (See pictures) should not have a problem finding stains with this or maybe some critter hunting in the desert (some scorpions are UV reactive)Overall I am pleased with the quality and function. its a decent buy and good value.
",0.9592615438,petsupplies,"This blacklight flashlight has a  good wide beam with a good stream of blacklight.  I own a smaller pair of Gearlight blacklight flashlights, and have been duly impressed with the quality of their construction and their ease of use, and portability.  I use the smaller ones to check my paper money, and wanted a larger one for use during my picking of vintage and antique goods.  I also wanted the large beam version for use when I'm traveling, and want to check out my overnight hotel accomodations--I realized it would be easier to use when doing a visual sweep of a room.  Gearlight's customer service is beyond reproach--my first large beam flashlight had a disconnect with its LED panel, and when I reached out to Gearlight, they replaced it toot-suite--no questions asked.  I appreciate that when I choose to purchase from a specific company, they actually treasure my patronage-and I intend to refer to Gearlight for my future flashlight needs, be it standard or blacklight LED.  I would appreciate a combo style flashlight,featuring the ability  to alternate between regular LED illumination & blacklight LED illumination but also I realize that simplicity is key, and sometimes the doubling up of functions only serves to complicate use of a product.  I'm glad to have Gearlight's flashlights in my stead, for personal and business use, as well as home & travel usage.
",0.9231043538,petsupplies,"Everyone should buy one of these.  You're not going to believe what you can see with this.  I live in Arizona so I purchased mainly for finding scorpions when we stay in the backyard, well, this thing can find all kind of stuff, dust and dirt and will detect pet stain, urine and other stuff.  Take it with you when you travel and just discover all the crud and (who knows what else), you might be able to get a free room if you call the manager and show it to him.  Don't forget to bring disinfectant Lysol wipes.  I'm having so much fun with this, inspecting the entire house right now. :)
",0.77793738,petsupplies,"Perfect for finding the pet spot you thought you saw or the one you stepped in at night and need to find. I like this before I clean my carpet, I use this light when the other lights are off. I hold it directly above the carpet 1-2 feet and can see discoloration where my dogs have peed. Then I can use a spray to get the stain out.
",0.8341584238,petsupplies,"This flashlight casing is very high quality, with excellent light output.  There’s a small statement on the box that says it doesn’t work for cat urine, but that’s what I bought it for and I’ve been able to find the places the cat has used.
",0.2122605438,petsupplies,"We have dogs and the previous homeowners had dogs as well. As scared as I was to know, I just had to find out how bad the carpets were. We decided on this light given its positive feedback and price. I was expecting to get a lightweight plastic product. When I pulled it out of the box, I was amazed. It's made of metal and felt the same quality as the big lights police carry around. Seriously, its very good quality.  The light takes 6 batteries and was very bright. I honestly don't think you'll find a better black light, especially for the price. Needless to say, our carpets will be cleaned asap.
",0.1490562338,petsupplies,"I have 2 dogs that from time to time will pee in the house. I have mopped and mopped and could not get rid of the pee smell so I got this light and I was horrified to see places they had peed that I had no idea and couldn’t tell so hadn’t mopped. I wish it didn’t take quite so many batteries or maybe if it was rechargeable but other than that it is a really great product. Make sure you are ready to be disgusted!

The toy came with small catnip packages, but I don’t think they had a strong enough scent. I rubbed the toy in catnip and that’s when the cats went crazy for it.
",0.1690700739,petsupplies,"This toy is much larger and heavier than I had expected. I took it out of the box thinking it was too heavy for any of my 3 cats to want to touch. I tossed it on the floor and 2/3 cats came running over. They pawed it back and forth for awhile until one decided to take it over. He actually layed and chewed on it for awhile. It smells really good, a bit minty. Only the one cat has payed it any attention since the first day. My petite cat it's to large and heavy for. I do expect 1-2 cats to continue using it.
",0.0689779839,petsupplies," Kitty loves this! She is definitely a chewer and love catnip. I couldnt figure out how to attach the included bell, so I just shoved it on one of the legs, and my cat loved it. She is highly responsive to bells... she had a similar toy and chewed off the tail and nose. This one is bigger and sturdier so I'm hopeful itll last longer. She chews on it when I hold it for her, mostly, so I need to figure out how to set it up in a similar fashion for her easy chewing.
",0.9196885839,petsupplies," It's much larger than I expected--the material it's made from is heavyweight and nice and grippy, allowing for it to double as a fur brush or a tooth cleaning toy. The cat we least expected to be interested in it has made it hers (fl00fy boi enjoyed the little legs as a fur brush but our void girl fell in love immediately). That's actually a good thing, as she won't let us look in her mouth. The extra catnip pouch and bell are nice additions.
",0.7607849839,petsupplies,"This is a smart product to entice cats with cat nip while engaging in play, as well as dental hygiene. I added some of my own, loose catnip inside the toy to draw my cat's attention more. There are 3 catnip pouches that come with the toy (2 are already stuffed inside, and 1 extra). The toy is a durable material that should withstand my cat chewing on...it's not super soft or squishy where my cat would puncture it or tear it up. Good size, not too big or too small.
",0.2182281939,petsupplies,"I'm so excited to give this to my cats for Christmas. I have one cat in particular that's going to freak out. She likes rubber/silicone toys that feel like a dead animal body. Lol Her previous owners let her outside but she killed wild animals so we keep her inside. She's going to love to have another ""dead body"" to carry around and it'll be helping her teeth at the same time!
",0.2411934439,petsupplies," Cute designed for  kittens.  The concept  is great.  My cat was very interested  in the cat nip pouch . And kept pulling it out. My cat is 8 and not really  much into toys so I tried it with my sister's  kitten and she went berserk  over it. And used it for what it was ment for. I give it 4 outa of 5 only because  it didn't  appeal to or make my older cat  didn't  enjoy it much but it did appeal to a younger cat
",0.7711277639,petsupplies,"My cat is a spoiled brat, and I'm always trying to find new toys to challenge her and keep her entertained. This alligator was our latest adventure and boy did she love it. She has guarded this thing like a prized mouse since I got it out of the box. I am happy with it because she seems to be overly impressed. It seems well made and it is fun to look at!
",0.8076443739,petsupplies,"We added the included bell and one of the included packets of catnip to the inside of the toy and laid it by our cat. She has been enjoying rubbing her face on it since then, pretty much. lol She recently had a tooth removed, so she isn't into chewing on stuff yet, but hoping she does use it like this as well to help keep her teeth cleaner.
",0.8400893239,petsupplies,"I like to give my cat some treats in the evening, after dinner and this will hold a good amount. I had a ball but it was too easy for him to get them out. This takes a little longer, but he got them all out the first time that I filled it. he doesn't bite it though. Just bats it around. Which is OK because he needs the exercise.
",0.929974240,petsupplies,"I love this because my dog loves this! I work long hours, and while I have dog walkers come play with my dog halfway through my work day, she is still at home alone too much, and I typically give her a stuffed, frozen Kong toy or the dog walkers do, or both. This Lickimat Wobble lets me just coat the inside with yogurt, say, freeze it, and today I embedded a few pieces of kibble before the yogurt was frozen solid. My dog was so excited when I gave it to her this morning that she barely noticed I was leaving for work. Because it's a bowl, I can easily coat the inside with something edible without having to stuff the whole thing, so I'm not overfeeding her treats. I'll try peanut butter, too. Yogurt is really perfect for this as it's thick enough that it can freeze in place without pooling at the bottom. What an ingenious idea. I may have to get another! It would also work as feed bowl for meals.
",0.2322533740,petsupplies,"I am a huge fan of the original lickimats, and these just offer a bonus challenge for your dog. It freezes just as well as the mats do and lasted a bit longer thanks to the challenging shape. Spreading stuff inside is a bit more annoying than on the flat surface, but it doesn't detract from the overall review!!
",0.540,petsupplies,"Love this product for slowing my dog down while he eats. It now takes him a couple of minutes to eat his food, rather than 30 seconds! My only complaint is that it does not come in a smaller size for smaller dogs. My papillon only gets 2 tsp of food twice a day, and when spread out in this bowl, it looks like its not a lot of food! My dog doesnt seem to mind, but I do wish they had a smaller one. You can flip it inside out to make cleaning easier. I usually let it soak and then take a bristle brush to it to get the few remaining crumbs out.
",0.0909086840,petsupplies,"I flip it inside out, smear some peanut butter on, flip it right side out, and it keeps my pup busy for at least 20 minutes. Have used it to distract her from scary noises! She hasn't damaged it at all either. Would definitely recommend

We had high hopes for this product and were disappointed that it didn’t last more than 1 time without being destroyed. NOT an item for dogs who are chewers!

That was an ordeal since it has a cord, and I had to make sure that I could be near an outlet to do the dogs nails. The dog hated the high pitch noise of the dremmel, and that made her all the more difficult to trim her nails. This nail trimmer is a dream! I love that it is rechargeable and cordless, so I can use it anywhere in the house. It has several sizes depending on how large the nails are, but it also has shielding for nails that are at an angle that are difficult to trim. My dog didn't freak out about the sound (she doesn't love it, but she doesn't run from it either), and it makes the process better for both of us. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an easier way to trim their dogs nails at home.

To turn on you twist the grey ring and turning it more will increase the speed (variable). Not sure if the grinder wheel can be replaced but it seems that it should last quite some time before wearing out.

Once it arrived I washed it and dried it so this is it after a wash! It’s soooo fluffy and soft! It has grip on the bottom so it helps with it not sliding around.
",0.9066075744,petsupplies," Love it! I failed to measure the diameter but loved the look of this as my dog loves to snuggle into her current deflated and old bed. This one is awesome! Bigger than I expected but I’m glad! No harsh smells or odors and incredibly soft!
",0.9639589844,petsupplies,"As soon as I unboxed the bed and set it down my two smaller dogs were fighting over it. As you can see they compromised for a while and then took turns napping in it.  It is super soft and squishy. I love that it's one piece so you don't have to worry about the cushion falling out all the time like some other ""donut"" types. I am probably going to buy the next size up when I order another one.
",0.2454784244,petsupplies,"My miniature dachshund just loves this bed. Soon as I took it out of the box she didnt even give me time to fluff it and set it out for her. She jumped right in it and start being silly then laid down in it. So for my pup, it was love at first sight.  This bed is so soft in many ways. My pup always looks so comfortable in it. Heck I want one for me. LolI bought the small size and it's just right.
",0.867209244,petsupplies,"Wow! I wasn’t really expecting this to be much better than any ol’ regular animal bed... but it’s actually really great! It’s incredibly soft and plush. I bought it for our outdoor farm cat.It’s now very cold out and I needed a warm place for her to sleep. This is so cozy and she snuggles right up! (We added a small pet bed warmer to it) and now she comes home every night and curls up in it. Absolutely loves it. She comes out purring every morning and she’s nice and warm. I haven’t washed it yet, but if anything happens, I’ll update. Again, i use it outside, but it’s actually in our garage. It would be perfectly suitable for indoors. I think out in the elements it would blend to be inside a dog house, to keep it dry, but the bottom has a different kind of slick material that I bet would help keep it dry.
",0.9265376944,petsupplies,"When my dog gets something delivered for him, you better believe my dog is going to open up his own packages.  He was ECSTATIC when he opened this bed out of its packaging.  He treated it like a stuffef animal at first, until he realized he can jump right into it and lay down.  This bed is super soft and the long fibers give the bed a wavy and fun appearance. The bed fits right in with my decor, and overall my dog absolutely loves burying his face and body into it. The cat not so much haha.I have tried many beds before, from flat, to couch, memory foam, etc etc etc none are as appealing and comfortable as this one ism if my dog wasnt using it, i woulf stuff it with more cotton and use it as a bean bag chair, believe me!
",0.7646379544,petsupplies,"I had assumed that there was no way this dog bed could be as plush as it looked in the photos, but I was definitely mistaken! I got the Medium size bed for my small dogs (~10lbs) and they love it! It is extremely soft to the touch and so plush that the bed itself is probably 6 inches off of the ground. If they snuggle closely, both can fit on it at once, but it is more aptly sized for one dog. They lay in the middle and prop their heads up on the donut border and look comfier than I have probably ever been in my life. Great purchase that is spoiling my dogs!
",0.1465573644,petsupplies,"Bummed out that when I received this dog bed, it already had two holes in it. It’s not visible but my dogs might dig at it so I’ll be sewing it. Other than that, it is really soft and comfortable for my dogs. It’s better than the floor, that’s for sure. It looks really nice as well.
",0.8422844445,petsupplies,"The picture attached is the evil little $1,600 piece of cheese that wrecked our lives. My dogs love these treats but BEWARE! I usually take  the treats away from them when they get small but this time our Beagle mix just swallowed a hunk of the cheese. It happened in seconds! He seemed totally fine so the Vet said he would probably just pass it. A few days later he started vomiting and rubbing his belly on the carpet. We took him to the emergency vets and found the cheese was lodged where his stomach meets his intestine. They had to do an emergency endoscope and luckily were able to remove the piece. If they couldn’t pull it out with the scope, then they would have to do emergency surgery.  This nasty little nugget caused all sorts of ulcers and damage going down so now our dog is on a chicken and rice diet for a week and multiple expensive stomach coating antacid medicines. The whole thing was awful and set us back $,1600 so far... he will still need follow up appointments and scopes to make sure he is healed. So I say, be nice to your dogs and stay away.
",0.0342518145,petsupplies,"I had no idea what to make of these when my wife ordered them. My dogs weren't entirely sure what to make of them either when we gave one to each. At first, they treated them like most every other treat we gave them. Gnawed on them for about 20 minutes and then left them alone. We had been hoping for longer play, but after 20 minutes of nonstop gnawing, neither of my dogs had made a real dent. We took them away for the night and brought them out the next night. That's when it started.After a night away, both dogs figured out what they needed to do to get something out of this nearly rock hard block of treat. Both need to hold it firmly and just keep scraping away. Both used them for almost an hour before I took them away because I was done listening to both dogs go at each one almost nonstop. Each block was still mostly the same length with a slight thinner edge where most of the chewing and gnawing had been going on.Each has probably had one block for 7 or more hours now and it's about half gone. They know exactly what it is when I bring the bag out now and both head to their separate corners to go to town on their treat. My Bernese has figured out how to snap small bits off the now small piece and takes those down with ease. I figure each remaining piece has about 2, maybe 3 more hours of play left before they are gone. So, we're getting somewhere in the 8-10 hour range of play per treat, per dog. That beats out the bones they chew clean in a hour and keeps them occupied for a lot longer than any toy or treat dispensing toy I've used.Definitely something we want to get again.
",0.545,petsupplies," I love my dogs but raising a German Shepard mix is not easy. I play with her, walk her, but she has a motor that won't quit. Sometimes I just need a break! I have tried all sorts of chews and after she passed about 3 months old, there is no enzymatic chew, greenie, or even a bully stick that can survive the jaws of this puppy for more than 10 minutes.These Yak things are amazing!! Better than an elk's horn. My video says it all but make sure you know this: That's after over 30 minutes of working on it in the house. She took it outside to get a drink. She dropped it in the water and that's where the video starts.She finally gave up on it after about an hour. AN HOUR!So, if you want an alternative to stuffing a kong, these might work.HOWEVER, two caveats:1) My other dog, a pit mix, was able to widdle one down to about a 3-inch long piece in about 30 minutes. I took it away for fear of her swallowing it. You will need to watch your dog and see how it goes.2) The puppy dropped another one I gave her and it broke into two pieces. I don't think this is going to happen every time but it can so, as always, check on your dog. Personally, I would not leave my dog unattended with one of these.
",0.092914745,petsupplies,"As advertised, fresh, NO mold, no odor.  Our Golden Retriever Abby has food and environmental allergies.  We only feed her limited ingredients dog food.  Ditto treats, only Natural Bounty limited ingredients.  She can't have rawhide or other hard chews, only deer antler.  I was worried that these Gold Yak dog chews would give her an outbreak, but since the cheese comes from overseas, and it is grain free, we took a chance on them.  Abby sniffed one and in no time set to chewing it up.  She has powerful jaws, and it only took her about an hour to devour one of the three chews.  That did not surprise me.Been five days since today, and no change in her skin or behavior.  We are pleased.  She can break the stick into large chunks, but she just chews them up too. I wouldn't give them to her unsupervised.  Keeping her occupied for an hour while I read or watch TV is great.  No digestive troubles either, no gas, diarrhea, constipation.She will get one every week or two now.  And I will put them on subscribe and save now.  We heard of the EcoKind Pet Treats via Whole Dog Journal recommendation.  I read all  the reviews, even the competitors reviews.  It seems mold was a problem early on, but the distributor fixed that problem  with how to store and ship.  In the end I went with EcoKind and we are very pleased.  Would recommend these chews to other dog owners.Thank you EcoKind.  Our Abby has been starved for a good chew for 6 years now.  Between the deer antlers and these softer chews she isn't so deprived.  She loves to chew, but has never damaged any of our stuff.  She has the Nylabone type hard chews, but gets bored with them pretty quick.All's well that ends well.

",0.8442983645,petsupplies,"Packaging was in rough shape when received, though it looked to be sealed still.  Like many other reviews experienced, the weight was not as advertised (~13.8oz).  Two of the chews looked fine, and my dog happily chewed those down to nubs so the taste must be good.  There was what seemed to be mold on another one, but it was easy enough to scrape off.  However, the last chew I pulled out appears to have metal shavings embedded in it.  At first I thought it may be aluminum foil stuck to it from the production process, so I tried scraping it off.  I wish I had taken a photo before then, as it was more apparent how large the pieces were.  They were bendable, but stiffer than aluminum foil; enough to poke a fingertip rubbed over them.  After scraping, you can see what's left of the pieces are actually in the chew. I don't know how deep they go.  While it's possible this is an isolated incident, I cannot in good conscience give these to my dog any longer, as there's no way for me to know if the next one has metal shavings deeper inside that I can't see.
",0.0664461645,petsupplies,"As I'm writing this review, I am sitting in my vet's office waiting on my dog to come back from the back where they have taken him for pre-op bloodwork...because he fractured two of his molars chewing on these ""treats"". That's right - 2 slab fractures on 2 molars. For reference, my dog is a healthy lab mix. I'll be out roughly $1,500 due to these things. I first noticed that there may be something wrong when I saw a tinge of blood on one of these chews last night. I thought to examine my dog's mouth and that is when I noticed the two fractured teeth and brought him to the vet for the first available appointment this morning. I am beyond angry. FYI - the veterinary community advises against these due to their hardness and tendency to break teeth. As a responsible dog owner, I thought to share this as I would hate for anyone else to go through what I'm going through - both financially and in terms of the crappiness of having to put a totally healthy dog under general anesthesia to have teeth extracted due to these horrible chews. What is most concerning to me is that so many dogs may break teeth on these without their owners even noticing. Dogs sometimes don't show symptoms of dental pain until an infection has spread. If your dog has chewed on these, please take the time to examine his/her mouth.
",0.0755815245,petsupplies,"I trusted that the company's assertion that they'd corrected the problem with mold were true.  They're not true.  These came in pierced packaging.  There was a strong musty odor to them before I opened the package fully.  And there was mold on two of the four pieces.  Amazon made good on it for me, and I would have left it at that after cleaning them off.  However, they are not as long-lasting as other yaks' milk chews I've given my dogs in the past.  One was eaten in its entirety by my 20-pound dog.  The thing was easily five inches long.  He's a chewer, yes, but he's never gone through anything that's meant to last like that before.  The others were chewed down to nubs.  I will not buy these again.  Other brands do the job better.

The 3 year old border collie (40lb) would have it down in less than 3, but she is a relentless chewer that destroys everything in her path. They can leave small slivers are on the floor, but do not stain anything and are not messy. The chews are quite hard, so at first were worried with all the cracking and popping, but had no issues after a few chew session with them. As others have stated, you can soften them up in the microwave when they start to get too small. Best use for us is that they keep the dogs occupied when we want them to settle down or when we are working from home. They would chew on these 24/7 if we had enough of them. Best consumable chews I've had to date, we will be purchasing more of them.

I figured it would be a repeat purchase for me.As soon as I opened the package and pulled one out, however, I was disappointed. The chew was covered in mold. I am returning these (obviously) and will now have to consider another seller. I can't take the chance that 1 in 4 chews will be useless every time.I'm sure this has been shipped perfect healthy to many customers, but for me, it's not worth chancing it.

If she didn't come immediately I would push the vibrate. It only took about 3 times for her to understand but I kept practicing the come for 3 days. Now comes the scary test if she would come immediately if she sees a bear. Perfection! She saw the bear, barked and when i said come she turned and come right by my side! I was so proud of her!

Purchased and took over last week and asked her to give it a try.  She was wary and assumed it was a shock collar but was surprised to learn it just It just beeps or vibrates.  She gave it a try, and we had a conversation!  All barking didn't stop completely, but it was a great improvement.
",0.8308634849,petsupplies,"Hahahahaha my youngest bulldog stopped barking instantly. She barked at almost anything that moved. I set the collar to vibrate and beep and she won’t bark. I am not sure how long I will have to have her wear this before she completely stops, we will see. Glad I have a peaceful time watching tv as she is out in the backyard with NO barking. I remove it when she comes in though and when it’s bedtime! Love the collar.

We did not like holding him down, but we did get a little tingle  of revenge when we snipped the razor sharp tips off his murder paws.There is a lot less bleeding when we play with him thanks to these trimmers.I especially liked the no slip grip when wrestling with psycho-kitty.

I felt very uncomfortable using it. I saw this one and the reviews were almost perfect. I tried the nail clipper! Wow! I feel more confident cutting her nails. These really cut nicely for beginners. I will be repurchasing the flat one too. Very clean and neat cuts! Also it’s very comfortable to hold and I really like how it’s compact and light.
",0.8977921650,petsupplies,"The scissors are a bit chunky. That, I believe, is to help people avoid nipping their pets nails too short, though I found it a bit difficult to see the nail and exactly where I was cutting. Still, for cat claw trimmers, this general style is the best I have used through my several decades of cat ownership. Some are slightly more streamlined than others maybe.

You know how it's hard to place scissor blades when you're looking in a mirror? It's like that. Your hand has to get used to placing the tiny clipper which is right up next to your fingers. But once you get  the claw and the clipper together, it's easier to just close the scissor than it was to hold the pliers. I like it, it's cheap, and I recommend it.

While volunteering for the SPCA of FL at the Orlando Cat Café, I grabbed a pair of their clippers to show a new adopting Mom how to clip her cats nails.

It took him a couple minutes to get used to walking in them but now he wears them without a problem.  They look like they are well made and are fleece lined for warmth.  They are easy to put on and take off.  I would recommend these to anyone who wants to protect their fur baby's feet during the cold wet winter months.

Note to other consumers: it works best with grocery bags - the scoop is too big for normal pet poop bags. Personally, I go raw, no bag. This is mainly for keeping the poop off my yard - clear the deck once a week and store it in the garage where I won't notice the stink. For that, I'm grateful.

I do not give them any other type of bones; and 6 months later when I took them to the vet this is what they said:The bones are too hard and even though they deteriorate as they chew on them the damage is done, both dogs have slab fractures in their molars and need to have them removed.Mind you my one dog is only 3 and now has no top molars thanks to these bones, I feel like a terrible dog parent and do not want this to happen to anyone else.

We now must get her a root canal to repair and save her fang, an upper canine. He suggested replacing these toys with Kong items.

My monster lab/poodle mix can DESTROY just about anything I buy for him . He snaps the ultra kongs in half without blinking and will crack even the largest Nylabones within a few minutes.  Even toys marketed as indestructible with money back warranties fall to their death in his jaws. That said .... HE LOVES THIS BONE and hasn't managed to do much damage to it which makes it one of the best chew toys I've ever encountered.
",0.1951899255,petsupplies,"Although my dog loved chewing this I have to give it one star because it’s not safe for him to consume and it very sharp if you brush up against it once it’s been chewed on.The description did advise to keep an eye on the dog to ensure they don’t eat it however it’s next to impossible to retrieve the piece they break off before it gets swallowed. My dog is a heavy chewer and broke a huge chunk off almost immediately and then swallowed it before we could take it away which caused a lot of concern. We were very lucky and it didn’t cause any medical problems but didn’t feel comfortable letting him have it.If you have a light chewer or a dog that doesn’t destroy its toys than this might be an option for you. It justs wasn’t a good fit for our dog. He now only gets things that can be safely digested just in case he sneaks a big bite, which he always does.
",0.0551338855,petsupplies,"This started off great! Our 8 month old GSP/hound rescue took to this right away. Luckily I supervised him while he used it because it only took one afternoon for him to chew off little pieces. I immediately took it away and pried the chunk out of his mouth before he could swallow it. Later that night I woke up to him vomiting - and yep, there were little pieces of nylon. I have not tried any other chew toys, we generally stick to bully sticks but I was hopeful reading all of the reviews. I never would have guessed our puppy would be considered an ""aggressive chewer"" since he is not inclined to chew much of anything except the random stuffed unicorn or bull sticks...... But now we know I guess!11/14/14So..... after writing my review the company contacted me and refunded double the cost of the product suggesting that maybe it was extra sharp ""puppy teeth"" that led to our issue.  I am open to that idea and we may try the product again down the road.  I feel bad leaving my rating at 1 star after the impeccable customer attention I received but as an amazon shopper I know that many folks read both the highest and lowest reviews while deciding on purchases and it's important for others to know that breakage is possible - especially with puppies!I would highly recommend this company and their product to others with adult, less-aggressive chewers!
",0.1741710355,petsupplies,"Watch your pups very closely with this bone!  My pup has had this less than a week and she's broken off several chunks big enough to worry me about her either choking or having a blockage if she swallowed them.  She's a strong chewer, but has never had this problem with other brands of nylon bones.  Those she whittles down over time, but the shards are tiny little scraps small enough for the vacuum to pick up or that safely pass through her system if she swallows them.
",0.0604748155,petsupplies,"For some reason, our golden-doodle prefers this over the traditional nylabone.  Maybe it's the flavor or shape; he's had it a few months so ""newness novelty"" would have worn off by now.It would be better if it didn't get all rough (see picture) and flake off little burrs of plastic that stick in socks and bare feet, but since big blocks of silicone don't satisfy chew cravings, and most other things are shredded in minutes, this is the best compromise I've found.Update:  after 6 months, he has really put a dent in it (second picture), but it continues to be a favorite.

God knows why, because it sure as hell does not taste like bacon....not that I've tried.We have 4 or 5 in the house right now because it's the only toy he does not immediately destroy. It's a very hard plastic, so great for strong chewers. As it gets worn, the edges get really rough so definitely keep an eye on your dog and make sure they're not hurting themselves. The wishbone shape is cute, but it's also pretty easy for my dog to hold between his paws when he goes to town on it. He closes his eyes and gnaws on it so passionately that I get a little jealous because I don't think I have ever enjoyed chewing something as much as my dog enjoys chewing this (and let's be real, we have WAY better stuff to chew than they do.)

He continued to chew the nub for about 5-10 Minutes. And when I checked it (I do in about 10-20 minute intervals) a good piece of the nub was missing. I wouldn’t have been concerned if it had been hours, but it was clear that a good sized nub was broken off and swallowed (we can not find the chunk) and continued to be chewed upon.

",0.026585455,petsupplies,"The best way to describe Benebone Jumbo Chew is to think about all the toys and bones you have purchased for your dog. Many of these toys aren't touched each day, let alone for over a week. Your dog gets bored. However, with the Benebone Jumbo Chew, your dog will be chewing on this bone not only each day but numerous times each day.

",0.556,petsupplies,"This is such a great leash! I use it for my Doberman pinscher. You never truly know what you’re going to get, which is why I was pleasantly surprised with this product and its features. I’ve only had it a short while but I’ve enjoyed it so much thus far I had to write a review. I will check in again if things go awry in the next few months, but here’s the rundown:CLASP: The clasp feels like a quality weight metal clasp, and is definitely strong enough for my 10 month old 72lb boxer pup. It is lightweight enough to use on a front clip harness, but large enough to attach to his thick brass ring on his 1.5” collar. It also is on a swivel, which is a great feature if your dog explores on walks rather than staying on one side of you. The swivel connection is not extremely loose but is fairly sturdy so it does not seem to weaken the strength of the clasp itself.ROPE: This is a lightweight medium thickness rope, good for medium to large dogs. The material of the rope is pliable and comfortable in my hands. It is durable enough that it doesn't fray easily from use or when my pup likes to hold the leash in his mouth when we walk. It does have a TINY bit of give to it, which is great for a dog that doesn’t always pull but who might pull with certain situations (squirrel!). A little bit of shock absorption is appreciated in a sudden erratic yank. I imagine if your dog constantly pulls ahead, this leash may stretch a bit after some use. The striping is indeed reflective, which is a nice safety feature too.SPLICES: This leash has leather or leather-like (I can’t tell until it wears a bit more) splices, which is a nice touch and adds to the overall quality of the leash. On some rope leashes, the rope can end at the splices, giving way to flat nylon near the clasp and handle, which compromises the integrity of the leash. This leash has full rope all the way through each splice.HANDLE: The handle is a continuation of the rope, but with a nylon cladding over the loop, which makes it comfortable to hold by preventing potential rope burn without added bulkiness that can accompany more thickly padded handles.

",0.8904427957,petsupplies,"I was really excited about finding such a cute and comfy bed for my dog.  This bed is not blush pink, it is an orangish pink.  It reminds me of when something red dyes your laundry.  It came from China in a grey bag so it appears a little misshapen.  I wish I would have chosen the grey or white.  I think if I fluff it in the dryer it will get it's shape back.  It is soft and I am sure my dog will love it.

She pulls it all around the house with her.  Glad I didn't follow the negative ratings I had read on this because for me...it has made my puppy a happy camper.  It is SUPER soft and comfy - even my cats try to get into it...when my Puppy let them.  Highly recommend this bed.
",0.8672877657,petsupplies,"Received the bed and the cat smelled and smelled of it and walked away, within a couple of minutes he returned and jumped into the bed and now rarely gets out of it.  He weighs 12 lbs and is long when he stretches out which he is able to easily do and frequently with his head hanging over the side which supports his head.  It is so soft, only wish it came in some different colors than gray which I ordered, also white and pink.  I would like a burgandy one but this company had the best prices.  I got the 23"" as some reviews said the bed ran small, some said it was too large but I ordered the 23"" and he has plenty of room to stretch full out and has extra room in it to easily move around to change positions.  I have not laundered it yet as he has only had it for 4 days.  It is so silky and soft, has plenty of padding and foam where he lays and the foam holds the sides up.  This is the bed to buy but please offer some more colors!!!
",0.7534210157,petsupplies,"My cats don't seem to like it much and it definitely is not what is pictured. What I received is a completely flat disk with no padding at all in the center where the cat would lay. The picture shows a tall, thick, well padded bed that the cat gets engulfed inside. What I received was nothing at all like that. It's  very wide, the sides are not tall, and the bottom is just a single layer of the fuzzy material and a layer of non-slip material, no padding.

With clippers, I wanted to make sure I could trim my dog without hurting her. I like how they are gentle but actual trim her hair. We usually take her to a groomer every couple months, so these are nice to have to trim random hairs in between professional grooms. I did try the guard but prefer to trim without it. It worked well on the bottoms of her paws, inside her ears, and other smaller areas on her body.

",0.1732016860,petsupplies,"Our dog loved this, unfortunately due to the design it didn't last long. The rope appears to be merely melted together and therefore split apart after about a half hour of playing. We are going to try to fix it but it's kind of dumb to make a tug of war toy this way. As for the suction, the only thing we could stick it to was our sliding door, and it came off after 15 min. Not bad!  It probably helped that our dog had no traction in this location.
",0.087891460,petsupplies,"Within an hour after my dog started to play with this toy, she hid pulled it off the door and destroyed the suction cup.  So we cut the cup off and gave her the rope and ball.  Within a few minutes the rope was destroyed .  Not worth the money!!!!!

Bought as a gift for a friend, this helps keep her medium-sized dog entertained in self “tug-a-war” matches. Made from durable materials, so should last.

",0.9683004660,petsupplies,"This is a really great toy! It keeps my dog entertained for a good bit. I will say, I own a golden retriever and he’s pretty strong so after 5 minutes of pulling he can get the suction off the floor, but he loves to play tug of war with the rope with me. I think this toy is probably best for smaller dogs

I like this comes with a guarantee, especially since my girls chew through everything I give them.  So far this bone is holding up, they love the smell.  I like that it's flexible, seems to be harder to chew.  I haven't seen any pieces off it yet.  I also like the nubs to stimulate their gums while chewing.  Overall a good bone for power chewers.

He is feral, so I'm not able to take him to the vet to make sure all the worms are gone for sure, but he is slowly thriving an gaining a bit more weight on his bony frame.

The ball comes with a small charge so you can try it right out of the box, but it also comes with a USB charging cord. It is a single power button that turns it on. So easy to use which is great since my sister has young children. A red light lights up inside the ball and attracts the cat to follow and play with it while the inside mechanism turns and rotates making the ball move sporadically all over the room.

At any rate, cats like it ok, nothing like their catnip-filled soft fur tufts, but the ball rolling all by itself is kind of fun for them now and then.  It's a bit too big really even for my big cat to get ahold of and do anything with so he tends to lose interest quickly, they will just sit back and watch the ball roll around until I shut it off.  It's an ok toy.

I struggled to squeeze dog treats into it - the hole on the bottom doesn't stretch or move at all.  That was very promising to me.-Light color.  I'm so tired of the superb strong chew toys being black because they're way too hard to find out in the yard and under beds or couches inside.-You can put treats inside for more entertainment.-My dog looks like he's in heaven while chewing this.Cons:-The green top was chewed off bit by bit within a few minutes of heavy chewing.  I have a border collie/golden retriever mix and he's an insane chewer, but since it just took him a few minutes, I don't rate the top as being made with a dog that actually chews in mind.  He sure did love doing that though!  Luckily, he doesn't eat what he chews up so I would just advise others to supervise while their dog chews on this.

",0.8992843666,petsupplies,"I was looking for a replacement pet bed for my elderly cat. His original bed was a dog bed I had purchased at another store however after years of use it had gotten into a really disgusting state. It was large and cumbersome and unwashable, But it had firm sides that he could recline against if he wanted to. Finally that old pet bed needed to be thrown away because it was basically destroyed and so I started searching for something that could be machine washed if it got dirty and my search led me to this bed. It came in a very small compact box But as soon as I unwrapped it the bed started increasing in size due to the foam being allowed to expand as designed. I was impressed with how it started to take shape. Within five minutes of putting the pet bed in the spot of the old, beloved bed, my elderly cat jumped in it, as shown by the photos. He shuffled around, made some circles, and settled right down in it to groom himself and that’s where he remains. I know the manufacturers instructions say it takes 24 hours to fully formed into its proper shape but I don’t mind and neither does the cat. He’s quite happy with it the second I put it down in front of the fireplace. I will update the review to see how long he sleeps in it but I suspect he will enjoy several hours of naps.
",0.1841382466,petsupplies,"I love how the cat bed has an interchangeable cushion, which my cat liked a lot. She kept coming in and out of the bed, exploring and seeing if it was hers. The beds soft and warm and my cat kept playing and walking in and out of the bed in less than 24 hrs of getting it. So I’d say I’ll be seeing more of this bed, and hopefully my cat continues to enjoy it :) For people looking to buy, the bed is bigger than it looks when you open the box it’s packaged in. And my cat enjoys it!
",0.8972542966,petsupplies,"I do not have a cat but I do have a small dog. It took a little while once opened to fluff up, but once it did I was surprised by how big it is. The inside flips so there is a summer side and a winter wide. My dog greatly likes the bed. He has been using that over all of his other beds in the house.
",0.1817075366,petsupplies,"Great cat bed, one of our cats absolutely loves  it!
",0.9245843966,petsupplies,"The cats seem to like the bed. It seems like it is warming as they like to use it now that it is cold.  It’s large enough where 2 cats could fit if you have cats that like to snuggle.
",0.2171848466,petsupplies,"Overall, a great product! We have an outdoor cat, and he really loves this. He is nice and snuggly on cold days and prefers to lay on a separate towel on warmer days. So, the self-warming technology must really work! The short fabric is soft, but doesn't catch lots of muck even though it's outside.Our only complaint is that this was larger than we really wanted, but we could not find a comparable product in a smaller size.

",0.8419945267,petsupplies,"I've bought a few of these rings from different manufacturers; my 3 dogs love them. This red one is very hard, and at first, I was worried they wouldn't like it quite as much as a rubber one that's a bit chewier. I was wrong - they actually like this one just as well, or maybe a bit better. This is made of a material similar to the ultratough Nylabones, and so far it's holding up just as well as they do. The 3 dogs have very different chewing styles and they are all intense chewers. This is hoding up to them very well. I've got 3 happy pups chewing on this one!
",0.7937337267,petsupplies,"I like this toy for my dog, but I wish it was slightly lighter and had more give to his chewing. Overall, great toy that kept my dog occupied.
",0.1838242167,petsupplies,"Good for my aggressive chewer and great for my chill dog.  They love when we put a little PB or sweet potato or pumpkin puree in this toy.  It keeps them busy and out of our hair for a good hour. The aggressive chewer hasn't taken a chunk out of it yet, but I'm not holding my breath.This is a hard plastic toy and solid.  There isn't much for my aggressive chewer to get a good hold on to gnaw away on. It's about the size of my hand with fingers spread out.  Small enough to my aggressive chewer at 26 lbs, but also big enough for my husky at 60lbs to enough and not swallow!
",0.1861510967,petsupplies,"Very durable. A little harder than I expected but I was glad of that since we have a dog that will tear most things up. I thought it would have a hole to put peanut butter in but I have been putting a little in the cracks and he's loving that just as much (probably more). I imagine this will last a long time.
",0.2326592267,petsupplies,"MY French Bulldog is over the moon for this toy, and I am loving that she is finally chewing on something other than furniture corners!

",0.9865161267,petsupplies,"This is a very heavy duty dog toy. My dog usually shreds any toy you give him.  This one is still intact.  It keeps him busy and you can add peanut butter or another treat on it to really get your dog excited. It is a little heavy  a good fit for my dog.
",0.8969458367,petsupplies,"Bought 2 of these (one each for our yellow lab and our German Shepherd)based on reviews and received yesterday (November 2nd). I liked the idea of putting peanut butter on them and freezing. That worked well. It’s after that’s not so great. Then it’s just a hard plastic chew toy-NOT AT all suitable for my almost 12 year old yellow lab. I was watching him try to get the rest of the peanut butter off this morning. When I checked the toy to see how much more he’d gotten off, I saw that he’d chewed off some of the plastic. I IMMEDIATELY took both toys away.We were given a 100% refund from this company.  I added 2 more stars for 3.
",0.8168305267,petsupplies,"My two aggressive chewers sanded a lot of the molding off so now it’s more of a smooth ring. I wouldn’t advertise “indestructible” for they bit a lot of the ring off. I still like it for them because they enjoy chewing it

",0.1486299667,petsupplies,"I liked it at first but then my dog who is an aggressive chewer was going to town on it, I thought he was going to break a tooth so I had to take it away from him.  It may work better for fetch in a pool but definitely not for aggressive chewers.

It has lasted well.My outdoor cat needed a collar so it wasn't mistaken for a stray.  That collar only lasted for about a week before it got all fuzzy to the point you couldn't read the contact information.I bought a different brand for one of my dogs that I would rebuy for the outdoor cat next time....the contact info is printed on vs. stitched so I think would work better.
",0.2420441868,petsupplies,"The collars are sturdy, and the embroidery was legible. Unfortunately, even though I completed the form correctly, the background color and text colors were switched. Also, I feel like they loosen very easily. I've had to tighten both dogs' collars multiple times since we got these. But, they are cute and I like having the name/number on the collar itself.
",0.7564333168,petsupplies,"I bought two of these collars for my dogs.  The print is very clear. But as said it does get covered by the clip on the collar. But if my dogs were to be lost they would just have to remove the collar to read the phone number. They were coming a little loose so I just took a stitch on each side to hold them in place. Would definitely order them again.

The buckle was cheap looking and I didn't trust it. All and all the collars I purchased were a big waste of money after I waited waaaay too long for delivery. I had their names printed on the collars so they were even useless to the humane society.
",0.116120468,petsupplies,"This is a very nice collar. I bought the largest one. My lab is 124 lbs and very stocky. It’s plenty large enough for her. It’s made well. She has lost her tags before. This is the perfect alternative for identification. It took a little while but I expected that. Ours is turquoise with hot pink writing and it looks great. Moose gets tired of everyone thinking she’s a “he” so it looks pretty feminine.  I would definitely recommend this seller. I expect it will last a while.
",0.9275997968,petsupplies,"Such a cute collar. I love that you are able to customize the colors & that it is slightly reflective. I ordered a size medium for Pepper & it fits perfectly. I will update later with how well this collar holds up but I am very impressed.
",0.9757615368,petsupplies,"I like that its not too bulky so my dog can wear it all the time.  I think this is much better than having a tag that can make noise. I like the embroidery option because you know it won't rub off.  The small was perfect for my Cavalier King Charles.  Shipment was quick even though it came from China.
",0.9768090868,petsupplies,"To me the color isn’t that close to the one pictured.  I ordered the aqua-ish colored one but got more of a teal.  I just got it so I don’t know how it”ll last but it looks ok.

One of the ropes has the frayed part on the end so we have to watch one of our dogs if she plays with that one because she likes to pull the string out one by one and eat it lol Other than that our 3 pits love these. I personally love the ball!!
",0.8207961969,petsupplies,"Very disappointed in this product.  This must have been rated for an extra large small dog.  This states that it is an XL dog rope when in fact it is fit more for a medium size dog and maybe some large dogs but definitely NOT and extra large.  I'm sure my actual extra large dog will have this torn to pieces in no time.  Definitely NOT what I expected and when i get him an actual XL dog rope, I posted a picture  comparison of what an XL dog rope looks like next to this ""XL"" rope. The black and orange one is the XL one I had to buy to replace the little one I got from here.

Highly recommended!

",0.8423327270,petsupplies," This pet heating pad was amazing. I struggled a lot to wrap or cover my puppy with a blanket or a shirt to warm him up. This pad would do the trick in heating him up this upcoming winter season. It is indeed a waterproof pad that is practical to use for any pets in the house. As soon my puppy saw the pad, he immediately grabbed the cord and tried to bite it, but apparently, my puppy could not damage it, which really pleased me. The size of the pad was just the exact and appropriate fit for small dogs. Overall, I am loving this pad because it helps to keep my precious Maltipoo warm and cozy when the temperature outside is freezing.

I didn’t notice any smell from the pad heating up, and I liked how compact the electronic unit is. Further, I was glad to see the cord is at least somewhat protected. I suppose a cat or dog could chew through it, but there a lot of cords way less protected than this one in my house.Overall, I wasn’t sure I needed this, but I suppose it wasn’t for me. The cats are going to cozy up well this winter.

I've used this for the bed and for my feet too, yo warm them up. I love it too ! Super easy to spot clean if needed. My dog doesn't chew the cord either. I would recommend this to anyone. Oh!

There are two heat settings, which over time I will figure out which is her preferred setting. I feel like my little best friend will enjoy this as the weather gets colder.

That is 45minutes of NON-STOP AGGRESSIVE CHEWING. When the dogs chew it down to where it's unsafe - just pop it in the microwave and it becomes a new, flaky, treat that they can eat without worry of getting lodged in their throat.  I will never buy another chew for my dogs.

I’m including photos of how I attach a small Tennis ball to the end of the stick to prevent the dog from swallowing the last chunk. I haven’t had this problem but do note that if your dog drops the stick repetitively on concrete it will probably break. They are quite brittle.

After a couple of weeks of daily treat sessions with the grinder on and off I have been able to have a calm grooming session with him.

Wish me luck getting the cat on board!

(2) The metal grinding wheel does not need to be replaced and does the job for all dogs (I tried it on a golden retriever and an Australian Shepherd). (3) It's about half as loud as the Oster. The first time I used the Oster on the Aussie, she jumped off the table, but the quieter Peteast grinder did not frighten her. And although the golden will tolerate the noisy Oster, the ease of using the Peteast grinder will assure that pet owners will do nails more frequently and thus expose their dogs to less discomfort.

The slowly started on one nail (lots of treats). By the end she was pretty comfortable.The downside of this thing is the smell. It stinks bad (like burning hair). It's also a little messy.The LED light didn't seem to shine on the right spot so I just went to a better lit area.I'm not sure how long the grinder part will last (how many uses). The whole thing is rechargeable which is really great.I also tried this on my larger dog. It took much longer on her bigger nails.There are 2 speeds, a lower, slower speed and a higher faster speed.

The grinder was not loud so that was helpful in keeping him calm.  His nails are very thick and difficult to cut, so it we were able to grind and round off his nails.  Smoothing his nails also made his run on our hardwood floors more gentle.  If you grind them indoors, just put a paper towel under his paw to catch the dust....then just pick up and throw away.  Easy.
",0.7937724673,petsupplies,"Just trimmed by yellow labs nails (very big dog) and it worked well (except him squirming). I like that it has a couple seeds and the rindin tool is not sandpaper which wears out. The stone used works we and doesn't seem it will wear out soon.
",0.8127541573,petsupplies,"Hi. I have a one-year old hyper Yorkshire Terrier. In the past, I purchased a nail clipper for him, however; it was impossible to keep him still long enough to use it. This definitely makes it easier because It grinds the nail instead of clipping it. Also, my dog is afraid of loud noises and this product is very quiet. Great product and will definitely continue to use it!

",0.2070794174,petsupplies,"I have 5 cats and they all love this toy! It quickly became the focal interest the moment I turned it on. The toy is made of high quality and feels like it will last a long time. It really keeps the cats interactive and finally, a toy that’s not a waste of money. The cats couldn’t stop chasing the toy so it was hard to get a good picture but I provided what I could capture. Highly recommend to fellow cat owners!! It’s definitely feline approved in our household!
",0.8645522674,petsupplies,"From the box: The wheel unit itself, USB cable (no charger), 2 screw on options (feather and yellow ball). The wheel unit looks like a well built. The wheels are made of silicon like, so it has really good grip on wood floor and tile. There's only 1 button to turn on/off, and USB charging port. I have not run this through entire day so don't know how long the battery would last. I would imagine the cats would get tired before the battery runs out. It claims to have sensor and know before running into walls. Flashing LED on both side of the wheels makes it even more attractive to the cats. Works right out of the box. It's fast, spontaneous which make the cats love them.
",0.1219081374,petsupplies," My cats are spoiled. When I don’t have time to play with them, I give them this toy to keep them entertained. The quality of this toy is so GOOD and It’s rechargeable. Automatic cat ball works good on both hard floor and soft carpet. The toy was very engaging with my cats when turned it on. Surprisingly, my cats love it! The toy can also be played powered off. It passively balanced itself. Moreover, I think the toy is perfect for both dogs and cats. I’m going to change the tip to their favorite mouse once they destroy the default feather. Lol Also add some catnip maybe.
",0.8345496774,petsupplies,"My two cats like this but my 10 month old baby loves this cat toy! She chased it around the house. It is very sturdy and withstands her destructive play.

Definitely recommend!

Now they come running from wherever they are in the house to play with it when they hear it come on.  My cats are a little aggressive and keep tearing to toys off but they go back on easy.  We all can't help but watch them play.
",0.1351203674,petsupplies,"All 3 cats (ages 5, 4 and 3) love this toy and so do I. I like that it's tall enough that it doesn't fit under furniture or appliances so there is no digging it out constantly, unlike most of their other toys. This toy works perfectly with no problems. It also has a really long battery life between charges. It's easy to charge with the USB cord that is included. It moves quickly in all directions across my hardwood & tile floors. It has no trouble transitioning on/off of my area rugs and never gets stuck. Best of all, the cats are loving it and come running whenever I get it out of the hiding place and turn it on. They watch & wait for it to pause, then they pounce. This is one of the best toys I've ever purchased for my cats and it's well worth the cost. The features all work exactly as described.
",0.8812029474,petsupplies,"Hahaha! This thing goes nus all over the place, driving the kitties attention away from destroying my stuff, or attacking my feet.It's quite funny to watch.If you have kittens or cats with way too much energy, and you can't play with them as much as they want you to, then this should do the trick!
",0.1076159274,petsupplies," I really like this toy but my cats don’t seem to care for it. It seems to be made really well for the price point but just isn’t something my cats care too much for 🙁. I think they’re scared of it.

He suffers from separation anxiety and will bark his head off when anyone tries to leave, so this leads to a series of barking every morning when I head out to work.We’ve tried calming treats, lots of exercise, distracting toys, but nothing seems to work.His foster had lived in an apartment and mentioned that she would use a training collar to keep him in check, so we looked around online and found this PATPET collar.The package comes with everything you need to get going, including necessary accessories for contact if you plan to use the shocking mechanism.My wife and I built a morning routine where I would walk him, and upon our return, place the collar on him. I would grab my things and leave, and when he tried to start barking, she would send a small vibration buzz. Once I leave, she would remove the collar. It’s almost to the point where you don’t even have to turn on the collar - he just knows not to bark!This collar has definitely helped instill better habits for our pup, definitely provides more features (like water resistance) that we required.

The dog training collar kit comes with two different size probe tips depending on the size of your dog and thickness of the coat as well as optional silicone probe covers. The kit also comes with four AAA batteries: two for the collar and two for the remote. The strap is very long but can be adjusted and cut to length depending on the circumference of your dogs neck. Also included is a test lamp to ensure the probes are operational for the shock setting. The instruction manual is easy to read and setup was a breeze. The remote has a power button on the side and three large buttons on the front including beep, vibrate, and shock. Additional settings include fully adjustable vibrate and shock levels which can be adjusted up/down via buttons on the side for customized strength for your dog. Also these settings can be programmed for two different dogs and easily toggled between the two via a button the side.

",0.9397730876,petsupplies,"Although I bought this for my medium size dog, one of my littles kept ending up with it. I had to share the picture of her carrying it. It has been very durable so far which is great because there are a lot of toys my pumps have killed in less than a day.

My dogs love it, so it looks like I'll be needing to grab a couple more!!

It doesn't feel like it will break easy and it has a small protrusion at the bottom that allows it to give a little when the cats swat at it so it doesn't fall over.-The buttons are easy to access and clear in their purpose.-The speeds vary and have the option of fast, slow, or random.-It has a timer with reasonable active periods.  I'm terrible at just leaving things on, I like the timer because my fat cats are also suuuuper lazy.  So there really isn't a need to have it on all day.Over all, I'm very pleased with this product.

They all wanted to catch the red dotband when one thought they caught it another went after him tryingbto take the red dot away from them lol.This was bigger than i expected it to be but thats actually a good thing.  I also thoughtbthe base looked like it had a rubberish look but it is plastic adding weight where its needed to keep it from being tipped to easily.This was supposed to be a christmas present but i had to put batteries in it to make sure it worked and the cats wont leave it alone so may just be a present for doing a good job transitioning from old house to new home.This is a awesome gift idea for anyone with cats because as any pet owner will tell yountheir pets are their babies and who doesnt love when people get their kids a awesome present.
",0.7957657677,petsupplies," My cat thoroughly enjoyed the Cat Laser Toy from the minute I removed it from the box. We have had a difficult time finding toys that he will actually play with. We definitely found a great one this time. From the minute I turned it on, he was chasing the laser. He enjoyed chasing the laser as well as spinning the toy on it's base. My dogs were also very interested in this toy. I had to move it to a room where my cat could play in peace without interference from them. I like the different speed options as well as the different timers that are available. The design is also pretty solid and will hold up to some rough playing from the dogs. This is a great toy and I highly recommend it.
",0.9175690477,petsupplies,"What is it that I have to say that would compare the Tumbler Laser Cat Toy versus any other cat laser toy that is currently being sold today, whether it is walk in type that you get there by means of moving one’s body parts and possibly using any type of vehicle that would get you to that actual building or if you were to actually order a cat laser unit using devices that come in various sizes from the handheld ones to the one that lays flat on a surface without leaving the building you are currently in and using the Amazon app or by the Amazon website... there is no comparison actually because I have already given the Tumbler Laser Cat Toy it’s First Place Award.  And now I will proceed to list the reasons why.... it is actually hands free with 360degree as the laser circles.  The unit has four various speeds.  The seems to use minimal battery power making you to replace dead batteries not as often as the rest.  Being that it has the Tumbler in its name means that the unit will have no worries of being tipped over.  It is good size too, not to big and it does not take up space.  It comes in a pleasant color and as one of the settings is the timer so it shuts off once the timer is off and you or I would have no worries leaving it on
",0.577,petsupplies," I am really impressed with this cat toy. It’s made of a really hard plastic so it’s very durable if there’s some rough play. The rounded bottom makes it harder for the cat to knock it over. The 3 speeds for the laser light is great, sometimes my cat likes a change. My favorite part is the timer, I can just turn it on and do whatever I was doing and let him play an it automatically shuts off. My cat is an inside cat and I had been looking for something to help him get more excercise he’s getting a little chubby as he’s gotten older. The light just doesn’t go around in a circle it stops and reverses to keep your cat entertained. This is a great laser toy.
",0.7740083977,petsupplies," This automatic laser toy is awesome!! It’s so nice to be able to turn it on and watch my cats AND my dog have so much fun trying to catch the little red dot ! 🤣 Everytime I bring this toy out my dog goes NUTS! He can’t wait for me to turn it on and will barely give the cats a turn to play! It has several different settings and quite a few timer options which is really cool! It’s also pretty sturdy! It has handled some rough housing by my 115lb dog and the cats are constantly swiping at it. It has a rounded bottom so it just sways with each swat and nose boop! In the past when I buy these types of toys I realize rather quickly that they suck through batteries within, like, a day! But I have had this toy on more often than not since I received it a week ago and it’s still trucking!  I highly recommend this product if you like the idea of simply pressing a button and watching your fur babies get to playing! 😺😺
",0.9692892477,petsupplies," My kitten and dog absolutely love this toy. It keeps them entertained for the entire time I set the timer. The different settings are great and it wobbles back and forth so it does not just go around in a perfect circle. I have a regular hand held laser pointer that they love but I’m over playing with it after 5 minutes and they want to keep playing. With this toy, it’s so easy to use and requires no effort. Just push the button and they are occupied for 10, 15 or 20 minutes.
",0.9310398777,petsupplies," My cats love this toy, especially my younger one, although my older cats likes to sneak up on it once in a while.I think the fastest speed setting is too fast so I keep it on the lowest setting and you can time it to go off after 15 minutes. It keeps my very energetic cat entertained and wears her out so she sleeps better at night with me.Very sturdy construction and does not break even when cats knock it around.  Does not come with AAA BATTERIES. you need to install 3 of them.
",0.7792738177,petsupplies," This toy interested my 8 month old kitten and my 8 year old cat. The kitten can knock it over so i wish it was a little heavier where it wouldn't end up on its side.  All in all It will amuse them both for whatever time you put on the timer.It is easy to use.. The only assembly is putting batteries in it.  I wish it was rechargeable like some of the cat toys i have bought recently.Very pleased with my pur-chase.
",0.1020006578,petsupplies,"These arrived fast and are pretty cute. Definitely nice Christmas colors, the green is just right and the red is very vibrant.The collars are actually quite large which is a nice change of pace for me because I've often bought some that aren't big enough. I needed to tighten the collar even for my 17 pound cat so I can say with confidence these are big enough for any domestic housecat. I do think these would be too big for small kittens. It fits my very small cat ok but we have it as tight as it will go. Because they are so large I think you would be able to fit these around very small dogs like chihuahuas, but I do not have a small dog to test that theory.I like the bell on the collar, bells always make my cats playful (and harder to take a picture of). The flower is super cute. It looks great on my short hair cats but it might get smashed / lost in the hair if you had longer hair cats.Cute collars for Christmas parties for sure.

Unfortunately, that usually means me trailing behind picking up the snowstorm of stuffing. I usually pick up a toy from the grocery store once per week for him to tear up, but these are a great alternative.

They each have two squeakers, and even better, no stuffing. However, they still satisfy my dog's urge to destroy. In playing, he quickly disposed of the limbs and squeakers of the one I've given him so far, but the leftover toy carcass still remains and he's been having a blast with it.These are perfect to satisfy the urge of your destroyer without all the cleanup (save for a handful of discarded squeakers and limbs.

",0.7548203582,petsupplies,"Purchased these for my miniature dachshund.  The poor thing has been biting her nails for months now.  We have taken her to the vet, put her on allergy meds, tried hemp oil and purchased her a thunder shirt.  The vet isn’t sure if she has allergies or if she is suddenly suffering from anxiety.  I did purchase her allergy drops and tried her on them for a few weeks.  She seemed to improve but suddenly decided that she didn’t want to take them anymore.  I went online and tried to find allergy treats in hopes that they would help.  So far these have worked great.  She likes the taste and she isn’t chewing her nails as much.
",0.0291999982,petsupplies,"Decided to try these Bc my dog chews her paws all the time. It took her several days to not spit them out but it’s amazing how much they helped. I dont know if the taste was acquired or what but now she takes them no problem and less chewing on her paws. Win win!

No more marathon itching and no more raw skin.  What more could I ask for!  When you live in the country, fleas happen.  You cannot get away from them when deer, raccoons and other creatures carry them into the yard.  Nice to have something to make her less miserable!

I also liked that the light goes red and the pump shuts down when it runs dry.Ultimately, they both love it, and I’m hoping to completely replace their regular bowl soon.

",0.8922250383,petsupplies,"I bought a different kind of filtering water bowl for my cats originally, and they and my 90 lb dog loved the flowing water. Recently, we got a Newfoundland puppy, and if you know anything about Newfoundlands, is they love water and they drool a lot! She loved the other bowl, but it was just too shallow and she’d dip her ears in it. I saw how this bowl was shaped and knew I had to try!She LOVES it. We now have both bowls going on each side of the house, so we don’t have to always be refilling them, and the cats and the dog are obsessed. It keeps the water clean and fresh since it’s constantly circulating, and it is quiet! The mat is nice because it doesn’t slip. Also, my puppy would chew on the top spout of the other bowl, but since this one doesn’t have a spout, she can’t chew it! And, it’s too heavy for her to pick up and drag around. We’re very happy with it!

I bought two other fountains and had to return them - she wouldn't use them, maybe because they were noisy or small. She took to this one right away - it's quiet, or for whatever reason, she drinks out of it many times a day - Good for her to get some exercise going to it too. Her kidney function is improving and she's feeling better and I think this fountain has played a big role in her improvement. I bought a 2nd one to put in the other side of the house for her. This fountain also has almost all ceramic parts while the other fountains were plastic. We're not using the charcoal filters because we add filtered water to the bowl. We clean it once a week.

It was cute and funny at the beginning but then it became a hassle because if you ignore him, he starts yelling at you :D I saw one of those at my friend's place and decided to get one. Since then. this thing is a lifesaver. My cat drinks almost a half-gallon of water. He plays with the fountain part as well and he really enjoys it.

",0.099423885,petsupplies,"I live in a house with 2 dogs and 5 cats. Zoe (Black and White) and Bambi (Chihuahua) have always been terrified when it was time to trim their nails. I've tried many different nail clippers over the years and no matter how sharp the clippers or how far away I'd cut from the quick, their nails would split and crack down to the quick making my dogs yelp and sometimes bleed. I tried using a Dremel with a stone grinding bit and still it was a hassle. The noise from the Dremel along with it skipping off their nail and sometimes grinding into my fingers was just as bad. Nail trimming was always dreaded by myself and my dogs. I bought the oneisall 2 Speed Powerful Dog Nail Grinder on sale because I didn't have much faith in it's ability to grind down the tough thick nails Zoe has. I was weary when I received it because it was very light weight and it reminded me of those cheap foot care grinders you can buy at the drug store that the second you touch them to your feet they lock up. Yes, I tried using those too to grind down my dogs nails, they were useless. Much to my surprise though when I turned on the grinder it was whisper quiet and when I touched it to Zoe's thick overgrown nail it started melting it down like butter. The grinder would bog down a little but happily whittled her nails down. Zoe stayed perfectly relaxed and never winced or pulled away. There was no look of fear in her eyes or me having to coax her back to trim the next nail; she just laid down on the porch happy and content as if I were petting her. For 11 years it has been a real struggle to keep her nails trimmed and now I've finally found a solution that really works for me and my dogs.Pro's:Light weightPowerfulFastQuietAffordableCons:I don't know what to say here. It take 2 hours to charge?
",0.0485686485,petsupplies,"This works amazing. It's made well and is pretty quiet. My dog does not like her nails touched but had no problem letting me use this on her. It works pretty quickly as well. A must have for dog owners. I love that it's rechargeable!
",0.9145339785,petsupplies,"I have four dogs. Two 65lbs boys, 13 lbs and 19lbs girls. One boy and both girls are easy enough to trim nails. One boy has to be taken to the vet, he HATES his feet being touched.We wanted this nail grinder for the other three. It took a really long time to fully charge, bit once it was charged, we took it off the charger. We just did the nails, today. I was actually able to hold each dog on my own, and didn't need help! We got them used to the sound and vibration, first, with high value homemade liver treats. Then I just did their nails! It's never been this easy before. I wish it had just a bit more power for my big boys nails, but it did its job well. It was light weight, easy to hold. I have MS with weakness in my hands. I LOVE how I can get close to the nail quick without making it bleed. No more flinching and pulling away. No more sharp, ragged nails. No more shaking and crying...me or the dogs! :0)I completely recommend this nail grinder!Only wish it had an LED light so you can better see what you're doing.
",0.7623157585,petsupplies,"I like the solid quality of this compact, sleek-looking device.  It's very quiet (except when it's actually touching the nail), easy to handle, and arrived fully charged, so I used it right away.  My dog doesn't like it, but she's never been fond of anyone handling her feet or toes, so I'm hoping she'll get more comfortable with it in time.  It DOES its job, so I'd recommend that everyone who uses it trims only a very little bit during each session, perhaps separated by a week or ten days --especially if your pet's nails are long.  Seems to me that it would be easy to get to the quick of the nail with carelessness or too much force, and the quick retreats as you gradually shorten the nails.  VERY happy with this item and its price!
",0.9138270685,petsupplies,"We’ve been through several different nail trimmers and never had any success until we got these. Both our dogs just layer there and let us trim their nails without constant fidgeting or trying to get away. They are extremely quiet and trim the nails gently. I would highly recommend these to anyone with pets that are sensitive to loud noises and don’t like their nails being trimmed.
",0.1859000385,petsupplies,"have never done my dogs' nails before, mostly because the quick was way too long and I was afraid to cut it. But I recently learned that the quick recedes eventually if you keep cutting the nails. So I searched for clippers and found a dremel instead. It works great. My dogs were little afraid of it but after lots of praising and lot of treats they let me do it. Still, it was a struggle; probably because we have never done it before. I am hoping with time they will get used to it. I will definitely recommend this to friends and family.
",0.7906718985,petsupplies,"LOVE this grinder. It's quieter than the Oaster grinder and the dremel dog nail grinder as well. It came charged and ready to use. I have used 4 times already since I have gotten it and I still haven'thad to charge it yet! I have 2 dogs, and neither mind it at all. It's easy to use on my large breed husky mix.

He came from a shelter about six months ago, but it's safe to say he still suffers from stress and trust issues due to his experience there. Needless to say, claw clipping time has always been a heartbreaking struggle in our house, but it appears it won't be any longer thanks to this contraption. He was a little scared at first of the noise, but with a little coaxing and a couple treats, I was able to get him to sit still for his whole trim! (Prior to this, he would only stay put for a couple clippings before scampering off.)I cannot speak for the durability of this contraption, but in regards to my initial reaction, I am absolutely impressed.

",0.9017571886,petsupplies,"I took a chance on this product as there aren't many reviews. I am so glad I bought it! The silicone is just the right amount of thickness that it makes it easy to clean. It also has cute little paw prints on them as decor that's subtle and not cheesy. I put 1 automatic cat feeder and their water fountain (they're spoiled, so sue me) on the mat without any issue. The feeder is a little longer than the mat, but it easily sits on the edge without tilting. The cats don't seem to be bothered by it as it was a new thing for them. I will have to buy another one for the other cat now. I'm glad I purchased it on a whim. Great product!!!  Even better is that there is no chemical smell to it, especially compared to other products I've bought off Amazon. I definitely will recommend this to my friends and family!I think it can even work as a litter mat too as it has a raised edged.
",0.9459083186,petsupplies,"My cat is the messiest eater you’ll ever meet in your life. She chews with her mouth open and gets a little over enthusiastic sometimes with her turkey & gravy. I used to place her food bowls on top of newspapers, but her wet food would leak through the paper or she would rip up the newspaper. Meal times often ended with a lot of cleaning.  We just bought this mat recently and our cat has been very receptive to it. I’m so glad I got this right before winter started. We have hardwood and tiled floors around the house and last winter we tried everything from a mat to a thin towel to put under the newspaper so she wouldn’t be as cold while she ate but everything just got dirty so quick and we’d have to wash the mats/towels all the time. It wasn’t time effective at all. The mat is warmer to step on than a tiled/hardwood floor which does wonders in the winter.Pros:-Great size: It fits small sized food bowls comfortably and still has ample space for the cat to stand on.-Easy to clean: I just give it a quick wipe down once a day and it dries in minutes!-Great material: The little edges keep my cat’s mess from leaking onto the floor and the material’s grip keeps her food rack from moving around.-Keeps the floor dry which means one less thing for me to clean.-Attractive design with a nice neutral color.10/10 would recommend! This food mat is truly a hidden gem!

",0.9846634986,petsupplies,"#376 INVENHO Dog Bed Kennel CrateI bought this for our 4.5 month old PitBull puppy.  It came packaged in a vacuum sealed bag, and when open it expanded into full size.  It is very soft (the texture of the fleece has a cool rosette pattern) and the padding is about 1” thick.  The 42” size fits our crate perfectly and London layed down on it and napped right away...he approved that is for certain!  The underside of the mat has grip dots to help keep it from sliding around.  Currently, our pup is teething, so for now he only uses it when supervised.  The fill is cotton and it is important that your dog is over the chewing stage or he will make a mess of his nice bed.  The listing states the same--it is durable, yet not intended for biting on.  Machine washable, and handwashing better.  Easy way to wash it would be to hang it over your fence and hose it off and use a bit of dish soap, then rinse again; ring out excess water and hang dry.  I suggest at least twice monthly so that the bed stays fresh.

",0.1081314798,petsupplies,"This cordless rechargeable canine nail grinder is high quality, ergonomic, and easy to use. The kit comes with a USB charging cord, extra grinding attachment, nail guard, and a cap. The nail grinder has a ridged rubber pad on the backside for improved comfort and better grip. The front of the grinder has a rubber power button and another rubber button to adjust the speed to low, medium, or high. Simply push the button until the desired speed is displayed on the lighted display below. The grinder contains the newer lithium ion style batteries for quick recharge times and long battery life. This powerful efficient grinder made quick work of my 40 lb. canine companion’s nails and only required 1-2 seconds of contact on the lowest setting to remove the sharp tips of the nails which is all that is needed. With the extra long battery life of the lithium battery I will probably be able to trim his nails dozens of times without a recharge. The grinder is also much quieter than I expected with a mild “hum” noise on low and minimal vibration. This cordless rechargeable canine nail grinder screams quality and is an excellent value. It has the look and feel of a more commercial style grinder. I have zero complaints.
",0.8272434598,petsupplies," I don't have to cut our ESA's nails, as they do not grow long due to daily walks, but I do need to keep them smooth. I've been looking for a good nail grinder. This product works well. I love that I don't need batteries. It also seems sturdy. My last mail grinder broke, it was light weight, and took forever to file the nail down. This grinder worked quickly, even on low. My dog was calm, and all four paws took less than 10 minutes to have filed smooth. It keeps a great charge! This grinder takes a couple seconds of holding down the power button to turn on.
",0.754818898,petsupplies,"Compact size and very easy to use. I have never used a nail grinder before and clip my dogs’ nails weekly. I used this for smoothing the nails after clipping since they tend to be so sharp immediately following a trim. The dogs didn’t know what to think about it, I think more because of the sound than anything else, but once they realized it wasn’t a big deal they calmed down and let it happen. Would definitely recommend this product, especially for the price!
",0.7705579498,petsupplies," Using this grinder is so much easier than having to trim my dog’s nails. Also, it’s nice for smoothing sharp edges when we do happen to use the nail clipper first. It’s not too loud which is nice because it doesn’t scare my puppy. It has a few speed settings, I prefer the highest setting.

Since she had no idea what this new contraption was she didn't hide.  I turned it on and it made barely a whisper.  I gently took her paw and placed a nail against the grinder.  In about 2 seconds her nail was the perfect length.  She just sat there like a good dog.  Afterwards I gave her a treat and booped her on the head and off she trotted to cause some mischief.  I'm very glad I got these trimmers.

",0.958839541,electronics,"I see so many people on here who are technology ""experts""  stating how its slow and it sucks and its awful and its build quality is awful.With due respect its build quality is in line with paying $150 bucks for a 10.1"" tablet.  Yes its plastic, yes its screen is only 1900x1200, yes its Media Tek processor is not the top processor available today, yes it ONLY has 2GB of ram.  However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.  I have zero productivity apps on it (which i like) I have zero communication apps on it (which I like), This tablet for me is a way to get away from life.  I have a phone for talking, and work, and teams, and slack.Dont kid yourself, this is not a high end tablet.

Couldn't this be optimized better?I'm now quite upset and decided to return it, for the poorly designed software that drains battery and my deleted review by amazon!
",0.0578223471,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.0830963251,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.9716997151,electronics,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.

",0.8478666542,electronics,"Sound quality is the best I've heard on a speaker of this size!!!  Definitely worth paying a little extra for this one over the 2nd generation model.  I'm not going to discuss the functionality as there's tons of info already out there.  One important note:  If you set up the Alexa app on your phone, IT WILL IMPORT ALL OF YOUR PHONE CONTACTS. I didn't think I gave it permission to do so but Alexa did indeed import my contacts!  You may have read stories how, WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE, Alexa can record what's being said in your home and then send it to ANY or ALL of those contacts! Yikes!  And, I won't want any of my kids to accidentally send messages to or call people on my contact list. So, if you want to keep your contacts from Alexa and prevent that from happening here's how I did it:Before installiing the Alexa app on your phone, export your contacts to a file and save it for later. Then, go back to the phone and delete those contacts (don't worry, you'll import them back in later).  Now, install the Alexa app on your phone and go through the set up process. At some point, you'll have the option to allow Alexa to automatically import any additions to your contacts.  Please ""disable"" that option.  After you're done with the installation, you'll notice there are no contacts in your Alexa app!  Now, you can import your contacts back into your phonebook using the file that you initially created and you're good to go!If you already installed the app but want to delete your contacts from Alexa, it's not too late.  Simply export your phone contacts to a file and save for later.  Then, delete the contacts from your phone.  Now, open the Alexa app and click ""Contacts.""  On the Contacts page, click on ""Import Contacts"" and enable it by moving the button to the right side.  This will cause Alexa to replace your existing contacts with the now empty phonebook.  After a few minutes, your Alexa contacts will be gone.  Go back and disable ""Import Contacts"" to prevent Alexa from importing them in the future.  You can now import the contact file that you created back into your phone.Of course there may be some contacts you do want to use with Alexa.  I simply added them manually by clicking ""Add Contact.""I hope this info is helpful as I wasn't able to find an easy way to manage Alexa contacts.
",0.7345049982,electronics,"I've been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a year now, and I was glad to add this to the arsenal.  After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!).  I will start by summarizing what's new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I'll describe the device in more detail, and finally I'll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you.The most obvious update to the Dot is the new look: it's as if someone took a 2nd generation Dot, inflated it with an air pump, and wrapped the edge in fabric.  And it's not bad!What's different/updated in the 3rd Generation Dot:1) It is slightly larger than the 2nd generation device, measuring 3.9"" wide x 1.7"" tall (2nd gen was 3.3"" wide x 1.3"" tall), and the top and bottom edges are more rounded.  It is also substantially heavier at nearly twice the weight of the 2nd generation model.2) The 2nd generation Dot came in two color options (black and white), each of which had a shiny plastic exterior that I personally thought looked a little cheap.  The 3rd generation Dot has a fabric exterior which gives it a classier appearance, and it's available in three colors: heather grey, sandstone, and charcoal.  The fabric and rounded edges give the 3rd generation Dot a much softer look than its predecessor.4) The 3rd generation Dot has a larger speaker (1.6"", versus 1.1"" on the 2nd gen), which is paired with a larger driver as well.  I'll talk below about the effect this has on audio quality.5) The placement of the microphones is slightly different: while the 2nd generation had seven small far-field microphones on its top surface; the 3rd generation has four microphones.---------------------------Overall appearance---------------------------I purchased the ""sandstone"" version. The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades which gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray. The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives the unit a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don't want something that screams ""I'm a device!""Aside from its larger size and slight convex bulge, the top of the device is nearly identical to that of the 2nd generation Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an ""action"" button) and a multi-colored light ring around the top edge that tells you about the Echo's status.  The side of the device has an input for the power cable and a 3.5-mm output jack.One notable improvement is the shape of the power cable, which sits flatter against the wall than the 2nd generation Dot's cable (see my photo to see them side by side).  This may sound like an insignificant change, but it makes a huge difference if you want to plug the cable into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.-------------Setup-------------Setting up the Dot couldn't be easier.  You simply plug in the power cable, then use the Alexa app on your phone to connect the Dot to your WiFi network.  The app leads you through everything, and the whole process takes less than a minute.  Boom.----------------Audio----------------I did a side-by-side audio comparison of the 2nd and 3rd Generation Echo Dots, first with music (orchestral, a jazz combo, and some AC/DC) and then with a few newscasts.  Everything does sound better on the 3rd generation Dot, but to be honest, the sound is still pretty anemic.  Compared with the 2nd generation Dot, the sound is slightly fuller, not as annoyingly tinny, and has a small amount of bass presence (not much, but the 2nd generation had none).  Newscasts and other spoken texts benefit from the fuller sound as well, but the difference is more pronounced with music.  Just for fun, I also compared the 3rd generation Dot with my 2nd generation Echo, and THAT'S where I noticed a big difference.  Yes, the new Dot sounds a bit better than its predecessor, but they both sound weak compared to the full-sized Echo.  (To its credit, Amazon doesn't claim that the Dot has room-filling sound.)I'll be blunt: I really like the Dot, but I don't use it to listen to music.  At all.  With so many other speaker options out there, there's just no reason to use this as your primary music device.-------------------------Voice recognition-------------------------As I mentioned above, the number of microphones on the top surface has dropped from seven to four.  I'm not sure what the rationale for this was, but after testing the Dot's ability to pick up my voice from different distances and angles, I didn't notice a substantial difference in the overall microphone sensitivity compared to the 2nd generation Dot.  Like the other Echo devices, though, it seems to have more difficulty detecting voices that come from below it (which happens if I talk to it while I'm on the floor playing with my daughter).-------------------Functionality-------------------The bottom line is that the overall functionality -- what the 3rd generation Dot ""does"" -- is nearly identical to that of the previous generations (and of other Echo devices, or at least the ones without screens).  This is largely because the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon's cloud, not your individual device.  This means that as Amazon adds new features and updates to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices.  So, you can use any of them to:- Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources- Control smart home devices with your voice- Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America- Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account- Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.- Do anything else in Alexa's ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future.If you don't want to use the Dot's built-in speaker, you can connect it to your own speakers via Bluetooth or by using the 3.5-mm output jack.One new feature for the 3rd generation Dot is a little puzzling to me: You can pair two Echo Dots in a ""stereo mode,"" giving you essentially left and right speakers.  I tried this briefly and the results were pretty much what I expected: yes, it's stereo, but it's still weak sound!  You can also pair an Echo Sub with the Dots, creating a little 2.1 sound system.  Frankly, I'm not sure why you would do this; if I were setting up for stereo sound, I would want speakers that are designed for decent audio performance, not two Echo Dots.Alexa's skill set is enormous and always growing.  In fact, part of the fun of owning an Echo device is seeing what new skills Amazon comes up with (even if many new skills are just silly or entertaining).  I'll mention two of my favorite skills here: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature. The flash briefing is fully customizable daily digest of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking ""What's my flash briefing?"" There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining. Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it. For example, I configured mine with news feeds from NPR, BBC, and Reuters. I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.My other favorite feature, ""drop in,"" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom. Simply ask Alexa to ""drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]"" and you are instantly connected. My wife and I use this feature to communicate from opposite ends of the house. You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature. Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number. Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate. By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established. For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!]-----------------------------------A few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------Unfortunately this 3rd Generation Dot shares an annoying trait of its predecessors: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing. As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as BBC News) come through quietly while others (like Reuters) are much louder.  Not a deal-breaker, but slightly annoying.Also, occasionally when Alexa misunderstands a command, you have to ""start over,"" which can be really irritating.  For example, if Alexa thinks you asked to turn on a light but you really asked something else, she will repeatedly say ""In which room?"" until you say ""Alexa, stop"" and then start over.  I'm guessing this type of thing will improve over time as voice recognition software  becomes more advanced.  This is really more of an Alexa issue than a Dot issue, but it drives me nuts at times.Finally, I wish the Alexa phone app was easier to use.  It works, but its organization is not intuitive and it feels rather clunky to navigate.  Again, this is more of an ""Alexa"" issue than a ""Dot"" issue, but still... Hopefully Amazon will continue to make improvements to it!--------------A few tips--------------1) The Dot seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits). Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don't recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent). If you add too many feeds you'll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms). One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to ""Echo"" or ""Amazon."" The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!------------------------------------------------------------------------Echo Dot vs. Echo vs. Echo Plus: Which one to buy?------------------------------------------------------------------------(Please note that I am only comparing Echo devices that do NOT have screens.)When choosing between the Echo Dot and one of the larger Echo devices, perhaps the most important question to ask is ""How much do you plan to LISTEN to the device?""  This question is important because one of the biggest differences between the Echo Dot and the larger Echo devices is sound quality: the 1.6"" speaker of the Dot simply cannot match the fullness and heft of the Echo or Echo Plus.  (Remember, they all run on the same Alexa software, which means they all have nearly identical skill sets!)So, if you don't currently own an Echo device, start by thinking carefully about how you plan to use it.  Many Alexa skills fall into one of two broad categories: those that rely heavily on the speaker and those that don't.  For example, features that benefit from good sound quality include playing music/newscasts/podcasts, the drop-in feature, and hands-free calling.  (This is why I chose an Echo Plus for my kitchen - I use it every morning to listen to the news.)  If you plan to use your device largely for these type of features, you would probably appreciate the better sound of the Echo or Echo Plus.On the other hand, if plan to use the Echo mainly for ""non-listening"" purposes such as voice-controlling your smart home devices, then the sound quality isn't as important and a Dot is probably all you need.  In fact, you could even save some money by purchasing a 2nd generation Dot instead -- especially if it's not going to be in a highly visible location or you don't mind its shiny plastic look.  I have several ""single-purpose"" Dots in my house in rooms where I want to voice-control one thing, such as a lamp in the room, and 2nd generations Dots are just fine for this -- and now that their price has gone down they are a great value!==========Bottom line==========The Echo Dot is an extraordinarily useful and versatile device -- one that becomes more useful all the time as Alexa's skill set expands.  The 3rd Generation model has a great new look, but despite marginal improvements in the speaker, it's still pretty unsatisfying as a playback device for music or  newscasts.  As long as you are willing to accept its acoustic limitations, the Dot can be a wonderful device to have in your home.  And if you DO want better sound quality for the features you use most often, you can always connect the Dot to your own sound system via Bluetooth or the 3.5-mm audio jack.  Hope this was helpful!
",0.52,electronics," I cannot say enough about this amazon echo dot. It is WONDERFUL. Loud, crisp, and knows my voice so well. I love the size of this one. It is much more convenient and easy to stow away but still be heard with the far field of sound. My guests have absolutely enjoyed asking questions and about the weather and especially using it with my Spotify. I purchased a wall mount too that works very well. Again I would recommend this to anyone who loves to have music around the house being played. Did I mention the price? Unbeatable. Don’t get a knock off! Just get the amazon echo dot 3rd generation and do yourself a favor. I am just over the moon about this item. Thanks amazon!EDIT - After two months using I am so satisfied with my proud bird wall mount! It fits my echo dot perfectly! I have already bought another!
",0.9837943322,electronics,"I had no idea I'd love Alexa so much - I wake up in the morning and she does the routine I've set up, and she's so comforting and useful and fun overall.  My husband and I played Skills trivia games for hours last night.  If we had kids it would be even more super useful (kids workouts, stories, games) - we even had a goodnight story read to us by Alexa and it was awesome.  I'm really loving it.  The Echo Dot itself is pretty great - the sound quality is pretty good, the bass when turned up is not that great, but if you really want to rock out you can connect it to other speakers or just use something else instead.  I'm really surprised by how much I like the Alexa app (and the Echo Dot), because I'm a little resistant to technology, but it's pretty easy to figure out and feels like a new little buddy in the home.  I'm excited to get some SmartHome stuff now so I can turn on/off lights, heat, etc.  The only tiny issue I have is that for some reason Alexa doesn't pick up my husband's voice as much as it does mine - maybe because I've used it more?  Really cool, though, overall - I feel like Judy Jetson!
",0.9750604632,electronics,"I was excited when they said it had a better speaker as the echo dot's are disappointingly quiet. Meanwhile the google home mini of the same size is VERY loud and crisp. This new version the 3.0...is somewhere in the middle. A little louder but not quite enough. I was hoping to have one in the kitchen and have it play my audio books while i clean/cook, but its still difficult to hear ti clearly over the kitchen activity. No such problem with the google home mini. Also a downside, they changed the charge port to an old fashioned pin style instead of the micro USB. This limits the places I can use it I have a small powered hub in the living room I connect my devices too and I was going to get another one of these for that, but I won't now since I can't connect it easily where I want to.  I also used to bring one onto the back patio and have it powered by my Anker usb battery, but I can't do that with this one anymore. Not sure why they suddenly abandoned the micro usb style. It can easily meet the 15 watt demand the 3.0 requires.Also if you need/want a wall mount for this version, you can get one to print on thingiverse.UPDATE:Within a few minutes of leaving this review I got multiple calls from Amazon asking me to explain my review....not offering to take it back or to exchange it or solve anything for me...but asking me to explain myself.  The girl by the end of the call seemed nice enough, but the fact that within a few minutes of a review I got multiple calls on my personal cell asking me to ""explain myself"" seems almost like they're trying to intimidate you away from giving an honest review.  Especially since I think I gave all the relevant details in my review.  Afterwards I was kind of thinking...is this like a modern ""mafia thing? Are my orders going to arrived busted up or just go missing now?
",0.1406458022,electronics,"I have 5 Echo Dots (gen 2) and we use them throughout the house for just about everything, being we have a fairly smart home. What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.Enter the Gen 3...I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.That is before you get to the horrendous power cord and adapter. The power adapter is twice as big as the gen 2 and the power cord went away from the, easy to find, usb style cord to a old style input style and it is permanently attached to the power adapter. This is really my biggest complaint as it took away so much flexibility, that you could enjoy with the gen 2. Don't get me wrong, I am sure there will be several new cords and adapters put out to fill the gap, but that is not as easy as using cords many already have. Just makes no sense. Not to mention the cord is really long, so in areas where you want it to be a bit more discreet, this thing sticks out like a sore thumb.What I like...Sound Quality is a step upSound Volume is much improvedBase look is much improvedWhat I dislike...Much less flexibility on how it is used versus previous versionNon-standard power cordBulky adapterUgly long cord
",0.9171458482,electronics,"I'm forced to use the online Alexa app because I don't own any Apple or Android device and my Windows 10 PC doesn't have the app. I'll list just a few of the problems I've had:1) It often fails to understand what I say. 2) It often fails to respond to my voice at all, though it's only two or three feet away. It responds to dead silence just as often as to my voice commands. 3) Many commands are not executed. For example, it will not make adjustments to the audio equalizer; it will not give my daily briefing items; it will not play stations saved to my iHeart favorites. 4) There's no product support. I've sent a number of email requests to support and received no response. 5) I had a bunch of recurring reminders set up, and they worked for a couple of days. Suddenly they all vanished. These were important work-related reminders. Of course, there's no way to back them up or save them. So, they're simply gone. 6) The audio quality is poor and sounds muffled no matter what I do.

",0.8992954493,electronics,"Sound quality is the best I've heard on a speaker of this size!!!  Definitely worth paying a little extra for this one over the 2nd generation model.  I'm not going to discuss the functionality as there's tons of info already out there.  One important note:  If you set up the Alexa app on your phone, IT WILL IMPORT ALL OF YOUR PHONE CONTACTS. I didn't think I gave it permission to do so but Alexa did indeed import my contacts!  You may have read stories how, WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE, Alexa can record what's being said in your home and then send it to ANY or ALL of those contacts! Yikes!  And, I won't want any of my kids to accidentally send messages to or call people on my contact list. So, if you want to keep your contacts from Alexa and prevent that from happening here's how I did it:Before installiing the Alexa app on your phone, export your contacts to a file and save it for later. Then, go back to the phone and delete those contacts (don't worry, you'll import them back in later).  Now, install the Alexa app on your phone and go through the set up process. At some point, you'll have the option to allow Alexa to automatically import any additions to your contacts.  Please ""disable"" that option.  After you're done with the installation, you'll notice there are no contacts in your Alexa app!  Now, you can import your contacts back into your phonebook using the file that you initially created and you're good to go!If you already installed the app but want to delete your contacts from Alexa, it's not too late.  Simply export your phone contacts to a file and save for later.  Then, delete the contacts from your phone.  Now, open the Alexa app and click ""Contacts.""  On the Contacts page, click on ""Import Contacts"" and enable it by moving the button to the right side.  This will cause Alexa to replace your existing contacts with the now empty phonebook.  After a few minutes, your Alexa contacts will be gone.  Go back and disable ""Import Contacts"" to prevent Alexa from importing them in the future.  You can now import the contact file that you created back into your phone.Of course there may be some contacts you do want to use with Alexa.  I simply added them manually by clicking ""Add Contact.""I hope this info is helpful as I wasn't able to find an easy way to manage Alexa contacts.
",0.7345049983,electronics,"I've been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a year now, and I was glad to add this to the arsenal.  After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!).  I will start by summarizing what's new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I'll describe the device in more detail, and finally I'll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you.The most obvious update to the Dot is the new look: it's as if someone took a 2nd generation Dot, inflated it with an air pump, and wrapped the edge in fabric.  And it's not bad!What's different/updated in the 3rd Generation Dot:1) It is slightly larger than the 2nd generation device, measuring 3.9"" wide x 1.7"" tall (2nd gen was 3.3"" wide x 1.3"" tall), and the top and bottom edges are more rounded.  It is also substantially heavier at nearly twice the weight of the 2nd generation model.2) The 2nd generation Dot came in two color options (black and white), each of which had a shiny plastic exterior that I personally thought looked a little cheap.  The 3rd generation Dot has a fabric exterior which gives it a classier appearance, and it's available in three colors: heather grey, sandstone, and charcoal.  The fabric and rounded edges give the 3rd generation Dot a much softer look than its predecessor.4) The 3rd generation Dot has a larger speaker (1.6"", versus 1.1"" on the 2nd gen), which is paired with a larger driver as well.  I'll talk below about the effect this has on audio quality.5) The placement of the microphones is slightly different: while the 2nd generation had seven small far-field microphones on its top surface; the 3rd generation has four microphones.---------------------------Overall appearance---------------------------I purchased the ""sandstone"" version. The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades which gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray. The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives the unit a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don't want something that screams ""I'm a device!""Aside from its larger size and slight convex bulge, the top of the device is nearly identical to that of the 2nd generation Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an ""action"" button) and a multi-colored light ring around the top edge that tells you about the Echo's status.  The side of the device has an input for the power cable and a 3.5-mm output jack.One notable improvement is the shape of the power cable, which sits flatter against the wall than the 2nd generation Dot's cable (see my photo to see them side by side).  This may sound like an insignificant change, but it makes a huge difference if you want to plug the cable into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.-------------Setup-------------Setting up the Dot couldn't be easier.  You simply plug in the power cable, then use the Alexa app on your phone to connect the Dot to your WiFi network.  The app leads you through everything, and the whole process takes less than a minute.  Boom.----------------Audio----------------I did a side-by-side audio comparison of the 2nd and 3rd Generation Echo Dots, first with music (orchestral, a jazz combo, and some AC/DC) and then with a few newscasts.  Everything does sound better on the 3rd generation Dot, but to be honest, the sound is still pretty anemic.  Compared with the 2nd generation Dot, the sound is slightly fuller, not as annoyingly tinny, and has a small amount of bass presence (not much, but the 2nd generation had none).  Newscasts and other spoken texts benefit from the fuller sound as well, but the difference is more pronounced with music.  Just for fun, I also compared the 3rd generation Dot with my 2nd generation Echo, and THAT'S where I noticed a big difference.  Yes, the new Dot sounds a bit better than its predecessor, but they both sound weak compared to the full-sized Echo.  (To its credit, Amazon doesn't claim that the Dot has room-filling sound.)I'll be blunt: I really like the Dot, but I don't use it to listen to music.  At all.  With so many other speaker options out there, there's just no reason to use this as your primary music device.-------------------------Voice recognition-------------------------As I mentioned above, the number of microphones on the top surface has dropped from seven to four.  I'm not sure what the rationale for this was, but after testing the Dot's ability to pick up my voice from different distances and angles, I didn't notice a substantial difference in the overall microphone sensitivity compared to the 2nd generation Dot.  Like the other Echo devices, though, it seems to have more difficulty detecting voices that come from below it (which happens if I talk to it while I'm on the floor playing with my daughter).-------------------Functionality-------------------The bottom line is that the overall functionality -- what the 3rd generation Dot ""does"" -- is nearly identical to that of the previous generations (and of other Echo devices, or at least the ones without screens).  This is largely because the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon's cloud, not your individual device.  This means that as Amazon adds new features and updates to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices.  So, you can use any of them to:- Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources- Control smart home devices with your voice- Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America- Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account- Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.- Do anything else in Alexa's ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future.If you don't want to use the Dot's built-in speaker, you can connect it to your own speakers via Bluetooth or by using the 3.5-mm output jack.One new feature for the 3rd generation Dot is a little puzzling to me: You can pair two Echo Dots in a ""stereo mode,"" giving you essentially left and right speakers.  I tried this briefly and the results were pretty much what I expected: yes, it's stereo, but it's still weak sound!  You can also pair an Echo Sub with the Dots, creating a little 2.1 sound system.  Frankly, I'm not sure why you would do this; if I were setting up for stereo sound, I would want speakers that are designed for decent audio performance, not two Echo Dots.Alexa's skill set is enormous and always growing.  In fact, part of the fun of owning an Echo device is seeing what new skills Amazon comes up with (even if many new skills are just silly or entertaining).  I'll mention two of my favorite skills here: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature. The flash briefing is fully customizable daily digest of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking ""What's my flash briefing?"" There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining. Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it. For example, I configured mine with news feeds from NPR, BBC, and Reuters. I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.My other favorite feature, ""drop in,"" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom. Simply ask Alexa to ""drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]"" and you are instantly connected. My wife and I use this feature to communicate from opposite ends of the house. You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature. Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number. Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate. By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established. For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!]-----------------------------------A few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------Unfortunately this 3rd Generation Dot shares an annoying trait of its predecessors: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing. As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as BBC News) come through quietly while others (like Reuters) are much louder.  Not a deal-breaker, but slightly annoying.Also, occasionally when Alexa misunderstands a command, you have to ""start over,"" which can be really irritating.  For example, if Alexa thinks you asked to turn on a light but you really asked something else, she will repeatedly say ""In which room?"" until you say ""Alexa, stop"" and then start over.  I'm guessing this type of thing will improve over time as voice recognition software  becomes more advanced.  This is really more of an Alexa issue than a Dot issue, but it drives me nuts at times.Finally, I wish the Alexa phone app was easier to use.  It works, but its organization is not intuitive and it feels rather clunky to navigate.  Again, this is more of an ""Alexa"" issue than a ""Dot"" issue, but still... Hopefully Amazon will continue to make improvements to it!--------------A few tips--------------1) The Dot seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits). Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don't recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent). If you add too many feeds you'll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms). One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to ""Echo"" or ""Amazon."" The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!------------------------------------------------------------------------Echo Dot vs. Echo vs. Echo Plus: Which one to buy?------------------------------------------------------------------------(Please note that I am only comparing Echo devices that do NOT have screens.)When choosing between the Echo Dot and one of the larger Echo devices, perhaps the most important question to ask is ""How much do you plan to LISTEN to the device?""  This question is important because one of the biggest differences between the Echo Dot and the larger Echo devices is sound quality: the 1.6"" speaker of the Dot simply cannot match the fullness and heft of the Echo or Echo Plus.  (Remember, they all run on the same Alexa software, which means they all have nearly identical skill sets!)So, if you don't currently own an Echo device, start by thinking carefully about how you plan to use it.  Many Alexa skills fall into one of two broad categories: those that rely heavily on the speaker and those that don't.  For example, features that benefit from good sound quality include playing music/newscasts/podcasts, the drop-in feature, and hands-free calling.  (This is why I chose an Echo Plus for my kitchen - I use it every morning to listen to the news.)  If you plan to use your device largely for these type of features, you would probably appreciate the better sound of the Echo or Echo Plus.On the other hand, if plan to use the Echo mainly for ""non-listening"" purposes such as voice-controlling your smart home devices, then the sound quality isn't as important and a Dot is probably all you need.  In fact, you could even save some money by purchasing a 2nd generation Dot instead -- especially if it's not going to be in a highly visible location or you don't mind its shiny plastic look.  I have several ""single-purpose"" Dots in my house in rooms where I want to voice-control one thing, such as a lamp in the room, and 2nd generations Dots are just fine for this -- and now that their price has gone down they are a great value!==========Bottom line==========The Echo Dot is an extraordinarily useful and versatile device -- one that becomes more useful all the time as Alexa's skill set expands.  The 3rd Generation model has a great new look, but despite marginal improvements in the speaker, it's still pretty unsatisfying as a playback device for music or  newscasts.  As long as you are willing to accept its acoustic limitations, the Dot can be a wonderful device to have in your home.  And if you DO want better sound quality for the features you use most often, you can always connect the Dot to your own sound system via Bluetooth or the 3.5-mm audio jack.  Hope this was helpful!
",0.53,electronics," I cannot say enough about this amazon echo dot. It is WONDERFUL. Loud, crisp, and knows my voice so well. I love the size of this one. It is much more convenient and easy to stow away but still be heard with the far field of sound. My guests have absolutely enjoyed asking questions and about the weather and especially using it with my Spotify. I purchased a wall mount too that works very well. Again I would recommend this to anyone who loves to have music around the house being played. Did I mention the price? Unbeatable. Don’t get a knock off! Just get the amazon echo dot 3rd generation and do yourself a favor. I am just over the moon about this item. Thanks amazon!EDIT - After two months using I am so satisfied with my proud bird wall mount! It fits my echo dot perfectly! I have already bought another!
",0.9837943323,electronics,"I had no idea I'd love Alexa so much - I wake up in the morning and she does the routine I've set up, and she's so comforting and useful and fun overall.  My husband and I played Skills trivia games for hours last night.  If we had kids it would be even more super useful (kids workouts, stories, games) - we even had a goodnight story read to us by Alexa and it was awesome.  I'm really loving it.  The Echo Dot itself is pretty great - the sound quality is pretty good, the bass when turned up is not that great, but if you really want to rock out you can connect it to other speakers or just use something else instead.  I'm really surprised by how much I like the Alexa app (and the Echo Dot), because I'm a little resistant to technology, but it's pretty easy to figure out and feels like a new little buddy in the home.  I'm excited to get some SmartHome stuff now so I can turn on/off lights, heat, etc.  The only tiny issue I have is that for some reason Alexa doesn't pick up my husband's voice as much as it does mine - maybe because I've used it more?  Really cool, though, overall - I feel like Judy Jetson!
",0.9750604633,electronics,"I was excited when they said it had a better speaker as the echo dot's are disappointingly quiet. Meanwhile the google home mini of the same size is VERY loud and crisp. This new version the 3.0...is somewhere in the middle. A little louder but not quite enough. I was hoping to have one in the kitchen and have it play my audio books while i clean/cook, but its still difficult to hear ti clearly over the kitchen activity. No such problem with the google home mini. Also a downside, they changed the charge port to an old fashioned pin style instead of the micro USB. This limits the places I can use it I have a small powered hub in the living room I connect my devices too and I was going to get another one of these for that, but I won't now since I can't connect it easily where I want to.  I also used to bring one onto the back patio and have it powered by my Anker usb battery, but I can't do that with this one anymore. Not sure why they suddenly abandoned the micro usb style. It can easily meet the 15 watt demand the 3.0 requires.Also if you need/want a wall mount for this version, you can get one to print on thingiverse.UPDATE:Within a few minutes of leaving this review I got multiple calls from Amazon asking me to explain my review....not offering to take it back or to exchange it or solve anything for me...but asking me to explain myself.  The girl by the end of the call seemed nice enough, but the fact that within a few minutes of a review I got multiple calls on my personal cell asking me to ""explain myself"" seems almost like they're trying to intimidate you away from giving an honest review.  Especially since I think I gave all the relevant details in my review.  Afterwards I was kind of thinking...is this like a modern ""mafia thing? Are my orders going to arrived busted up or just go missing now?
",0.1406458023,electronics,"I have 5 Echo Dots (gen 2) and we use them throughout the house for just about everything, being we have a fairly smart home. What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.Enter the Gen 3...I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.That is before you get to the horrendous power cord and adapter. The power adapter is twice as big as the gen 2 and the power cord went away from the, easy to find, usb style cord to a old style input style and it is permanently attached to the power adapter. This is really my biggest complaint as it took away so much flexibility, that you could enjoy with the gen 2. Don't get me wrong, I am sure there will be several new cords and adapters put out to fill the gap, but that is not as easy as using cords many already have. Just makes no sense. Not to mention the cord is really long, so in areas where you want it to be a bit more discreet, this thing sticks out like a sore thumb.What I like...Sound Quality is a step upSound Volume is much improvedBase look is much improvedWhat I dislike...Much less flexibility on how it is used versus previous versionNon-standard power cordBulky adapterUgly long cord

",0.7653418784,electronics,"Over and over, in the ""most helpful"" reviews, I read about ""ads"" displaying. This does NOT ever display ads, it displays Alexa skills and things to try with your device. I read that people cannot get that to stop happening. It's right in the settings: go to: ---Home & Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Discovery---, that will end the Alexa skills displaying (may cycle once after setting but then they're gone for good). I kept reading that people who want to use it as a clock were upset that the clock kept getting minimized (to left corner) to show other things. That's because, yet again, they aren't setting it up correctly. So, in the settings: go to: ---Home & Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Rotate Continuously---, that will make the Home screen always display a full screen clock. You can also just turn off any content in that list. Note that each time you go into the settings, immediately after, it WILL show you a single skill or any content you left on. But that's it. It will just be a clock from then on, until you interact with it again and then it may display a single skill or that content. Once. Then back to being a full time clock.Full disclosure: I got this to use as an alarm clock and not as a primary viewing assistant. For that, I recommend the larger echo devices. I also got this on Prime Day for $50 (rather than $90). That's a screaming good deal for what is basically a voice activated, smart alarm clock with a lot of different options.Decent Alarm clocks run $30-50 anyways so I thought I'd give this device a try for $50. I should have bought 2. Even for $90, I feel like this is a great device but if you wait, it will eventually go on sale again. I don't intend to use it to watch TV shows or movies, I have TVs, tablets and PCs for that. I saw people mentioning being disappointed in the resolution or screen quality. I don't see the problem. This certainly isn't going to compare to your $300-800 smart phone screen but it's not bad looking when playing videos or displaying the clock. It's similar to say, an iPhone 3 or Galaxy S2. I feel like the people complaining are expecting ""the moon"" for the money this costs. It's $90. Not $150 or $200.There was alot of fairly bad reviews on the echo 5, but I wanted something bigger that I could use to see my ring doorbell video.  Setup was easy and got it running no problem.  Tried ""alexa show me the front door""... and nothing worked!!  No panic, went and pushed the ring doorbell and checked my phone, live video seen no problem.  OK, try Echo again ""alexa show my the front door""  Bingo!!  video displayed in about 3 sec's (i'd seen comments it was taking over 11 seconds) but that's not what I experienced.Next sound quality, tried a few songs... Wow I was not expecting much in the audio quality, but it was actually really good and as a side benefit, it displays the words of the song as it's sang, pretty cool.  Basically all the other alexa functions work as with any device, but now you also get video feedback. Ask about the weather,  get your info, plus it displays the  temp, clouds, sun, whatever...  Very happy with purchase and highly recommended!!
",0.9454102524,electronics,"I really do enjoy this device and am impressed at the abilities of Alexa. That said, until they add the option to disable the “Try Alexa” suggestions on the bottom of the home screen I can’t recommend it and will not be buying addition units.Looking online I am far from the only person driven crazy by this so I hope Amazon listens to the feedback and makes this possible in a future update.
",0.7647724154,electronics,"I received my new Echo Show 8 - HD 8"" smart display with Alexa a couple hours ago. I had it unpacked and connected to my WIFI within 30 minutes. I have 3 Ring cameras, front door bell, a front & back yard motion light cameras. Once I followed the steps to add Ring in the Alexa app, like 2 minutes, It was so intuitive I don't know what I did right but another 5 minutes I said Alexa show front door and she said okay and there was my front door camera on the screen. Then I said Alexa, show back which is what I named the devise ""back"" and she said okay and showed the back yard camera, same with the front successfully. I have many more smart devices the Alexa app found on my wi-fi so I'm excited to figure out how to add them.Also, now I understand the importance of naming the devices. Alexa only understands exactly what you name them in the devise list for voice commands.

I ESPECIALLY like the ability to customize the clock.I received the new Echo Show 8 as a gift this past weekend and like it for most of the same reasons I like the Echo Show 5: great connectivity; good diversity of content and skills; and great as a sound speaker and photo display.But I found that the ES8 does not have the same options for clock faces as the ES5. There is no apparent reason for this, nor is it highlighted in the marketing for the ES8. Amazon, please update the ES8 software to permit at least the same range of clockfaces as the ES5.

They constantly scroll overtop of the pictures  and photos that you upload to the home screen and wallpaper, making them really hard to ignore.  And the clock is so small in the upper left corner, that you have to be right on top of it to read it.  I couldn't take it any more and had to return my new Echo Show 8.

But the difference is not too crazy.The screen resolution is almost the same. It looks very good.The sound is very solid in the echo show 8.I think the 8 is a compressed version on the 10 inch version. But that doesn't mean it's not good.Overall, I would definitely consider getting this over the 10 inch model. The price difference justifies it.

Do not google the set up website - type in the address as it is when prompted on the screen and you will be fine.
",0.9177898765,electronics,"I finally decided to buy one to help keep my TV relevant. Most of the apps from my 2011 model TV don't work anymore and was limited in functionality. I wish I bought one of these years ago though. Now, reading through previous comments, there is someone who gave 2 stars and complained about being single banded WiFi. This guy doesn't pay attention to what hes looking at. Yes, this is clearly stated that it only uses 2.4GHz band. No, they didn't go backwards in any form with this. With a quick search, and all Roku Expresses, which is what this is, have been single band. And 2.4GHz is fine when only going 1080p for HD.Now about using it. Setting everything up doesn't take long, around 10-15 minutes. Once you have it set up, it's eay to use to get on Netflix, or Amazon Prime to watch your favorite shows. You can also download some other apps to get some free TV to you flip through another couple hundred channels and complain about there is nothing to watch, because we all know we do that. When watching something, the picture does take a minute to download, buffer, and catch up, so the first little bit may be a bit blurry, but it evens out. There is also the Roku app for your phone, and this adds some ease of use. Instead of using the remote to attempt to hit the sensor on the device, you can connect to the Roku on your phone as long as they are on the same WiFi network.If you want to stream easier on your TV, or your TV doesn't have the Smart features you want, I would recommend this. If you want 4K video, then you need to look at something else because this doesn't off it. Also, if you really need to use 5GHz WiFi, then also, look elsewhere. Now, I can't compare this to other models, but this works well for what I wanted it for. Would recommend.
",0.8023483755,electronics,"Why have they gone backwards from a few years ago and are producing new devices (this is not the first so be  careful) that support only the oldest 2.4 ghz wireless band.  They talk about high speed streaming needing a strong wifi network and internet connection but limit you to the slowest option on your modern router.  My Roku 2 second gen devices from 4 years ago do only support wireless N but they do so on both the 2.4 and 5.0 wireless bands.  This makes a big speed difference on any network but if you happen to live in a populated area it makes a HUGE difference.
",0.55,electronics,"I had to return it today though I only had it for 1 day or so. Reason: There's activation fee of $100, which was not specified on the webpage when I made the purchase. Based on the description on the webpage, I was under the impression that I just have to pay for the device & get all the free channels I want. It described that I only have to pay for the channels that were not free. However, when I finally got a chance to install the device on my TV & tried to activate it using the code on the TV screen, it told me that it failed. I called the support phone# & was told by someone with heavy accent who rudely rambled on & on about all kinds of benefits of activating the device WITHOUT giving me a chance to talk. After he was done advertising for his company's product, he finally said it would cost me $100 to create an account in order to activate it. He told me also before I hung up the phone that if I decide to pay to create an account, I'd have to call Monday (it was Saturday when I called). This might have been a good product, but the company should've made buyers aware upfront of the activation fee. In all, I was totally disappointed.
",0.0678085985,electronics,"Overall, was I eventually moderately satisfied. The initial setup was a breeze. However, I got a rude shock when the video from a lot of channels wouldn't stream - instead of video, I got only sound and error code 020. (Of note, I was trying to run our Roku through an HDMI signal switch.)As it turns out, a lot of HDMI signal switches/splitters sold on Amazon are NOT HDCP compatible. (HDCP is a form of digital copy protection; I only learned about this when trying to troubleshoot this Roku). A lot of channels available on the Roku use HDCP. So, as a result, content from those channels could not be streamed from the Roku to our TV through our HDMI switch/splitter. It took some Googling to figure this out - the Roku support article regarding HDCP error messages mostly discussed unplugging and replugging things, and turning things on and off again. It did not mention HDMI signal switch/splitter incompatibility. I would have been up and running more quickly, and ultimately more satisfied, if that had been the case.After figuring this out, I plugged the Roku directly into the TV, and it worked perfectly. Unfortunately, I had to rearrange all of our other HDMI inputs in order to do this.If you are reliant on HDMI switches/splitters, figure out if your switch is HDCP compatible before getting this incarnation of Roku.Also, it is advertised that the Roku mobile app has a keyboard function - on my iOS, the the mobile remote control functions that I've tried work, with the exception of the mobile keyboard. Hopefully a Google search will yield a fix, but I would be even more satisfied if this keyboard feature worked right out of the box.EDIT:The remote control stopped working after a month. It's a good thing there is a mobile Roku app. Otherwise, we'd have to order a new remote.
",0.2764065865,electronics,"I bought this Roku to expand into a fourth room, and I was happy to see that it was offered at a fraction of the cost of my other Roku models. Of course, this bare-boned unit asks for you to sacrifice some of the options on the more expensive units, such as a TV on/off button, volume control, and an earphone plug-in on the remote. All of these minor issues are easily solved by using both the Roku and the TV remotes or by employing the free Roku mobile app for iOS or Android.A major issue for some consumers might be the 2.4 GHz wireless connection. After several days of use, we have seen no issues. Streaming has been perfect, no lagging or interruptions, and load time seems no longer than any of the other Roku units we own.Installation was easy and there should be no hiccups for the majority of users. This was the first time that Roku asked me to sign up with a Google account, so it took the extra few minutes for me to set that up, but otherwise it was no harder than usual.If you are looking for a solid unit and a great price, you can't do better than this unit. Five stars.

I looked at them but they did not help.

Having a credit card is NOT needed for many of the features and content sites and they have obviously chosen to make it VERY frustrating for those users who would prefer not to give out their credit card information before choosing to make a first purchase. A simple ¨Skip this step for now¨ button  is all that they need. But they chose to hide that  feature and so they get a lousy review for having made their new device a pain to  use during set-up.

",0.8855198626,electronics,"*UPGRADES from Generation 1 to Generation 2:-added HDR10+ and Dolby Vision support-added Bluetooth 5.0 support (Gen1 was 4.2)-added Local Voice Control :  locally processes some frequently used voice commands, executing them faster - ie ""Alexa Go Home"" etc.-Fire OS 7.2.0.4-CPU upgrade:  Gen 1 : Amlogic s905z, Quad-core up to 1.5 GHz  Gen 2 : Amlogic S922z, Hexa-core (Quad-core at up to 2.2GHz + Dual-core at up to 1.9GHz)-GPU upgrade:  Gen 1 : Mali 450 MP3  Gen 2 : Mali G52-MP6, 800MHzUPGRADE OPINIONS:The CPU/GPU and Local Voice Control upgrades result in a pretty big difference in speed and responsiveness between Gen 1 and Gen 2.  All actions are executed right away.  This is the biggest noticeable difference between Gen 1 and Gen 2.  HDR10+ and Dolby Vision support are nice to have if you own a TV that supports these HD formats.  The BT5.0 should result in longer range for Bluetooth connected devices.  I find the difference in speed to be well worth the cost of a Gen 2, but that is probably personal preference.  To me, saving a second or two with every command, and having access to Vision and BT5.0 seemed worth it.If you are upgrading from FireTV Stick 4K, you are getting a faster processor, 16GB storage over the Stick's 8GB, and all of the Echo functionality.---------------OVERALLThe Good:-Setup is super easy.  About 10 - 15 minutes of downloading updates, then up and running!  There is a check box on the right side of this page here on Amazon that says ""Link to my Amazon account to simplify setup.""  This is usually checked by default, so when you purchase this FireTV Cube it will transfer settings like saved Wifi passwords from other Echo devices in your house.  This makes setup very fast and easy.  (You can uncheck this option though if you are buying this as a gift for someone else.)-FireTV Cube is great for controlling multiple devices. The ability to act as an IR blaster to control most TVs and soundbars; in addition to the regular Echo control of smart devices is very useful.  Not having to use an additional remote for the TV is great.-Some regular Echo interactions are much more useful when there is a visual component; like asking about the weather, or seeing song lyrics/album covers.-I like the abililty to use all of the newer Echo functions, like Drop-Ins/Calls, and multi room groups for music.  These were not available initially on the Gen 1 FireTV Cube.-Local Voice Control makes actions that used to take a over a second to complete almost instantaneous.The Bad:-No over-the-air HD antenna support (this is ""coming soon"")-Some apps have less voice control functionality than others.  Navagation for Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime were all pretty great; but technically some other apps might not support all of the voice commands, and you might have to use the remote.-No included HDMI cable.  This is minor, but I feel like it could've been included.TL,DR:Gen 2 is much faster than Gen 1, and has all the new Echo features.  Get it if you want a much faster Cube, or Dolby Vision/BT5.0 support.********FAQ- from some of the questions on this page:-Storage space: Specs say 16GB total.  Around 3GB must be used for the OS, because my storage details indicated 12.98 GB internal storage.  After installing Netflix and Youtube I had 11.15 GB of 12.98 GB available.-Controlling devices: The Cube has an IR blaster built in that acts a universal remote to send signals to most TVs and soundbars.  You can also use the IR extender attachment if you need to to reach other devices not in line of sight of the Cube.  Also in your Equipment Control settings, you can choose whether Mute, Volume Up/Down, and Power signals are sent from the Cube itself, or from the Cube's Alexa Remote.I will update this review as I test this device further!  For now it seems like a nice improvement over Gen 1, and a device that could be even more useful as the Echo environment is updated in the future.  If you have any specific questions, ask and I will test and respond as soon as I can.* (If you found this review to be informative and/or helpful, please click ""Helpful"" to let me know.

",0.9043095116,electronics,"Pros:• Plenty of choices for steaming 4k (make sure your TV can be built for that resolution). I mainly use Netflix, but you have Prime and thousands of more apps with this little guy. Have to admit it’s a pretty large library (that also has simple games to play).• My TV is built to play 4k, and I found no difference in quality if I put in a Blu-ray disk instead.• I’m getting a pretty immersive experience. 60 fps with HDR10 support and Dolby Atmosphere for audiophiles.• The Cube is pretty fast as well. The response time is very efficient when you’re asking simple questions/commands. I have to assume that because of the Cube software, it doesn’t need to rely on Amazon’s servers.• Have to give props on the microphone inside this machine. Even at the movie volume level, saying Alexa, will pick up your voice. I haven’t tested this out if you’re in a room full of loud people, but I assume you’ll get the same results.• I felt to have more use of using my voice than with a controller with this one. One example, I can tell Alexa which way to scroll and to open an app (Netflix for me) that I want to watch and Alexa follows that flawlessly. The voice recognition is more of a tool than a little side perk in this Cube.• It’s a smart home device, so you ask the Cube to turn on almost anything that is connected to a smart plugin. I found this great to use to just turn on the TV. No remote required.• The YouTube experience is also right on point. I’ve read that the past Fire TV Cubes from Amazon didn’t have a YouTube app. Well, this one does have it and it works without issue. I found this better if you already have a list of videos in your “Watch List” as searching will take time since you have no keyboard. What I do is I use my smartphone to quickly add the videos I want to my watch list and then refresh the YouTube page on the Cube. Simple and quick.• A very lively interface. It’s not complex and the simple guidelines it provides you make this ready to use right out of the box.• It does have an Ethernet adapter. I strongly recommend you use this. My Wi-Fi tends to disconnect at random times and an Ethernet connector prevents this from happening.• The remote that it comes with has a nice “clicky” touch and an excellent touchpad. The voice layout works well enough that I use the remote only to explore new apps on the Cube, or type.• When you start digging around with the Cube, some great features pop up. One is when you move your cursor over to a live channel (If you have “On Now”) it gives you a preview of what is happening on that channel. Similar to when you go on YouTube and move your move over to a video. Very efficient and something I had to make a pro for.• The setup took less than 3 minutes. The Cube identified my Samsung the moment it was connected.• If you have an Amazon Echo, then it’s exactly that but merged with a Fire TV Stick. This means, besides the simple weather questions, you can ask for directions to the closest restaurants and so forth. I live in a location where fast food restaurants are the lay of the land, but I can see this to be helpful for those who live deep in a city.• The microphone is set up in the Cube, and not the remote. You won’t have to worry if you lose the remote.• Amazon is not kidding. Ten of thousands of channels you can search through. I have to believe that Amazon has a channel for every person.Cons and Oks:• You don’t get an HDMI cable with this Cube. If you’re watching 4k, it would’ve been nice to have a high-quality HDMI cable with this purchase.• As I mention, big props with the voice layout, but you still got to use the remote as well. For more detail questions, Alexa will go off the rails as any question, other than simple dialogue, the Cube will need to check with the cloud for the answer. Example: I asked for the early 2000s movies starring Denzel Washington. It gave me movies like LOTR and The Prestige as the fifth and eighth results (lol).• The speakers are fine with Alexa’s voice but not fit to play music on. Stick to your TV speakers.• You can’t add storage in the Cube. What’s there is what’s there.• No USB-Stick connector. A huge lost because if you had a home video or a movie in a USB drive, you’re out of luck.• I can’t edit my home screen. I can’t customize it and it’s packed with ads, ads, and more ads.• The Ethernet adapter is placed on the Cube in an awkward place. It looks like that the designers forgot about this feature and design it within the last minute of production.• The ads on this device are extremely annoying. On the home screen, 25% of my viewing is a large ad of mostly Amazon shows.• With Netflix, I notice that you can ask Alexa to open the app, but if you have more than one account than Alexa will take you the account page. Because of this, I need to use the remote every time I want to use Alexa since the Cube can’t save my “specific” Netflix account.• You got to get used to “Alexa’s” vocabulary when speaking. Simple wordings like “Alexa, start over” are the style that you need to speak to experience good voice recognition.• I didn’t have the last Cube, but I’ve been told is the same design as before.• A huge dust and fingerprint magnet on the sides of the Cube.• When starting for the first time, there are numerous privacy contracts you need to agree to. I understand why, but there is a decent amount of “hit agree” buttons that for those who are not a fan of this.• Amazon can push a little too aggressively in promoting its Prime channels. I understand that you should expect more Amazon ads with this device, but you’re going to get a lot of them.• No voice password function available. Apple TV has this feature and I think I would make issues with apps like Netflix very efficient in accessing your account. The good news is that there is an app on the Cube that makes it easy to enter text using your remote.• I want to mention that not all content on this device is 4k. Many times I thought I was watching 4k but found out it was only HD. Now please note that if you don’t have a 4k TV then you’re not going to get the 4k experience. You need a 4k TV to enjoy the quality.Bottom Line:If you have the previous Fire TV Cube, than don’t waste your money on this. If you have only one media account that you use, then don’t waste your money on this. If you have a Fire TV Stick (even an Echo), than don’t waste your money one this.  But, if you have none of the issues above then this is a pretty good buy to have an Echo and a Fire TV Stick in one.With Apple TV and Roku, each is quite similar in what they offer. One reason I favor the Fire TV Cube is the number of apps and channels that are provided with this device (Plus 4k!). Also, I’m a huge fan of having a built-in Echo so you can begin to make your house a “smart house.”Still in the end this device isn’t a must have because it depends on you and your family on how much content you’re planning on watching. Apple TV will have different content than Roku, and Roku isn’t the same as the Cube. If you want to get into the world of digital media, I got to put my money on the Cube. Of all out systems out there, the Cube is more bang for your buck (Echo + Fire TV Stick + 1000+ apps/movies + 4k).Overall: A system built for those who want to jump in the digital media world, and the same old system for those who are already in it.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer
",0.8735712776,electronics,"This is a massive improvement over the 1st Gen cube!  Voice control is responsive and accurate, setup was pretty straight forward, and it works really well with my TV and AV equipment.  Netflix and Prime Video work well with both voice and remote control, I didn't have any trouble with 4k HDR or Dolby Vision stuff.  I was able to play some Dolby Atmos (DD+ streaming version) content over Prime Video.  Overall, this is an excellent box for a person who streams everything from online services!  The upgrades are welcome, anyone who was frustrated with the performance of the first gen Cube but intrigued by the functionality should probably give this one a chance!If you use Plex, Kodi or similar... the experience is less than desirable!  The box doesn't do passthrough for lossless codecs such as Dolby TrueHD, Dolby Atmos (non-DD+/lossless version) and DTS-MA.  Playing 4k content with any of that causes all sorts of issues while streaming.. including not playing at all, blank screens, or sever stuttering.  It's completely unacceptable that a streaming box capable of 4k, HDR/DV and Atmos isn't able to handle passthrough while the original Shield TV has been able to handle this for years!Also, the Ethernet to MicroUSB adapter is only 10/100Mbps.  This is sufficient for any online streaming and most all local streaming, but it's not unfeasible that a local 4k stream could be close to or slightly over 100Mbps.  While the included USB2.0 wouldn't allow for actual gigabit, there are suitable gigabit adapters that should allow ~400Mbps for wired.  There are adapters which are compatible, though it results in additional cost.  Considering the typical Cube user isn't likely to run in to any issues here, it's not really a miss.  Also, considering the above prevents a lot of this sort of content from being playable, the lack of USB3 or Gigabit is moot.I'd hoped this would be a replacement for my Shield TV (which doesn't support Dolby Vision), I was disappointed.  I'm also a bit annoyed, there's simply no logical reason for it not to support passthrough.Overall, I like the ability to come home and say ""Echo, open AT&T TV"" and have it open and playing CNN while I'm still getting settled... Or ""Echo, play the Good Place on Netflix"" and have the same.  But I don't like that this still requires me to switch back and forth between different devices depending on what I want to watch.  Hopefully Nvidia Shield will get Dolby Vision soon, and maybe Netflix will enable Dolby Atmos on the shield (or directly on my Vizio SmartCast TV.
",0.8011095526,electronics," TV boxes are difficult to review given the disparity between what general consumers want & need vs. enthusiasts looking for a home theater box. The Fire TV Cube is a good product for consumers who are heavily invested in the Amazon Alexa eco system but not for those looking for a lower cost alternative to an Nvidia Shield or home theater PC.The key advantage here is an Amazon Echo device that connects to your television. It is probably the best universal control device on the market currently, which means you can stop using through multiple remotes to shift from a Blu-ray player to a game console and just issue simple voice commands.It's impressive how it works even when there's a home theater receiver connected to the TV - after issuing a voice command it will tune to the input for the desired device. For things like Netflix that same voice command will also begin streaming the desired content. This could be very useful for households where the kids have a lot of stuff connected to the TV and you just want a simple way of watching Netflix.For streaming services it supports HDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision. Atmos sound also played successfully for shows that support it.Unfortunately all of the extra processing power in the Cube will go largely un-noticed and un-utilized by enthusiasts. I had trouble streaming my personal media from a Plex server. The box doesn't support lossless audio formats like DTS-HD and Dolby True HD. And 64 bit Android apps will not install (although 32 big versions do).So if you're an enthusiast the Nvidia Shield remains the best TV box four years later. This one is great for consumers looking for universal device control.
",0.9345568426,electronics,"I bought this to upgrade my previous version Cube.  It is easy to set up and much faster than the older version.One problem is that you can't clear the cache on your apps.  I have tried it from settings/apps and when you select it nothing happens.  This needs to be fixed.  I don't think you should have to uninstall and re-install your apps just to clear the cache.Another thing I have noticed on my Samsung 4K tv is that the picture gets darker.  If I go in to my TV settings I can reset it and maybe it is my tv but this never happened before I set up the new Cube.Update:  I forgot to note in my original review that I was really disappointed that this did not come with an HDMI cable.Update 10/18/19:  Amazon customer service was great and called me regarding the clear cache problem.

On top of that, James from customer service called me to let me know that the issue had been fixed! I was shocked. That's awesome customer service. I was really ready to take it back to Bestbuy and give it a shot at a later date. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is an issue with backing out of apps and menus. I didn't notice it at first; You can navigate forward through the different apps and menus, but when you go back through the menu it goes straight to the home screen. It wasn't until I went to the 4K firestick in the bedroom that I confirmed that something was wrong. Overall this is a good product. Very quick and responsive. Lightning fast start up and menu navigation. If they fix the issue with backing out of menus and apps, I will definitely give this 5 stars. One very pleased customer. Update: got home and there was another update. 5 stars! #teamamazon
",0.7967630626,electronics,"Update 2 (11/20/19): Yes I know.....since the last update the 2019 Shield Pro and Stick was released. I bought the Shield Pro immediately and went to test with Tivimate, iMPlayer, stbemu, etc etc and all worked flawlessly. However, the premium devices does come at a price difference. Shield stick is 149.99 and Pro is 199.99. The 3rd Gen Firetv Cube is only 119.99 and still a much better choice since its more bang for the buck. Disney+ looks amazing on this if you have Dolby Vision enabled TV. That's all for now. I'll come back in a year to give it a final review for its durability.Update 1 (10/20/19): So I noticed there was an update to the FireTV Cube couple days ago that fixed a small issue I had. The problem is sorta unique because I used the Logitech Harmony Hub/Remote to control everything. When I press ""Watch FireTV"" the hub would essentially powers on all my devices and set it all to the proper inputs. However, the TV is on but the screen is black. Nothing I could do to get the cube to display the homepage. I suspect it's the cube to tv issue. I then found out if I turn off the TV deep color mode (LG OLED) it would work. Now it works with the OLED deep color mode on and the colors pop even more. Ignore the ""purist"" and try the box out.I gave it a couple day of usage before writing the review. I bought the 1st Gen FireTV Cube several years back and it has been a wonderful device. It does have it upside and downside. But once I found out the 2nd Gen comes out I had to pre-ordered it right away! As for stats sheet and pictures you can find that online and comparison. I'm here to get you straight to the point, is it worth it to upgrade? The quick answer is ""Yes, and upgrade asap!!!“I've been using it for Kodi and IPTV. Mainly TiviMate app for iptv. With the 1st gen FireCube TV, its more smooth than any of the Firestick series. However, you can sense the lag when flipping through the native Amazon applications. When using with iptv/kodi apps, streaming content in mpeg and hls are still good or at least better than any of the Firesticks. Flipping through EPG with full animation for TiviMate shows some lag.Well FireCube TV 2nd Gen enters the room. Everything is a lot faster and much much more smoother!!! Flipping through apps has no lags. Switching between apps has no lag. EPG on TiviMate has no lags. I am one happy camper. Also Alexa commands is alot more responsive and do what your command in little to no time as the processing does it on device rather over the clouds. Many of the features of 2nd Gen.I highly recommend this new FireCube for streamers like me! Trust me on this one!!!Ps. You need to get HDMI cable, non-included.

",0.56,electronics,"Does not support Amazon Music Ultra High Definition audio, which I confirmed with Amazon customer service. I only bought this for that one reason, as my 4K fire stick is just fine.  The spec sheet states it supports ultra (well FLAC), and it did for a few days after I received it.  Amazon did an update and now will only support HD, not Ultra. Makes no sense and I think they are deceitful with how they are advertising both the cube and music.Very sad you cannot use an Amazon product to get the most out of an Amazon product!  Chew on that for a minute.
",0.8101055626,electronics,"As a previous reviewer stated the uhd music worked for a couple days and now it's only hd quality. I would have never spent the money on this cube if I had known that.  Everything else works fine, but I only bought it for the music feature.  I received a call from an amazon cust. rep right after I posted this review and she said they are working on an update so it will play uhd music. If and when that happens I would  definitely change my review to 5 stars.

Yes its plastic, yes its screen is only 1900x1200, yes its Media Tek processor is not the top processor available today, yes it ONLY has 2GB of ram.  However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.  I have zero productivity apps on it (which i like) I have zero communication apps on it (which I like), This tablet for me is a way to get away from life.  I have a phone for talking, and work, and teams, and slack.Dont kid yourself, this is not a high end tablet.  These one star reviews needs to take a better look at themselves and understand  you get what you pay for.  And for me, this absoutley works for what i need it to do.  And i dont feel like crap if i drop it and break it.why not five star.  Speakers are not great, again get what you pay for... which to me is not a big deal... i would of only taken a half a star off for them if I could.

",0.0578223477,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.0830963257,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.9716997157,electronics,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

Yes its plastic, yes its screen is only 1900x1200, yes its Media Tek processor is not the top processor available today, yes it ONLY has 2GB of ram.  However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.  I have zero productivity apps on it (which i like) I have zero communication apps on it (which I like), This tablet for me is a way to get away from life.  I have a phone for talking, and work, and teams, and slack.Dont kid yourself, this is not a high end tablet.

",0.0578223479,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.0830963259,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.

I  have read some reviews that are quite technical and way above my pay grade.  I will keep this simple.  The fire stick has been very, very, good for me.  Set up was a snap.  I don't have a smart TV,  just a fairly new, cheap, HD.  The picture is great and so is the sound.  If there are technical glitches I haven't noticed them.  I still need practice negotiating the screens, but that will come with time.  I am getting used to talking to a machine, but still say ""please"" when addressing Alexa.  I have already spent a couple of snow days catching up on two seasons of ""The Blacklist""  and have almost gotten through  ""Bosch "".  I still haven't had time for the movies.  There  is so much available it boggles the mind.  I guess all of this identifies me as an old person.  Well, I certainly am and for me the fire stick is the best thing to come along since the VCR.  I would highly recommend it for my fellow oldies who may be a bit leery about trying something out of their comfort zone.
",0.21706163910,electronics,"This isn't a review, but it is more of a statement... I just got my firestick a week ago and so far I am so unhappy with it. the setup and everything went fine it's just that on many of the movies I choose I have audio but no video, another issue is many of the basic channels that I thought were basic like lifetime and CBS and certain other ones I have to pay for to see. I thought they were many more free channels. Another thing, is the buffering. Most everything that I have tried to watch just keeps buffering and I can watch the same movie on my phone or my tablet which is the same Wi-Fi connection that I use for my TV and I can watch the whole movie before I can see anything on my TV. I'm about to send this back I don't understand what the big deal is with this item. and I tried to get local channels I can only get one local channel and then I can't even see it live. It just shows me what the latest headlines were on that news show. Please tell me something I don't know or that it will get better somehow.
",0.12173917910,electronics,"I dislike the fact that I had to pry the remote open with a pair of my scissors. I wish there was a simpler way to open it. Maybe I did not possess the strength to push it open. Also my firestick restarts itself randomly. Support helped me and I thought it fixed it but it did not. It's overheating!! I've had these issues before but not straight out the box. Really upsetting.
",0.06549102110,electronics,"We owned the initial firestick and had used it regularly for years.  A remote issue forced us to replace the unit, and I'm so glad we did!  The responsiveness and speed of the new version is amazing!  No more lagging or double click.  The new remote is also a huge upgrade with the voice control option.  It's a must have!
",0.85988134110,electronics,"This is an upgrade from my original firestick. The installation was so easy, Amazon is really good with their step by step instructions. It works perfectly but the thing I like even more than the voice control is the size of the remote. That original remote was ridiculously small and easy to loose.
",0.80449354610,electronics,"Out of the box I was disappointed with the remote. I couldn't get it opened to insert the batteries. Finally my husband used a screwdriver and forced it open. Meanwhile I had gotten onto Chat  for support and they had pretty quickly agreed to send me a  replacement, which would have arrived in three or four days. So I had to get on chat support again to get them to cancel the replacement. That was quick and easy. But if you have difficulty getting the battery compartment open, just use more force, and insert a small screwdriver to get it open. It's not as delicate as it seems at first.  Support was excellent.But I'm disappointed in the way the remote works. I would compare e it to a walkie talkie, not so much an Alexa device. You have to press a button in order to talk to the remote. So you have to have the remote in your hand in order to control the tv and turn it on/off.Our setup is that we have cable on just the living room tv. I got the Firestick for a second tv in a bedroom. And that second tv now is preferable to the livingroom tv. The remote makes it much easier to navigate. But the Alexa function is clumsy. I don't feel comfortable with the walkie talkie function, and Alexa isn't really smooth, though I suppose it will improve. Suggestions for use do pop up on screen.  So there's a learning curve for me, and I suppose for the Alexa system.  I do like the remote and the way it controls the screen content. But the Alexa interface isn't so satisfactory.I have several Alexa devices scattered around the house, so I'm familiar with the interface, and like it, and am addicted to it. But I just don't like the way Alexa works in this application. Or more accurately, I don't like the button. And in a setting where you have several people watching, only the person with the remote controls the tv, just as with an older remote system. And the remote is very small, and easily lost, so beware.
",0.03816616510,electronics,"We live in a house with several high tech toys,  The TVs are all smart, so I never had use for one of these.  Several friends had the firestick and seemed to enjoy them.  We also have a video projector which requires an input source, which I had used a smart blu ray player.  During a recent sale I went ahead and bought one thinking it would be an easier option for an input source.  Setup was easy enough, but performance was a big disappointment, compared to the blu ray app for amazon video prime, the firestick did not show at a suitable video quality.  We have multiple hdmi inputs and even tested at the same time.  I moved the firestick to test on the tvs, still a disappointing video quality.  We also noticed a flicker now and then which was annoying (every few minutes.  There are only 2 of us, so not an issue of over used bandwidth, our wifi is strong and speed is high.  Our main issue is poor video quality.  Going to do more testing, but this device failed to meet expectations.Update:  Amazon reached out to me based on my review.  I had to call them back so I was at my device.  After 3 dropped calls I was able see the call through to the end.  The customer service rep was no help.  She had no way to improve  the video quality,  and even though it is an Amazon product they will not replace it  because it was bought through one of their vendors and not them directly.  If Amazon is not willing to stand behind their product sold through a vendor, they should not sell their devices through vendors.

With it, I can record, CBS, ABC, NBC, FOX, Me TV and watch the recorded shows on any of my 6 TV's with various forms of the Fire TV Devices.Not that Amazon needs my defending... but I feel the need to address some of the complaints by folks that are mostly not up to the task of using the product.1. Can't get the battery cover off the remote. I've experienced it.... used a single edged razor blade to start it.... and never had another problem. Heck I have to use pliers to get the Kraft salad dressing lids off... so I feel your pain.2. Buffering... If your using the free modem that your ISP gave you, you are asking for problems.  I've got a Linksys 5400, better part of $300... but I've got about 75 wifi devices... no problem handing out a great stream of my Fiber Optic Internet.3. No Auio, No Video... you've got a defective TV or Fire Stick.... use another TV and a DVD/Blue Ray player to figure out which and replace. Hopefully it's the fire stick.4. Complaints that you have to pay for content you thought would be free. Locals... Fire Recast if antenna gets it. Direct TV Now if not.5. Complaints it won't run You Tube TV.... I can envision that could be frustrating.  I envision Amazon will eventually support it, if it takes off... or I've looked at You Tube TV and all it's content IS available elsewhere.6. Over Priced? If there are other cheaper products that meet your needs buy them.  The best way of getting Amazon to ""hear"" you is with your wallet.7. Didn't hook to my 3 receivers.... (volume)... sorry but it hooked brain dead easy to my 2 Pioneers and 1 Sony..8. In app interface funky.... I don't understand this one.  I've used Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and a couple of others on various devices... it seems as though the app interface is by service (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime etc.) not by device ie Firestick, Roku, Apple TV. I could be wrong.9. Won't warrent the product.... there is a warranty period... they will for that time... or buy an extended warranty.I suppose I'm an Amazon Fanboy. 8 echo dots, 2 echo shows, an Echo Connect Amazon Recast.With Echo I can turn off or on every light in my house.

",0.05782234712,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.08309632512,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

Im pleased with the storage capacity and battery life as well.Downloading apps are easy too, through Amazon Appstore. Ive already been to all of my social media sites with it.It' s wonderful and powerful, in every way!

",0.97169971512,electronics,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.

",0.84786665413,electronics," Coming from a Fire HD 7, then a ""Kids"" Kindle 8, this is really an impressive and welcome upgrade.So I really want, and need, to explain that the only difference between the ""kids edition"" and the regular one, other than price, is that the ""kids edition"" comes with--A kidproof case (and this one even has a kickstand!!) Which yes, the kindle kid cases are amazing with protection.-The year of Free Time, which is the kids gaming platform.-The 2 year replacement guarantee (that I have used in the past for a broken screen. SUPER easy process. You have to CALL Amazon to do this, it cannot be done via your order page; Return the kindle without case to Amazon, they ship you a replacement kindle without the case.)O N L Y differences. So when I see all of these negative reviews about the kids kindle, then I jump over to the positive reviews on the normal kindle, it's baffling. And I did compare the two because it's a $50 price difference, and what really sold this version for me, rather than buying everything separately, was the 2 year replacement guarantee.My child started out with my Fire HD 7, which you can switch between adult and kid profiles on as well. Any kindle can be a kids kindle as long as you've got a childs profile set up. Once she got bigger/older, we bought her the kids edition 8. So the kids edition 10 is her Christmas gift this year. It's so much faster than the 8, obviously bigger. And I loved that with having it connected to my account before shipment, setup was fast-All the hard work was done and I just had to select a pin for this device, it was set up and ready to go within 10 minutes. Memory card slot on the side, removal and replacement of the case is MUCH easier than on the 8. The volume on this thing is loud, crisp, and clear.With the 10, the only differences I've noticed that would be worth mentioning is that usually on the other kindles, you would pull down the settings bar to click on the icon and switch profiles. With this one it seems you've got to lock, click the icon, then switch profiles. Not a big deal to me and I'm sure it wont be to her. She uses my profile for regular youtube and roblox, just normal things that aren't accessible on the kids/free time dashboard. Other difference here is that it now uses a USBC charger, which is another positive since every phone in my house uses USBC so it's easier to replace and keep up with.The free time dashboard. Lots of negative feedback on that one; So sometime ago, maybe in the last year or 2 I think, free time had an update. I HATED the update. It jumbled literally everything together and she had to look for all of her downloaded games, just randomly clicking on everything. But this was a year or 2 ago and the dashboard on the 10 is no different than the dash on the 7 and 8. It's just the same free time update that's been there for a year or 2 now.She has an ipad air that we have her school apps on. They weren't available on kindle so we keep the ipad around for homework. She absolutely hates the ipad. So if your kid is an apple fan, they may not like this one. My daughter had 2 kindles before she got an ipad from a relative so she was already used to the interface. iPad is easy for her too but she would rather not use anything, than reach for the ipad when the kindle is dead/charging.For anyone wanting more in depth reviews on this Kindle, jump on over to the Kindle 10 listing and read them there because there is virtually no difference between the ""Kids Edition"" and the regular 10.
",0.82590067413,electronics," Amazon rushed this product. The tablet itself is so flimsy the screen is discolored and you barely push on it and it looks like the screen is going to break. I’m gently pressing on the screen and you can see it changing colors. Does NOT look childproof to me. Ridiculously overpriced.

Tried resetting it and it failed to complete 7 times. Support was absolutely useless, tried 3 different times hoping to get someone who might know the issue. They all said send it back for a refund. I gave up on the restore and set it up as a new device. The device seems well made but the support for it is absolutely useless, Simply disappointed!!

Like another review I am very disappointed that the transfer option doesn't work. I reset the damn thing about 10 times trying to get the applications and data over. Also any SD card from an older device will not copy over, the SD card must be formatted on this device.I highly recommend getting a large SD card to go with this. We bought a 128GB card so I shouldn't need to ever worry about space.This is a great kids tablet with great screen. It is much faster than older models with increased storage. Including USB-C is wonderful and I can now get rid of my micro-usb chargers laying around.Highly recommended!
",0.78047579513,electronics,"I like it so far.  I upgraded from the previous Kindle Kids Fire 10 inch.  I think it's a worthy upgrade.  The battery life is better, processor I believe is snappier and most importantly it uses USB-C now so I can ditch the micro USB cables lying around my home and car.  The USB-C charges faster and in either direction, so I don't have to fumble around flipping the micro USB if it's dark.  However the included charger here is only 9W.  My chargers at home are 15 or 18W so I don't use the 9W one at all.I am docking 1 star on this because I can no longer install apps onto the microSD card.  That was possible on old Kids Fire tablets.I bought 2 of these at a 2 for 1 discount.  I also sent in my old Kids Fire 10 for a $30 gift card.  These are for my little toddler boys, who love them.  I do recommend getting this latest edition over any other Kids Kindle tablets.
",0.8195586213,electronics,"There’s a reason why Apple products cost more!This is my first non Apple product in a long time, and the quality of this tablet doesn’t match up to our old ipad mini 2.

It’sa kids tablet, should be easy to use, and this software is just opposite of that.Also, the software ota update failed, and that was ghe first thing that happened after I fed internet to the tablet. Not a great first impression!But it will do the job of searching kids YouTube videos easier.
",0.16686123614,electronics,"Pros:• This is a solid built machine. Very sturdy and no dust cracks, while retaining its simple form. One of the few times I can say you’re getting exactly what every picture on the web is showing.• I had the basic black design, but I do appreciate that Amazon is offering more colors rather than there basic set (even if it’s only a few generic colors).• The mute option is the most appreciative tool. When you activate it the classic blue glow will fall into the red, giving you the visual display that your privacy is being protected.• The sound performs exactly what it’s built for. I found no issue in testing in an open living room. The volume goes to great levels as once again, for a 360-degree smart speaker, Amazon reigns supreme.• Testing all ranges of music, I found that that bass to be rich and powerful. My colleague has the previous Echo Plus and she states that there is an improvement in the bass with this Echo. An overall rich sound when a piano came in and a warmer outcome when acoustics came into play (You’ll get the bass experience when you hit those hard beats).• Like any other model, the Bluetooth connectivity between a third party stereo works flawlessly. I tested this out with some Bose surround sound, and nothing but clear music. You can also pair the Echo if you have smaller / weaker speakers. Both together will pump up the experience.• The connectivity is so flawless that buying two of these devices (or use Echo’s previous versions, if you have one) and put them in separate locations doesn’t make this a bad idea. You’re going to get great quality in music without paying an am or a leg for it.• I have to appreciate Amazon for not pushing their music platform. They offer the usual Spotify (which I used) but also Apple Music, Deezer, TuneIn, even BBC sounds. You’re getting a lot more features than just a basic smart speaker.• Using Google Home for over a year I can say that just saying “Alexa” felt more natural than saying “Ok Google.” Not to mention having Alexa listen to me every time I said: “Alexa” (Google Home users will understand this).• Like before, smart applications fit like a glove in this system. I only used it for lights and the Echo was spot on. This feature is more common than ever on any smart speaker, and the Echo does what it’s supposed to do.• I admire the organization of the app because it’s your remote control on anything you want the Echo to do. Turn off lights, switch music, mute volume, install new features, and so forth. We all carry our phones like carrying our driver licenses when going outside. This day in age I’ll always prefer an app than a physical remote.• I did some Alexa calls on this and found only clear responses and answers (this will depend on your Wi-Fi).• I would give 70% of Alexa sounding more human.• Everything is in the cloud so, you don’t need to worry about manual updates. All taken care of.• As I mentioned before, everything else is the same in a smart speaker. Ask for the weather, traffic, upcoming appointments, and all other general questions. I didn’t test all of them because…well is the same technology as last year.• The biggest difference in my book is the price. Newer and cheaper.Cons and Oks:• No Zigbee controller. This isn’t much of an issue, but if you already have a smart house layout than you’ll need to spend some extra time configuring with the Echo. The issue for this is that it puts more work on the Echo than you need. Also, there may be some smart devices that won’t work on the Echo because of this. I know last year's models had some connectivity issues with Philips Hue bulbs. Keep an eye out for which smart devices are compatible with the Echo.• I did notice that the app slows down when you put a lot of apps and smart applications in the Echos. I tested a lot of features out that require a decent amount of downloads, but the results did create a delay in the app. I have to assume without Zigbee’s software, if you have a lot of smart applications connected to the Echo, and with the general apps you use, there will be a delay in the long run.• The Echo gets loud. Loud enough that you’ll get some distortion when you’re around 95% in volume. The effect is shown when a lot of bass is begin made. Please note that 90% and up is booming your entire house.• Compare to Google Home, Alexa still isn’t the brightest smart speak in the family. For the basic day to day task it works fine, but those random questions that we tend to have throughout the day Alexa doesn’t deliver. Alexa will usually provide you with a quick one-sentence summary (Unlike Google, it would provide you a short paragraph.). This issue doesn’t happen all the time, but you’ll notice it when it does.• I’m trying to learn Spanish, so asking smile Spanish questions with Alexa is not reliable. Example I will say “Alexa, what does “Qué estás haciendo” in Spanish mean (What are you doing?)? Alexa will say “What are you happy.” I’ve been studying for 6 moths so my speech on that sentence was spot on, but Alexa. Not a reliable study buddy.• I had the first version of the Echo and all I can say is I miss the rotation ring. Bring it back Amazon.• The design is nothing new. It’s built very solid, but it’s identical to Echo Plus 2. My colleague had the Echo Plus and putting them aside there was no way you can tell the difference (a nice note if you want to steal your friends and replace it with the last version).• Even the sound is almost similar to the previous Echo. Both are fantastic, but almost the same.Bottom Line:It’s a great smart speaker system, but almost identical in every way as its previous model. There is nothing wrong with that because Amazon does put in a lot of features into this Echo that makes this right in the top three (Google Home, HomePods, and the Echo Family). It’s accurate, excellent sound, and lower in price than its previous model.Some concerns are the effects in the long run with those who have a decent amount of smart applications, and making sure the compatibility can be performed accurately. Also knowing the limits of what Alexa can and can’t do as the hardware is identical to its previous version. I wouldn’t be surprised if you want to just read Echo’s previous model amazon reviews. Trust me when I say that they’re almost identical in sight and performance.In the end, the reason it doesn’t matter about the flaws is because the price is well worth what you’re getting. It’s a machine that I can see using it every day for the simplest things such as setting up an alarm to enjoying it in small parties. I will say that if you’re planning to use your surround sound stereo connected to this, then this is a must buy. You pay a heavy price for a HomePod, enjoy a generic performance for a Google Home, and are presented with an overall user-friendly experience with the Echo 3. Cheaper than its predecessor and the worth every penny.Overall: A tiny upgrade from its previous model, but still an excellent experience in sound for all.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer
",0.94468158514,electronics,"I purchased my first Alexa Echo 1st Gen two years ago and I fell in love right away! It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1.  This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons.

The addition of the powered Echo sub fills in the lows to make it an immersive experience.Setup was fairly easy.  My only complaint was that I had trouble renaming the 2nd Echo itself.

",0.08730396615,electronics," Verified purchase and authentic video from this camera.It's tiny! (That's what she said...) In all seriousness, it is a very small camera. But so far, it seems to be a very competent device. The colors are sharp and crisp, the resolution is amazing and it's everything I've come to expect from Ring.The camera is a fixed position camera (no pan/tilt feature), but it does have a wide viewing angle. The images you see are as clean and distinct on the far edges as they are in the center of the picture/video. It really is a nice view.The only reservation I have with this camera is Amazon and Ring's willingness to use our cameras for law enforcement. Mind you, I'm not breaking any laws, but at the same time I'm not willing to give any company the ability to view my private life with or without my consent. As far as I know, neither company is using the data from my cameras for their own reasons, but I'm still suspect of their intent.However, despite my tin-foil hat and conspiracy theories, I'm loving my Ring camera. It has two-way communication and an alarm to scare my dogs when they fall asleep on the couch. Bad dog! Get off the couch and don't bark at me, you silly puppy! I digress, it's a fantastic device and for the price ($60 at the time of this review), it's everything we expect from Ring. Five stars.
",0.89410299115,electronics,"I am very disappointed in the functionality of this product.Having indoor security is a great thing but I do not wanna have to give up all of my privacy to get it. There are plenty of reasons why a person may not want to be recorded inside their home. Currently, you have no options for turning off the cameras from the app.After more than half an hour on the phone with customer support, they made it clear that there was no option for privacy except for physically unplugging the cameras.  This is extremely impractical. My cameras, for instants, are mounted up at the ceiling and need a ladder to access.  I'm sure that I do not need to give you examples of all the reasons that this would be problematic, since I can think of a half dozen off the top of my head.Another possible partial solution would be restricting what information shared users can see. Currently there don't seem to be any options at all about how much someone can see if you share your account with them. If they were option settings for sharing, I could decide how much they see.  But there aren't.I am still deciding if I will be keeping these new cameras or not.
",0.75136339715,electronics,"Pros:CostDaylight videoEasy SetupCons:Hardware that comes with it will not mount into studs (screws too shallow).Power cord is a proprietary micro USB (plug recessed deep on the camera) so unable to use just any micro-usb plug.Night video has issues keeping everything in focus (blurry top of the screen)First and foremost, its a 60 dollar camera.  The least expensive camera Ring has produced.  I have the Doorbell Pro, and the floodlight camera watching the front and back of my house, so was excited to see a cheaper option to put one in my garage.The camera itself is incredibly small, almost the size of the ring doorbell itself.  Setting it up was a breeze if you already have a Ring device.  Took me 15 minutes to get the camera up and running and added to my existing Ring app.The video quality is on par with the other devices in the daylight.  No complaints about that.  The night vision however,  seems like it has some issues.  I've noticed that anything on the top of the screen comes off blurry and out of focus in night vision.  I haven't experienced that with other ring cameras, and may be due to mounting the camera high on the wall and it having an issue keeping everything in focus.  I know they increased the viewing angles on this model, so it may also have to do with that.  Its purely speculation, but it is a 60 dollar camera, so not a deal breaker for me.  Its not like Spiderman will be breaking into my garage.The biggest negative on this device however (and why I took away a star) is the hardware.  The mounting screws are far too shallow to get through drywall and into a stud.  So they include the anchors for drywall, and you will need to mount this into the anchors.  This seems like a huge miss considering most Ring devices account for this and always have included the appropriate hardware.The other negative is the power cord.  Six foot is hardly enough to work with.  With the camera being powered with a micro-usb, if you're thinking ""well just buy a longer usb cord"", that won't work.  The plug in on the back of the camera is far too recessed for anything other than the cord that it comes with.  So unless you're looking to use a typical 120 extension cable, make sure you're planning on mounting this close to the outlet.

",0.90201020215,electronics,"I love Ring products. They are a great idea and work well.I just received a two pack indoor cameras which arrived promptly but one of the two power supplies was defective.I decided to chat customer support. In my opening chat I gave my name, described the problem, explained what I did to troubleshoot the problem and how I confirmed a dead power supply. The agent didn’t even read it and wasted my time asking questions that were already answered.The support chat took over 20 minutes with long delays between responses and the agent was still not able to confirm shipment of a replacement. It was as if the agent was working several calls and not focused on my chat.Defective product plus poor customer service is a recipe to loose loyal customers.  I was an early adopter of Ring and have many of their products. This experience has given me pause when considering them in the future or recommending Ring to others.
",0.76541674115,electronics,"Very easy setup, great image quality (light or dark), great audio quality, nice form-factor, perfect integration with my Ring network.INSTALL:This took about 4 minutes to set-up. That includes opening the box and updating my Ring app. Amazing! This is my 3rd Ring camera (first of this type), and I also have 3 other d-link cameras and 15+ other network-connected smart home devices and this one had been the easiest to set-up, by far! Most have required at least one call to CustSvc at some point in the process (& I'm very familiar with IOT and network installs). I didn't need any of that knowledge with this new Ring device. I'd recommend you install/update your Ring app first, as that was my only hiccup (old versions dont have the new hardware listed).APP:So: install/update Ring app > Open box > remove and unwrap device & plug (usb to 2-prong usb) > plug in to outlet > in the app, tap add device (or devices > add...) > Quick scan of barcode w/phone camera > and viola! you're off to play with some settings and have more convenience/security/peace of mind in your life!In the app, you can adjust motion zones, notification sound/volume, link to other devices, snooze motion, and other functions, as with the other Ring cameras.MOUNT:It can be mounted on a flat shelf surface, on the wall, or on the ceiling. Wall anchors and screws are included. And w/your own philips head screwdriver, the base moves to the back for wall mounting. The base also articulates quite a bit, maintaining stability, and holding its position well. It seems very well thought-out in that regard.USE:I'm using this in an unconventional way. My laundry room isn't easy to get to, so I have the cam pointed at my machines in the hopes of being able to check on loads before stopping what I'm doing and making the trek to a mid-cycle load. (Or for a quick chat with hubby if he's in there). I also plan to position it to capture other utilities, to check on any alarms that might be triggered (fire, smoke, flood...). Here's hoping i never need it for that. (pics to show light & dark quality; no editing or filters. I know I gotta clean up in there 😄)I rely on reviews to help me make informed decisions. I hope this review helped you :)
",0.97290611315,electronics,"I needed a cam to see the inside of the house when we are out. Decided to give this one a try since it was meant to be indoors.Pros:- smaller profile (I placed this cam next to the Ring Stickup Battery Cam, and an 8oz bottle of water for comparison)- easy setup (took a total of 2 minutes to get up and running)- two way audio had a delay, but still less than my Arlo cams.Cons:- initial lag. At least on my device, there seems to be about 2 seconds worth of feed that is “fastforwarded” before the stream stabilizes. Not a deal breaker, but the other ring cams I have do not do this.Overall, great product that fulfills a niche purpose. Cheap alternative if you need specifically, an economical indoor cam.
",0.515,electronics,"I really like the size of the indoor cam compared to the stickup cam wired (Gen 2). It is noticeably smaller in size and looks better when used inside. Overall the picture quality is nice, sound works well (I am able to control an Alexa Show through the camera), and it captured motion events reliably.Comparing to the stickup cam wired, there are a few things to note. The stickup cam shows color video in lower light before switching to IR night vision as compared to the indoor cam. Also, the indoor cam has a narrower field of view, but to be honest, I likely only noticed because I did a side by side comparison of them; without seeing them sitting next to each out, I doubt you would notice, but it is a difference.  I didn't find anything the indoor cam did better except for physical looks, however, is it a fraction of the cost of the stickup cam wired (soon to be re-released as stickup cam elite). If you are in the market for an indoor camera, I would strongly recommend looking at this one unless you need POE, in which case the Stickup Cam Elite (or Gen 2 Wired) is the better choice.
",0.87046951115,electronics,"I think it's best for this cam placement if you put it with a crowded counter or shelf to not be as noticeable as a recording camera. Once set,  it hides well.I already have 2 doorbells and 3 chimes and an outdoor cam with siren and security lights.I have another type of indoor cameras, the WYZE cams ... you can see my review on that in my reviews section ... they are not reliable at all. They are very hard to use when away from home .. can't share the videos from the phone. One even just stopped working!! Low priced,  and in this case,  you get what you pay for!This new indoor cam was easy as heck to set up and connect to the app to go right with my other cams. The view is amazing! The picture quality and sound is the best! Yes,  you'll pay more,  but do it! It's worth it.None of the RING products have EVER let me down,  close to home or away!
",0.8214613216,electronics,"I had the echo 5 and I can't stand the ""try Alexa"" phrases at the bottom. From all the reviews I read on the 5 I wasn't the only one. I hope Amazon realized that people didn't like this. I will be returning this. At least make it a option.
",0.76534187816,electronics,"Over and over, in the ""most helpful"" reviews, I read about ""ads"" displaying. This does NOT ever display ads, it displays Alexa skills and things to try with your device. I read that people cannot get that to stop happening. It's right in the settings: go to: ---Home & Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Discovery---, that will end the Alexa skills displaying (may cycle once after setting but then they're gone for good). I kept reading that people who want to use it as a clock were upset that the clock kept getting minimized (to left corner) to show other things. That's because, yet again, they aren't setting it up correctly. So, in the settings: go to: ---Home & Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Rotate Continuously---, that will make the Home screen always display a full screen clock. You can also just turn off any content in that list. Note that each time you go into the settings, immediately after, it WILL show you a single skill or any content you left on. But that's it. It will just be a clock from then on, until you interact with it again and then it may display a single skill or that content. Once. Then back to being a full time clock.Full disclosure: I got this to use as an alarm clock and not as a primary viewing assistant. For that, I recommend the larger echo devices. I also got this on Prime Day for $50 (rather than $90). That's a screaming good deal for what is basically a voice activated, smart alarm clock with a lot of different options.Decent Alarm clocks run $30-50 anyways so I thought I'd give this device a try for $50. I should have bought 2. Even for $90, I feel like this is a great device but if you wait, it will eventually go on sale again. I don't intend to use it to watch TV shows or movies, I have TVs, tablets and PCs for that. I saw people mentioning being disappointed in the resolution or screen quality. I don't see the problem. This certainly isn't going to compare to your $300-800 smart phone screen but it's not bad looking when playing videos or displaying the clock. It's similar to say, an iPhone 3 or Galaxy S2. I feel like the people complaining are expecting ""the moon"" for the money this costs. It's $90. Not $150 or $200.There was alot of fairly bad reviews on the echo 5, but I wanted something bigger that I could use to see my ring doorbell video.  Setup was easy and got it running no problem.  Tried ""alexa show me the front door""... and nothing worked!!  No panic, went and pushed the ring doorbell and checked my phone, live video seen no problem.  OK, try Echo again ""alexa show my the front door""  Bingo!!  video displayed in about 3 sec's (i'd seen comments it was taking over 11 seconds) but that's not what I experienced.Next sound quality, tried a few songs... Wow I was not expecting much in the audio quality, but it was actually really good and as a side benefit, it displays the words of the song as it's sang, pretty cool.  Basically all the other alexa functions work as with any device, but now you also get video feedback. Ask about the weather,  get your info, plus it displays the  temp, clouds, sun, whatever...  Very happy with purchase and highly recommended!!
",0.94541025216,electronics,"I really do enjoy this device and am impressed at the abilities of Alexa. That said, until they add the option to disable the “Try Alexa” suggestions on the bottom of the home screen I can’t recommend it and will not be buying addition units.Looking online I am far from the only person driven crazy by this so I hope Amazon listens to the feedback and makes this possible in a future update.

I have 3 Ring cameras, front door bell, a front & back yard motion light cameras. Once I followed the steps to add Ring in the Alexa app, like 2 minutes, It was so intuitive I don't know what I did right but another 5 minutes I said Alexa show front door and she said okay and there was my front door camera on the screen. Then I said Alexa, show back which is what I named the devise ""back"" and she said okay and showed the back yard camera, same with the front successfully. I have many more smart devices the Alexa app found on my wi-fi so I'm excited to figure out how to add them.Also, now I understand the importance of naming the devices. Alexa only understands exactly what you name them in the devise list for voice commands.

There is no apparent reason for this, nor is it highlighted in the marketing for the ES8. Amazon, please update the ES8 software to permit at least the same range of clockfaces as the ES5.

They constantly scroll overtop of the pictures  and photos that you upload to the home screen and wallpaper, making them really hard to ignore.  And the clock is so small in the upper left corner, that you have to be right on top of it to read it.  I couldn't take it any more and had to return my new Echo Show 8.

It looks very good.The sound is very solid in the echo show 8.I think the 8 is a compressed version on the 10 inch version.

",0.05782234717,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.

We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.

",0.519,electronics,"This is my very in-depth review for:Echo Flex - Plug-in smart speaker with AlexaIf you prefer a quicker summary, go straight to the summary section.Background:A bit of background here will probably be good. I own two Echo Dots (2nd Gen), 1 Echo Spot, and two Echo Dots (3rd Gen). Little by little I have been getting my feet wet in the home automation pit. I have added smart bulbs, smart locks, smart plugs, and smart switches. To this point, I have found that with the Echo devices I own, I can cover most of my house, except for my garage (That was about to change…).For a while though I have been thinking I should get another Echo for my garage. My main needs are: turning on/off the garage lights with my voice instead of an app (I use the Wyze Bulbs), to use voice control for my kitchen door which has a Yale/August smart lock, and for reminders or quick shopping whenever I am working on a project.The day that the Echo Flex was announced, I said, I gotta try one of those, so I ordered one. While I did have my reservations on the “not optimized for music statement”, that was not the reason I was getting it and I do have a Bluetooth speaker I could use with it if I ever wanted to listen some music in the garage.Installation:The installation was a breeze, had the echo running in about 1 minute. Just as installing any other Echo:- Connect the device to an outlet- Open the Alexa app, click on the menu and select “Add Device”- Select “Amazon Echo”, then select “Echo Flex” (close to the bottom of the page.).- Follow the screen prompts as needed. Done.At this point if you have a Bluetooth speaker to be added, I would do that as well. The process is pretty much the same, using the Alexa app to pair them up.Positives:What Like the most about the Echo Flex, is its size and convenience. It is an Echo. It doesn’t take a lot of counterspace which is always a plus. It also has a USB port underneath for adding attachments, I do not have any of those yet, but knowing that I liked the Flex so far, I might get the motion sensor attachment. If not, you can always use that port to charge your phone ☺. It uses a single outlet and is designed in a way that it could be plugged in, even when other big plugs are connected in the top outlet. Finally, we got the price; it goes for 25$ regular price. Knowing how functional this device is, this is a great deal.Negatives:The product description specifically states that this Echo is not optimized for music. I can attest that this is true. The sound quality is not bad, it is just that the bass is not there and there is an extremely faint quasi-metallic echo to it, it sounds very similar to how some old speakers would sound back in the day, just with much better voice clarity. If you own a Bluetooth speaker, then this is not a problem at all, if not then just know that music is not its forte.Other thoughts:I tried to be as comprehensive as I could in this review. However, since I have only used my Echo Flex for about a week, I will update my review as needed if any nuances show up.__________________________Summary:This is a very impressive unit, that works well for anyone either getting their feet wet in the home automation pit or looking to expand their Dots listening range. They will get the job done. They will take one outlet and no “counter space” making them an affordable voice controller for any device. It will play music on them, but the sound quality is subpar for that. At this price point though, they are probably the best voice control device available and although not perfect, well deserving of a five-star rating.If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.

",0.99470102819,electronics,"The GOOD:-Price:  At $25, this is one of the least expensive Echo options.  It is less expensive than the Dot, and is one of the cheapest ways to add Alexa to your home.-Utility:  Most people that I've talked to about this product were looking forward to having an Echo device that they could use in a small space, like a hallway or bathroom.  These areas are usually not ideal for placing an Echo or Echo Dot, but the Echo Flex is perfect for the job.  I found the Flex to be useful by my front door, and in a hallway where I didn't have room for an Echo device before.-Flexibility:  The Flex supports at least two add-on devices; a night light and a motion sensor.  Each one plugs into the USB port at the bottom of the Flex. The smart night light is pretty useful; it functions as a regular night light, but it can also be assigned routines in the Alexa app.  You can also change the brightness and select one of 16 colors.  The motion sensor allows for new routines that are triggered by any detected motion.  It was easy to set up a routine that turns my smart lights on when motion is detected by the Flex motion sensor.  The light and the motion sensor are each $15 currently, which seems like a pretty good deal to me, as I've found the motion sensor to be particularly useful.The BAD:-Speaker:  This 0.6"" speaker is actually fine for just talking to Alexa, but it is definitely not designed for playing music.  I feel like the speakers on my phone sound better than the Flex as far as music playback.  This is not a really big deal to me, as I hadn't planned on listening to music on the Flex, and for regular calls or Drop Ins it sounds fine.  It is also worth noting that the Flex does come with an audio out connection where you could hook up your own speakers if you were interested in playing music.Overall:This little device seems like it is worth getting in two specific situations:  A) You want Alexa in an area of the house like a hallway where you can't place any other Echo device, or B)  You want to use a motion sensor to trigger routines.  For either of these purposes, the Flex is great and is an inexpensive solution.  If, however, you were looking for something that can also double as a speaker to play music, this is probably not the device for you.I will update this review if I encounter any issues over time, or to answer any questions that you have.

",0.99138426819,electronics,"I got this for one of the primary reasons I suspect most multi-echo households will.  The size.  My house has a large central room that all the other rooms feed off of.  We have echoes in just about every room in the house, except the central room.  The main reason for that is the cords that are on the dots.  I would have loved a 3G dot in this central room, but the location of all the power outlets make it visually unappealing.  I'd have to run a cord to where I could put the dot, and that would just look bad.So when Amazon announced this little item, it was an automatic purchase.  Now I know we don't have it for music - my office setup handles that (Two Echo 2.0's & the echo subwoofer).  But my wife does not have a particularly loud voice, and when she tries to issue commands to turn on lights in other rooms, it frequently mishears her.So I wanted one for this central room, but didn't want a cord.  This is perfect.  The voice isn't as good as a regular speaker, but that's to be expected.  But it does work as something for light conversation - or commands to turn lights on and off.One goofy thing about this, I have it on an outlet near the floor, and to that, our cats checked it out immediately upon installation. There is a skill you can do to make your device meow like a cat, and it was most enjoyable.Anyway, the device is small - I have pictures below of the thing in my hand before I installed it.Bottom line is - this does what it says.  Adds Alexa to areas where it wasn't before via a very small footprint device.  It lacks sound fidelity due to its size, but if you know that going on, and don't plan on this to be your primary music source, then you're good.
",0.10211595919,electronics,"If it did not have a speaker, I would have rated higher. However it does and it sounds like a radio my great great grandfather would have had - very tinny and the loudest volume is limited. I was hoping to listen to talk radio in the morning, but it sounds horrible even for that. With all the inexpensive small Bluetooth speakers out there, they certainly could have fit a better sounding speaker in this small footprint and a low cost. I love the idea of this, especially the USB port where I can plug something else in (my electric toothbrush uses USB) and turn my 2 socket outlet into a 3 socket unit. But the bad sound trumps all - making this great idea a very poor execution.
",0.16174620419,electronics,"Wow!  They are finally letting me review this.  It arrived several days ago and when I tried to review it earlier today it said it hadn't yet been released.  So here are some random thoughts.It is a nice addition to my 1st gen and 2nd gen Echo family.  I've added this to my kitchen where my greatest need was a timer.  No need to go to (or yell to and wonder if she really heard)  the living room to set timers anymore.Set up was easy as usual through the Alexa App.Alexa's voice sounds off, so I was surprised to find the music comes through quite well.  Not great, but surprisingly good for the size and just fine for a noisy kitchen.I wasn't sure what to expect from the Flex, but I'm very pleased I got this  Price-wise it is a great deal!
",0.94049060319,electronics,"This is an Echo Dot with a tiny speaker that plugs directly into the wall. That means that the sound quality is low; despite being called a ""smart speaker"" it can barely play music and even the voice quality is poor (Alexa's own voice is small and tinny). But it can go many more places much less obtrusively than a Dot.It's called the ""Flex"" because accessories can be plugged into the USB port on the bottom, potentially giving it many additional abilities. As happens too often in the electronic-gadget market, though, those accessories mostly don't exist yet; whether more than two or three ever will remains to be seen. That is probably why at the moment Amazon's product description doesn't dwell much on the ""Flex"" aspects. Perhaps many useful and imaginative accessories are coming and Amazon decided to release the Flex before they are ready so as not to miss the Holiday season. Or perhaps not.There are use cases for a small Dot with a tiny speaker that plugs directly into the wall. But that's just about all this is for now.  And suggesting that this device itself qualifies as a speaker is unrealistic.
",0.76235187119,electronics,"I'm a HUGE fan of Echo devices. I have one in nearly .... *thinking* ... yes, nearly every room (I don't have one in the dining room but only because the ones in other rooms can pick up my voice while I'm in the dining room). I even have a car one so ... when I saw this one ... I was PRETTY intrigued. I bought it to go in the bathroom, to replace my Dot that I have in there, plugged into and hanging on the wall via a bulky thing made just for it that you can find on Amazon (that I don't mind ... I'm just saying it's bulky).The set up on the Flex is just as easy as the set up on other devices. You plug it in, it starts up and if it's registered and you have an Alexa account on your phone, you're set to go.PRO - there's a USB port on the bottom of the Flex, so you can plug in a charger cord or a fan cord or whatever you want that is USB powered. Nifty! I was going to plug in a night light.But, the sound. So, the sound is not as good as the most recent generation of Dots (pre the one with the clock, I haven't tried that one yet). It's a much smaller speaker, obviously, and the sound isn't as rich. I plugged it into the outlet in the bathroom, turned on the shower and hopped in for a listen. Even at the highest volume, it wasn't really the sound I was looking for to get me going in the morning. Boo. So, I replaced it with my bulky Dot and took the Flex into my computer room, where I don't really NEED an Echo device because I have a Fire TV with Alexa built in but ... my family can't drop in on that (NOT a bad thing, right?).Because of my outlet situation, I ended up putting it in an outlet midway up the wall, behind a small lamp. I had to turn it upside down. I noticed that either because it's in a bigger space (13'x9') or because it's upside down, the sound is better but still not like a Dot but still passable. Like a first generation Dot's sound.Anyhow, my husband dropped in on me with it last night and it worked great. It would be great for a garage or a small bathroom without a shower or somewhere where there isn't a lot of background noise. Of course, you can use the USB to plug in a speaker but ... there's already a speaker. It's literally touted as a mini-speaker!I also found the voice pickup wasn't as responsive as my newest Dot. It responds but you have to give it a second to wake up to your voice and speak slower.I don't want you to think I don't like this Flex ... I really do. I think it's perfect for certain spaces ... ones that don't have a lot of background noise and are smaller. I really like the added USB and I like the shape and the way it looks on the wall. I think if you're going to have Echo devices, you should have them in every room (especially as you age) and they should be the right ones for each room. This one serves a purpose for specific spaces and the price is certainly right.
",0.519,electronics,"I've been using Echo devices for years now and have Echos, Dots and a Show 5 around the house.  But there are still places where Alexa doesn't hear me well and it's either a complete guess which device will respond to me, like in a hallway,  or can't hear me at all, like in my master bathroom.  The Flex is great for those spots where your need is more for a way to talk to Alexa or trigger a Routine than to rely on the device as a primary speaker.The mics on it are very good. The speaker is clearly not the selling point of this device, but it's fine for basic questions and commands, most spoken content, communicating with a Ring doorbell, DropIn,  or giving commands to another device.  You wouldn't want to listen to music on it and it doesn't get terribly loud,  but it's loud enough for a small space like a hallway or bath.  You can connect the Flex to external speakers via aux cable or Bluetooth.I purchased this with the nightlight attachment to use in the master bath with a waterproof Bluetooth speaker.  It suits that purpose quite well.  It replaced my old nightlight, so now I have Alexa access, a nightlight, and a USB charger in a single outlet and device, all with no wires or counter space used.  Great if you have a smaller vanity!  It's also great for hallways because again, no wires and no need for something to set it on.The Flex and the nightlight attachment both set themselves up. If you've previously saved your wifi info to your Amazon account, just plug it in and it does the setup for you.I can see the motion sensor being incredibly useful for kicking off Routines, but figured my dog would be tripping it all the time.  For that reason, I didn't add one to the Flex for the hallway.
",0.91980367919,electronics," I use it outside in my caport to control all my exterior lights - I can do it from my phone, but that's a pain, especially if I am dirty, have my hands full, etc.  I can get my outside lights on with ease, and I can still get time temp, time, weather, or place calls from it by just telling it to call someone on my contact list or just spout out the number.  It has bluetooth which I have not tried, but also a 3.5mm headphone jack so I could hook it to a speaker with ease.

Also if I want to know the weather or if I have a question in general works great. I can play music on it but it's not great for sound, but I don't think that was the intent for this. If your buying it for higher quality sound get a Echo Studio - High-fidelity smart speaker with 3D audio and Alexa. Or pair it up with a Bluetooth speaker or use the 3.5 mm audio jack and hook it to your stereo. I did the drop in with an echo dot in the house and it worked great. I could hear them clearly and they could hear me, which is nice if someone needs me they can drop in on the garage. I also have a camera in the garage so I can also see and now talk to whoever is there. Overall I'm happy with it.

I like the Ultra for the Ethernet port, sd card slot, and tv controls on the remote. The 2019 model adds a mute button, and two two personal shortcut buttons. You have to use the voice command on the remote to set the two shortcut buttons as it is not an option in the settings to set this up via the menu.

The Roku did not recognize my 64GB micro sd card. It did for my 32GB micro sd card. Which is still way overkill. You really only need a 2GB sd card for just apps. If you're a gamer and downloading games then a bigger sd card might be required.One plus is the buttons on the 2018/2017 were noisy with the clacking when pushed. The 2019 remote buttons are not quiet but they are less noisy in comparison. If the new additions of the remote appeal to you then it is great buy. If you have the 2018 model and you don't need the additions you can stay as is as the 2019 model is not a significant performance boost that will wow you. If you have an older Roku and do not need the additions of the 2019 then get the 2018 or 2017 model as its price will be reduced soon to clear its inventory.
",0.86405897120,electronics,"The 2019 Roku Ultra was a huge step up from our six year old Roku 3.  Set-up is super easy simply by following the clear Quick Start Guide and then the on-screen prompts.  If you have had Rokus in the past, all of your existing apps will download as part of setup.  Unfortunately, you will also get a bunch of other apps in the process too.  You will have to delete these one by one.  You will also have to re-sign in to each of your subscription services.  This is tedious, but I suppose it's necessary for security reasons.  In operation, boot-up, navigation and app loading were all faster than on our old Roku.  Voice search and the ability to control basic TV functions from the remote are nice conveniences.  A new feature that I particularly like is the presence of two programmable buttons on the remote.  These can be set up to perform any function that can be done with voice search.  I programmed ours to launch the two apps we use the most.I have one major complaint about the remote, though.  The mute button is placed on the side of the remote at a point where my hand naturally wraps around.  [See photo]  I found it almost impossible to pick up or hold the remote without inadvertently muting my TV sound.  At first I thought this was due to having small hands, but my husband, whose hands are considerably bigger than mine, experienced the same problem.  I ended up retrofitting the remote by fitting a square of thick interfacing leftover from a craft project around the button and securing it with duct tape.  [See other photo]  Not pretty, but it has prevented accidental muting while still giving access to the button with the press of a pinkie finger.  I dinged my rating by one star because of the mute issues.  Otherwise, this device is a full-on winner, and highly recommended, especially to streaming viewers who, like me, want an Ethernet connected device for optimal performance.
",0.8065524120,electronics,"Note: this review is based on two days of use. Things I like include the ease of set up, automatically connecting to TV  power, sound and mute. We're running an HDMI cord straight into the TV and the TV is connected by the HDMI ARC outlet to an AVR sound system. Power button turns off both the TV and AVR which is a plus for me. While I decided to use a wired connection, on day 1 we connected wirelessly and the unit connected easily and quickly with a strong signal. All of this has made our decision to get rid of cable all the easier. Using a combination of Hulu, Philo, Netflix and Prime we have access to our local channels, sports and movies while saving 90 to 100 dollars per month. The Roku allows us to use guides easier and quicker than the native TV smart connection. Like I said, the 1 remote is a huge plus. Not sure I'll ever use the headphone jack but do need to figure out how to program the 2 programmable buttons. While likely get a second one for our bedroom.
",0.96066319920,electronics,"So far, I haven’t noticed much difference between this 2019 model & the 2018. The remote is problematic- sometimes I hit a button & it performs the action incorrectly. I dislike the location of the mute button - it’s located on the side, right where my fingers touch it accidentally when holding the remote. So far I see no reason to upgrade to the 2019 Ultra.

",0.90466350320,electronics,"The unit arrived and appeared to be new.  I set it up and it was easy.  Started watching a movie and an hour later it lost the internet connection never to connect again.  All my other items still worked on my internet, reset the router, that didnt make any difference.I bought the extended warranty and called Amazon for service (since they say on the item that tech support is included).  There answer was to turn the unit off and on again, which I had already done.  Then they had me restart the router, it didnt work.  THEN they wanted me to call Roku to see if they could help.  One of the reasons I bought it from Amazon was they said they would support the item.I demanded another unit, which they said they would ship.  Then for some reason the tech said my address had been deactivated by Amazon WHAT?? I said, you shipped me two items today at that address.  After refusing to give my credit card to the agent she said she talked to her supervisor and she had read her screen incorrectly.So I will see when I receive my next one if it works for more than one hour.This is an update.  After researching the item I discovered it lost its MAC address.  So no matter what I did it would not connect to anything.  No luck from Roku support, that is a joke.  I got an email from them asking if the problem is resolved.  When I tried to answer the email it said my service ticket is closed.  Really....
",0.06857603820,electronics,"I have a Roku 3 and when I was online shopping for more streaming devices, I saw the pre-order for this updated Roku Ultra. I decided to go for it. Besides the faster processing time and internal data storage space ( compared to what I already had), I liked the idea that the remote had two programmable buttons. Seriously, the remote is probably what really drew me in. There's actually nothing wrong with my Roku 3 (it's still working like new), I just shifted it to another television because our household recently became cable free. To be honest, I expect this player to last just as long as the one I already have. I had researched a lot of different players before this purchase. I decided to stay with Roku after purchasing a Fire Stick for another television. During my research, I noticed that people were having lag issues with the 2018 version. That was a concern of mine buying this one. I've had no issues like that so far with the 2019 version. Overall, this was a great purchase.
",0.86066317620,electronics,"The Roku Ultra 2019 version is the best Roku experience I've ever had.Short list of features in the 2019 Ultra over other models: 4K streaming, lowest loading time on apps, accepts media on USB thumb drives, remote finder, television volume mute, headphone port for private listening, two voice buttons to save common commands.Versions: Regardless of how they're marketed Roku really has 3 major versions that matter. The first is a basic streaming stick, which is fine for people who want to try the service for the first time. The second is a premium streaming stick with volume control for your TV. This allows you to use only one remote for all your streaming, and I recommend this as the real entry point if price isn't your top concern. The third version is a home hub with volume control. The Ultra is the hub model, and it's definitely a premium experience that you only pay more for when you're sure you love this ecosystem.Why I upgraded: I was already happy with a premium Roku stick with television volume, so upgrading to the ""best"" version was eventually going to happen. The Ultra 2019 offers a mute control - instead of having to hold the volume down. It also has the remote finder, and better load times. Although I won't use it often, the private listening feature (plug headphones into the remote) could be nice if someone takes a midday nap. I was also having problems because my old Roku was sitting very close to my router. There's a technical problem where the Roku remote can have a hard time finding the stick due to the interference if the router is totally overpowering their signal. The Ultra 2019 has never had any issues, thanks to improvements in how they connect. If this ever happens to you, you could just run an HDMI cable to move your stick to the other side of the TV and it should be fine, but I was ready to upgrade anyway.What you get: Roku Ultra hub, power cable, ""premium"" headphones, and the flagship remote. No HDMI cable is included, so you'll have to supply your own.Roku Ultra Hub: Not only does it output HDMI, but it also accepts a USB input. You should research USB compatibility online as only certain file types are supported. The hub also has a remote finder, which causes your remote to emit a chirp until you press a button. The remote finder really says a lot about the Ultra - it's all about the experience. App loading time is better than other models, but not hugely so. The Ultra might save you a few seconds here and there.Ultra Remote 2019: The new Ultra remote has all the bells and whistles. Like any Roku, it connects to the hub via wifi so you don't even have to point it at the TV. To actually control your TV - now including power, volume, and mute - it has an infrared blaster you do have to point at the TV. Pairing to my hub and TV were both automatically done during setup, and all my settings and apps were imported thanks to my Roku account, so setup is a snap.""Premium"" JBL Headphones: Garbage. Throw them away and use anything else. These are the sort of terrible headphones you find at a gas station. Tinny and cheap. Roku really need to up their game here, and JBL need to stop calling these premium.Roku experience: I primarily use YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and an independent channel called OSI 74. All the apps load quickly, and are updated regularly. This isn't like an old Smart TV where half the apps fail to connect. My years-old Roku stick was still connecting to everything just fine, and I upgraded for other reasons. Roku rarely stops updating a stick, and even when they do, the new models offer so many features that the upgrade is worth it (like adding television volume control to the remote). Even when I connected a sound bar to my television, the Roku works seamlessly over HDMI, so the volume button on my Roku remote controls the volume on my sound bar without me having to do anything to configure it.Overall: I have a one-remote experience across all my most-used apps. Load times are great, and when errors happen - streaming services are always making little updates that can cause problems - I can count on Roku to update their apps fairly rapidly to match. Overall, in terms of just turning on my TV and watching the content I want to see, Roku is incredible. I prefer it over other devices - such as similar apps on game consoles or Smart TVs - thanks to frequent updates and overall experience. Roku also offers some bonuses, such as the Roku channels (I love OSI 74) and for instance this Halloween they updated their Roku channel with Halloween-themed movies and TV shows that were free to watch. Neat.

I've tried paying close attention to an around about time I've been falling asleep when I'm waking up to see how accurate the sleep tracker really is and it has been spot on for the past 4 nights. Also, for wearing the watch for the past 4 days and with actively using my watch it is sitting at 84% battery life. The watch is easy to use and set up. I love that you can go into the app and custom your watch setting, like daily limits and activities you want to record. You can also set up a reminder for your watch to buzz you and remind you to get up and be active. Another great thing about the watch is the ability to control your music from the watch and to be able to check your notifications.

The charger is magnetic and feels really solid and well engineered. It came fully charged and my husband and I have been wearing them for over eight hours. Both of our watches are still at 90-93% level battery.Edited to add: holy cow this watch's battery life is amazing! We haven't charged it in 15 days and I'm still at 38%. If you use the turn on every time I twist my arm setting it'll kill the battery just a little faster. My husband needed to charge for the first time today.My only complaint is that if you take it off during nighttime it'll count that time as sleep, even though you're not sleeping and you can't adjust the begin time manually. I wish I could choose which ""awake"" time it starts from or that if it didn't have a heart rate it didn't log anything. Instead of it just counting the time I was rubbing my husband's back of as sleeping time weirdly.Edit two: it's the 30th and the last time I charged mine was on the 11th. I'm still at 22% battery life. I'm gonna see if it'll live for an entire month. Also, I knock it on stuff all the time because I'm clumsy; and it is super sturdy and well made.

",0.76619434425,electronics,"Updated Review on Oct 6, 2019:After nearly a year of using it, I noticed that the issues I mentioned in the original review were largely negligible while reading. The pinhole near the corner was never bothersome because I'd have to remember to look very closely to see it. The battery can last for a long time during hibernation, even for many many weeks if not used. I also hardly remember to notice the uneven screen color temperature. The only thing that's still a bit inconvenient is the glare. When near a window I'd have to adjust my reading angle to avoid the glare. It's something hard to overcome with a digital device and it's not a big compromise for light-weight and convenience. Therefore please take my original review below with a grain of salt, I was nitpicking on a device that I had a lot of expectations for. I also decided to change the 3 stars to 4 stars.Original review on Nov 12, 2018 (with updates on Jan 26, 2019):I have owned a Kindle Paperwhite since 2014. I really liked that old one and gifted it away a while ago. Perhaps I have had too much expectation for this new 2018 version (waited for many months for the release), I felt quite disappointed with a few of its issues.First I must be clear that I am a fan of e-books, and I think Kindle Paperwhite has always been a nice device, light, easy to use, easier on the eyes than an LCD screen, easy to look up words, etc. I also used a Kindle Oasis for a couple of days, I don't feel comfortable with the hard slick aluminum back, and its front lights are located on the sides, so the slight uneven light can be observed from left to right; while for Paperwhite with bottom lights, the unevenness is from top to bottom, meaning within each text line, the light is usually even, therefore less distracting to reading.Here comes the new 2018 Paperwhite:I like the screen is flat with the bezels now. However, both the first device I received and the subsequent replacement have a bright pinhole dot under the screen (see photos). It's like a piece of tiny defect or dust above the e-ink text and located in the light distribution layer (my guess). When the front light is adjusted to a high level, the dot becomes quite bright and distracting. I was surprised the second device had the same issue (just my luck or something else is going on here?), but because it's near the corner, I decided to live with it. This pinhole bright spot issue apparently can be found on the previous generations as well based on many reviews, I am just astonished Amazon hasn't fixed it.Also, I don't know what happened with the charging cable, it took me a lot of effort to plug it into the device, and pull it out, it's like as if the connectors are not made well.(Update Jan 26, 2019: the difficulty of plugging in the cable only occurred during the first couple of uses, it became normal and smooth later.)Also, the screen feels easier to smudge than my old Paperwhite. The texts appear slightly blurrier where there are fingerprints.Another issue is that the screen has a ton of reflection from bright windows or light sources (please see my photo, taken under an east-facing window in the afternoon). I don’t remember if it has always been like this or it’s because of the new screen update. Even with the window blinds shut, I had to tilt Kindle to certain angles to avoid the glare, albeit softer than on an LCD screen, still quite distracting. Under the same lighting, a real paperback has no reflection glare issues.Furthermore, when front light is on and when external ambient light is somewhat dim, my replacement Kindle Paperwhite appears a bit yellower near the bottom, especially on the left side, it’s distracting but hopefully, I’ll get used to it. It’s like real paper books getting old and parts of pages turning yellow—I try to convince myself.(Update Jan 26, 2019: other reviewers have mentioned issues with poor battery life. My experience is similar that if I don't use it for a few hours, even with WiFi turned on, the device will enter something like a hibernation mode, which requires a bit more time to wake up, but it allows the battery to last for many weeks if left on the shelf. If I read about 1-2 hours a day with wifi on, the battery drains very quickly, and will hardly last beyond a week. However, If you keep airplane mode on during reading, it will significantly conserve battery, the only inconvenience is that if you don't know a word and the dictionary also doesn't have it, which is quite likely the case, Wikipedia won't be able to show up without WiFi.)Perhaps I’m just asking too much for a digital device. Overall, it’s still a great device to read books, and Amazon still provided a fast replacement when I asked. However, with these experiences, I can no longer swear to e-readers. I don’t write reviews often, but I feel strongly about this product and sincerely hope it will help fellow costumers and help Amazon improve their devices.
",0.05769711725,electronics,"If you own an earlier Paperwhite and it's still functional there is no compelling reason to buy the Gen 4 ""All-New"" Paperwhite ( Amazon misleadingly refers to this as ""10th Generation"". It's a 10th generation Kindle e-reader but only the 4th generation Paperwhite ) unless a limited degree of water resistance (not waterproof as they claim) is important to you or you want Bluetooth capability for Audiobooks. Neither of these are remotely important nor needed by me in an e-reader and Audiobooks are handled better by smaller, lighter and less power hungry devices. The additional storage is coals to Newcastle as Amazon's cloud can hold any overstorage needs an owner has. Personally, I don't know anyone who has ever run out of onboard storage on any Kindle, including the very first keyboard models, despite loading them with hundreds of books. The much touted, by Amazon, thinness and lightness of this edition is, in my opinion, overblown. Yes it is slightly thinner and slightly lighter but not paradigm changing. Also beware: the supplied micro USB cable packaged with mine will not fit into the device, maybe yours will. All in all I find it breathtakingly stupid and/or venal of Amazon to ship a device so poorly engineered and quality controlled as to not have a functional charging cable. I bought this Kindle solely to replace a Gen 3 whose battery was failing. Amazon took every other Paperwhite edition off the website and left no choice but this one at $10 more than the previous edition. It's a Kindle, it's fine, but it's no game changer. If you buy it thinking it is I think you'll be disappointed.
",0.06479641825,electronics,"I love Kindle, have always had one since the first edition.  This is my third PaperWhite version of the Kindle.  The battery life is non-existent.  If you leave the WiFi option on, it drains the battery life within 9-10 hours even if you are not using the device.  If you disable the WiFi, the battery life lasts a bit longer (approx 3-days) using the device 2-3 hours a day.  The low rating is because of the very low battery life and inability to keep WiFi on all the time.  Otherwise, my Kindle is my best friend.  I most likely will return it because of the lack of battery longevity.
",0.02740696125,electronics,"I feel I need to approach this review from 2 perspectives:1. If you are somewhat new to the Kindle experience and you bought this one.2. If you are a previous Kindle or Paperwhite owner and upgraded to this one.If you are NEW TO THE EXPERIENCE or upgrading from an old Kindle like a Keyboard, welcome. This new Kindle merits 5 stars. You're going to love it. Here are some Kindle Paperwhite features you'll enjoy:* Built in light. Reading in bed while someone is trying to sleep next to you is now an easy joy.* Touch screen. Getting around your Kindle is easy. Turn pages, shop in the store, all by touching the screen.* Waterproof. This is a new feature to this Kindle. Bring it in the pool worry free!* Bluetooth. Sync this up with a speaker or headphones to have a book read to you.Besides that, this Kindle is thin and light. It doesn't fatigue your hand at all. The fonts are adjustable for size. The light is adjustable for brightness. The color of the light is somewhat grayish. My older Paperwhite had the blueish hue which I found a little unnatural. I bought the Amazon case and when you close the cover the Kindle automatically sleeps and when you open the cover it automatically wakes up. I find this Kindle to be a little faster than the previous version. If this is your first Paperwhite there is only reason to be content with your purchase.Now, if you are UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER PAPERWHITE I'd still be happy (I'm still glad I did upgrade) but there were a few things that made me go hmmmm.First off I expected this Kindle to have the latest software. It didn't. I'm waiting for the update where the home page scrolls and you could save font themes. Why doesn't a brand new Kindle not have the latest software? Not a deal breaker because I know the update will be coming, but my old Paperwhite was updated. Last time I checked the update page it didn't even show the update for this version. A little disappointing.Secondly, I had the Paperwhite from a few versions ago, the one with 212 ppi. Upgrading to this one with 300 ppi, I expected the font to be sharp, bold, and clear. Well, I'll just say that it didn't stink. Actually I found it to be a little greyed out, a little washed out to say it another way. Now, this is totally adjustable of course. The font could be bolded and size changed. But again, a little disappointed.The software is exactly the same as my older version, minus the upgrade of course. I wish Amazon would give us more fonts to choose from. I know that we could download fonts now but it would just be nice if they were built in to begin with.So my two biggest gripes are not shipped with the latest software and underwhelming font sharpness. From this perspective I'd give it a 3 1/2 or 4 star rating.But having said that I have no regrets upgrading at all. I would do it again. The Paperwhite experience in general is something I find amazing. When I'm finished with a book I go right to the store and check out samples, download free classics, or pull the trigger on a purchase based on my mood right then and there. I wouldn't trade it for anything.If you are new to Kindle or upgrading from a really old one don't let my gripes deter you. The Paperwhite is the gold standard of e-readers. At an affordable price you're getting this gold standard. And since this Kindle boasts being waterproof, bluetooth, being thinner and lighter, and with 8gb of storage, it's a no brainer.
",0.83450281625,electronics,"It’s infuriating that Amazon went to market with this machine. Do not upgrade from prior Paperwhites.1. To unlock the device, it goes through a long “waking up” period where the backlight is turned up full blast for some reason. It then reverts to your normal backlight setting after unlocking. I blind myself every night reading in bed. All previous Paperwhites unlocked instantly, with no dumb backlight. After you lock it, it will unlock instantly again for a few minutes afterward, so it seems to be “going to sleep” in some deeper way — probably to save battery life.2. It is not significantly lighter, but it is just SLIGHTLY smaller so that it doesn’t fit in the old Paperwhite cases. They obviously did this just to force you to buy a new case. Even worse, there are hardly any cases that fit this design—even from Amazon.3. The battery life is bad, possibly because of the Bluetooth connection. You can turn it off in the settings menu with the WiFi, but it’s disappointing that they only added a feature by making battery life worse AND adding that stupid “waking up” process.Pros:Yes, it’s waterproof—although I mainly go it to stop dog hair being caught in the screen edges. The Bluetooth feature for audible does work, although it’s not better in any way than using your phone.It seems to have more precise control over the backlight brightness... after it wakes up and blinds you.Bottom line: this is not a finished product, and they shoved it out the door because they wanted to have it out for Christmas.
",0.02335837525,electronics,"This is my fourth Kindle. I started with the classic, moved to the one with a keyboard, and then the Paperwhite, and now the Paperwhite 2.0. I've now had it for five days. When I got it, I fully charged it.I haven't tested this in water, so the only thing I can put in the pros column is the increased storage. Otherwise, it seems exactly the same as the original Paperwhite. I don't want to return the device because I can work around the issues, but I also don't want to give it a great rating given the issues I've seen so far - hence the three stars.**Issues I had with the original Paperwhite that persist with this version:**1. Occasionally unresponsive screen. When pressing to go forward or back, the device will sometimes freeze for a second before performing the required command. Based on other reviews, I can only assume this is a device issue. I was hoping it would be fixed with this version, but apparently not.2. Battery doesn't meet marketing claims. I'll be clear upfront: I read a lot, and I read fast. I average three to five books a week, depending on the length of the book. 30% of my reading is done on my phone via Kindle app, and the other 70% is done on my Kindle.Amazon claims ""battery lasts weeks."" If you don't use the device, that may be true. If you do, though, I'd say it lasts about a week. In the five days I've had this device, I've spent about twenty hours reading on it. The battery is half gone, so I assume its full life is 40 hours. Not bad - if the marketing claim said that the battery lasts a week (singular). Again, not enough to make me return the device, but it's annoying - especially given the increased price.**Issues I had with the original Paperwhite that I haven't experienced with this version:**1. Struggling to open large documents or books and occasionally crashing and freezing when getting too far into the document.2. Slowing down when more books were downloaded. It performed best when only 8-10 books were downloaded on the device at a time and the others were cleared out.3. Fully charged battery running out after six consecutive hours of reading, requiring a recharge (annoying, given the ""weeks"" statement when it didn't even last a day).I'll update this review later to confirm if these last issues are resolved with this new version or if they crop up after more use.
",0.04883950925,electronics,"After almost 4 years what do we get? Nothing of practical use. Is 8gb of storage really necessary? Of course not, unless you have 10,000 side-loaded books that will take you 20 years to read. Waterproof? After 10 years of owning Kindles I’ve never needed it. So unless you’re Michael Phelps or love to read underwater with goggles on its not necessary. Bluetooth? Does a real book have bluetooth? Worse yet, there is no immersive reading so it’s pointless....Why is this the the worst Paperwhite yet?It feels flimsy and hollow. It still has the same design as the original Paperwhite, you know the one released back in 2012 which makes it 6 years old. It still has the same Dinosaur bezels and now attracts more reflection, smudges and fingerprints than ever before. There is so much glare on this thing my girlfriend uses it to put make-up on. No but seriously a more appropriate name would have been the ""Kindle Refection"" or the ""Kindle Pinhole"" due to going through three different exchanges due to pinholes and dead pixels. It's sad. In my opinion, the previous Paperwhite 3 is better with the paper-like feel of the screen, it also has no glare and much better contrast and clarity. The new Paperwhite suffers from this as well as the dull and uneven lighting as seen in the picture. It also feels cheaply made and you can tell Amazon cut corners in assembly. As an example, the Voyage is also lighter but feels sturdy and solid in the hand whereas the new Paperwhite feels empty. Needless to say this new release is a major disappointment, but thats what happens when Amazon has no competition, the customer is the one to suffer. We all lose. Amazon is not innovating, they are not doing anything to improve the Kindle in practical ways that matter. More storage, waterproof and bluetooth are all gimmicks that the 99.9% of us don’t need. Its all a marketing scam.What would have been nice is page turn buttons, less monstrous bezels, less glare, and Comfort light (the adjustment of color temperature for nighttime reading). Even the Glowlight 3 has it, and it’s 2 year old technology. Side by side this Paperwhite is worst in every way that matters next to my Paperwhite 3. I'm just disgusted with Amazon right now for slacking and making us wait so long for a mediocre device. Lastly, what is up with the White Logo? Talk about distracting! Amazon went black on black with the Paperwhite 3 to avoid distractions and allow for a more immersive reading experience. To go back to a white distracting logo makes absolute no sense. Why Amazon? Here is a side by side picture of the new Paperwhite 4 which should be adequately named (on the left) and the superior Paperwhite 3 (on the right). The choice is clear.
",0.06323641525,electronics,"I am an avid reader and adore the new paperwhite!  To me, it’s the perfect reader. No light bleed thru, easy to control the amount of backlight, easy to download books and simply just easy to read my books.  It did not come with the very latest software uploaded but within 24 hours of being connected to my WiFi, the kindle updated itself.  Honestly, I’ve never purchased a smart phone that didn’t need an update within minutes of activation...Android or Apple.Using overdrive on my phone or tablet, it’s easy to borrow books and return books from my library. The newest update allows you to return right from your paperwhite and that is a huge improvement. As a prime member, I get a free book every month plus I follow several emails that alert to free or greatly discounted books.  8 GB of storage is way more than enough for me.  I find the weight to be significantly less than a paperback even with a case.  I am happy with this purchase!

This one will no longer hold a charge.
",0.0623160325,electronics,"My Kindle Voyage developed pinhole light bleeding so I decided to trade it in for $50 and a discount on a new Kindle.  First, I bought the Oasis - what a total disappointment!  High price and yet awkward to hold, awkward dimensions, horrendous battery life (mere hours), slow to boot up and lousy cover options.  Back it went.  I wasn't about to shell out a premium price for the exact same (old) Voyage tech and the Paperwhite was too big a downgrade (and ALSO long in tooth), so I held off on choosing a replacement.  I was very disappointed when all they came out with is this new Paperwhite, but I got it anyway.  At this point I'll stick with it, but if I could go back, I'd get a Kobo.This newest Paperwhite is ""meh.""  It's OK.  But it's only OK.  No night mode like the Kobo.  Light, but too small and very cheap feeling.  Case is the same overly expensive price, but feels and looks cheaper than the older Paperwhite cases (Hubby still has his 2nd Gen Paperwhite) - they even omitted the little silver tag on the cover, which jazzed it up a bit.  Like the Oasis, the newest Kindle Paperwhite takes several seconds to turn on - it's bad enough even my husband commented on it when we compared devices.  What on earth are they doing to make these SLOWER than old models?  How do they think people will find this acceptable?  My Surface Pro 4 runs an actual Windows 10 operating system and it boots at least as fast - faster than the Oasis.  Yes, the new Paperwhite is waterproof, but I've never NEEDED waterproofing, so I don't really care.  Backlight is OK but nothing special.  Screen is the same old epaper screen.The new Paperwhite isn't truly bad and it's definitely not great...it's just ""OK"".  It's DEFINITELY preferable to the Oasis.  If you aren't committed to the Amazon ecosystem for books, I'd suggest you check out Kobo or some other ereader brand, instead.  Amazon seems to be really missing the mark with their ereaders these days and it's truly disappointing.
",0.06565469526,electronics,"For the price, this is an excellent Chromebook. After opening the box, I've done my fair share of research.1. Solid build at an undefeatable price. Not many things you can do now for 110 bucks. A full tank gas for my SUV costs more than that.2. USB type C port, SD card slot, and USB 3.03. 4 gigs of RAM is good though the 16gb memory is not enough, just insert $3 32gb micros sd card, it is much better than spend $100 more for a 64gb disk. With 20 bucks, we can make it 144GB. Why buy more expensive one. Besides, you have google cloud free for you.5. Nice feel to the keyboard and track pad.6.

",0.05782234727,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.08309632527,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971527,electronics,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.

",0.84786665428,electronics,"About two years ago, I bought and reviewed (here on Amazon) the Xbox One S Limited edition Gears of War 4 console. After time had passed by and feeling the need to play some games in either 4K or 60FPS (Witcher 3, Gears 5, RDR2, etc.) I decided I wanted to pick up an Xbox One X. What a coincidence that 2 years later they would bring out a Limited edition Gears of War 5 console when I was already looking to pick one up, so of course I preordered.Let me start by saying that the first thing that jumped out to me was that this consoles box is the same exact size as the Xbox One S box, and the way the console is packaged is exactly the same, which is fine because it's quick and easy to open (Especially compared so my Spider-Man PS4 Pro Console).  Comparing this side by side to the Gears 4 console, the design is less aggressive and more subtle then the Gears 4 console which was flaming red all over (as well as the controller) but there are some thing I prefer more about this console, I love the Translucent Cog logo on the console and the design underneath the console of the Locust Symbol as well as the Black/gold look of the bottom, it's eye catching.So let's talk about what comes in the box? You get the Gears Console, Limited Edition Controller,  Gears 5 Ultimate download code, Xbox Live 1 Month Free Trial, and Xbox Game Pass 1 Month Free Trial. It's actually a lot of content and when you factor in you're only paying $100 more than a regular Xbox One X this proves to be a good value. Overall, I am satisfied and would buy this again, it gives you the most powerful console currently available with the Ultimate Edition of Microsoft's Flagship title.
",0.528,electronics," Just got the Xbox one x after preordering it and it is looking good so far. As you can see it comes with the Kait Diaz controller, Xbox stand, and on the right is a 1 month game pass trial, 1 month gold, and digital codes for all the gears games.The game pass trial code is of course useless if you already have game pass. If you have GP Ultimate like I do then the 1 month Xbox live gold will convert to 20 days of GP Ultimate which is actually not bad.As for the digital codes, it comes with all the gears games except Judgment (lmao rip), and for some reason the gears 5 ultimate edition and gears of war 4 are in the same code so you can’t redeem one without redeeming the other. Sort of a weird choice since I already have gow 4 and I was hoping to just give it away. And just FYI the code for Gears of War 1 will be for the ultimate edition and not the original Gears of War.Also included a video showing the startup and shutdown sounds for the Xbox One X. I have not played gears 5 yet so maybe it is a reference to the game? Not sure but I own the gow4 Xbox one S and honestly I preferred those custom sounds.Overall it looks pretty good and I’m excited to start gaming on it.
",0.95547729728,electronics,"This has to be the best console I have ever owned 2019. The sheer amazement in the design work is literally breathtaking. Sony needs to step up the game when it comes to designing. I am not a gears fan whatsoever and got this mainly for the design. I have played a couple of games on it, and it really puts the PlayStation to shame. Sadly there isn’t a lot of exclusive games for Xbox, but when I got done playing and switched to PS4, it was a huge disappointing difference. One I never noticed or knew before. I stick with both systems now, but a reason for the one star dinged off. The controller had a scuff mark on the back, and the system itself has issues to where the audio stops working and you have to restart the system multiple times if running more than one app. Overall, a great console.
",0.0442517428,electronics,"As a huge fan of all things Gears, I was so stoked when they announced this console. Every detail mentioned in previous media for it is there: the omen shrouded under multiple layers of epoxy, giving it the look of being buried under the ice; the laser etching across the face, emulating cracks; the start up and down sounds of crackling ice sheets, invoking a frozen tundra. The console, just as the Gears 4 Swarm Xbox 1 S, is flawless. If you wanted to nitpick, there are a few details. The console comes with the ultimate edition of Gears 5, digital of course, but it also comes with a month of Xbox game pass, a subscription service that itself includes the ultimate edition. The only difference is the console includes arctic skins for Kait and Jack. Considering that game pass is also running a two months for two bucks deal, it just seems a bit cheesy to have a copy of the game as well as a sub service that includes the same version for so cheap that everyone has it. Also, though the console is superb, I'd hoped the startup sounds contained a bit more visual flair. In the same way Gears 4 emulated Gears 1 with a bombastic soundtrack, Gears 5 seems to mirror Gears 2 with a bit more of a mysterious tinge. Both of these themes bleed into the console noises - where Gears 4's console got the sound of a Juvie screeching and some nice trumpeting soundtrack beats, this console instead features the ice crackling heavily, and a slight string note that is reminiscent of Gears 2's soundtrack during the New Hope Research Facility section: mysterious and intriguing. All in all though, this package is well worth the money.

Seriously Microsoft, with the next console make the battery emedded and rechargeable, batteries for consoles should've disappeared during the Xbox 360 era.

",0.96749675329,electronics,"I've used tiles for a few years now.  I consider them to be a vital product, because I can be somewhat forgetful, and lose track of small (or even not so small) objects.  So the ability to find your keys, or wallet, or purse or whatever, is a tremendous help.The way it works is pretty cool, you put a tile on your object that you are worried about losing, and then you load the tile app on your phone.  Your phone periodically monitors your tile objects and keeps track of them.  Then when you tell the app to locate your object, it will try to connect to it via bluetooth.  If it is able to connect, it does, and it plays a sound, helping you locate it.  If it can't connect, it shows you where (on a map) it was last able to connect to it, so for example if you left it at work, and you are now at home, you'll know that you left it at work.  Pretty neat!That said, this product has definitely gotten worse this year.  Now when you try to locate an object that you've had in your possession, say earlier in the day, and it's not nearby and you try to locate it, it'll tell you about where it was a month ago or some such.  It's essentially worthless now for what was a really useful use case.  It's now still very useful for locating things that are nearby, but if it's not nearby, it's no longer helpful imo.

It only works if location services are turned to always, even thought when traveling out of wifi range, this puts a huge load on the phone battery (you use a mobile app to find out where your keys are).  Since adding this app, and activating my tile, my battery life has shot down.  If I change location services to ""when using the app"" it tells me that my tile has been disabled. This needs to be fixed--much of the time we don't need our locations tracked since the tile is immobile, or we know exactly where the object is.

In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.08309632530,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.

",0.20888653432,electronics,"I've used tiles for a few years now.  I consider them to be a vital product, because I can be somewhat forgetful, and lose track of small (or even not so small) objects.  So the ability to find your keys, or wallet, or purse or whatever, is a tremendous help.The way it works is pretty cool, you put a tile on your object that you are worried about losing, and then you load the tile app on your phone.  Your phone periodically monitors your tile objects and keeps track of them.  Then when you tell the app to locate your object, it will try to connect to it via bluetooth.  If it is able to connect, it does, and it plays a sound, helping you locate it.  If it can't connect, it shows you where (on a map) it was last able to connect to it, so for example if you left it at work, and you are now at home, you'll know that you left it at work.  Pretty neat!That said, this product has definitely gotten worse this year.  Now when you try to locate an object that you've had in your possession, say earlier in the day, and it's not nearby and you try to locate it, it'll tell you about where it was a month ago or some such.  It's essentially worthless now for what was a really useful use case.  It's now still very useful for locating things that are nearby, but if it's not nearby, it's no longer helpful imo.

Since adding this app, and activating my tile, my battery life has shot down.  If I change location services to ""when using the app"" it tells me that my tile has been disabled.

",0.21858209433,electronics," Coming from a Fire HD 7, then a ""Kids"" Kindle 8, this is really an impressive and welcome upgrade.So I really want, and need, to explain that the only difference between the ""kids edition"" and the regular one, other than price, is that the ""kids edition"" comes with--A kidproof case (and this one even has a kickstand!!) Which yes, the kindle kid cases are amazing with protection.-The year of Free Time, which is the kids gaming platform.-The 2 year replacement guarantee (that I have used in the past for a broken screen. SUPER easy process. You have to CALL Amazon to do this, it cannot be done via your order page; Return the kindle without case to Amazon, they ship you a replacement kindle without the case.)O N L Y differences. So when I see all of these negative reviews about the kids kindle, then I jump over to the positive reviews on the normal kindle, it's baffling. And I did compare the two because it's a $50 price difference, and what really sold this version for me, rather than buying everything separately, was the 2 year replacement guarantee.My child started out with my Fire HD 7, which you can switch between adult and kid profiles on as well. Any kindle can be a kids kindle as long as you've got a childs profile set up. Once she got bigger/older, we bought her the kids edition 8. So the kids edition 10 is her Christmas gift this year. It's so much faster than the 8, obviously bigger. And I loved that with having it connected to my account before shipment, setup was fast-All the hard work was done and I just had to select a pin for this device, it was set up and ready to go within 10 minutes. Memory card slot on the side, removal and replacement of the case is MUCH easier than on the 8. The volume on this thing is loud, crisp, and clear.With the 10, the only differences I've noticed that would be worth mentioning is that usually on the other kindles, you would pull down the settings bar to click on the icon and switch profiles. With this one it seems you've got to lock, click the icon, then switch profiles. Not a big deal to me and I'm sure it wont be to her. She uses my profile for regular youtube and roblox, just normal things that aren't accessible on the kids/free time dashboard. Other difference here is that it now uses a USBC charger, which is another positive since every phone in my house uses USBC so it's easier to replace and keep up with.The free time dashboard. Lots of negative feedback on that one; So sometime ago, maybe in the last year or 2 I think, free time had an update. I HATED the update.

",0.22250366236,electronics," Coming from a Fire HD 7, then a ""Kids"" Kindle 8, this is really an impressive and welcome upgrade.So I really want, and need, to explain that the only difference between the ""kids edition"" and the regular one, other than price, is that the ""kids edition"" comes with--A kidproof case (and this one even has a kickstand!!) Which yes, the kindle kid cases are amazing with protection.-The year of Free Time, which is the kids gaming platform.-The 2 year replacement guarantee (that I have used in the past for a broken screen. SUPER easy process. You have to CALL Amazon to do this, it cannot be done via your order page; Return the kindle without case to Amazon, they ship you a replacement kindle without the case.)O N L Y differences. So when I see all of these negative reviews about the kids kindle, then I jump over to the positive reviews on the normal kindle, it's baffling. And I did compare the two because it's a $50 price difference, and what really sold this version for me, rather than buying everything separately, was the 2 year replacement guarantee.My child started out with my Fire HD 7, which you can switch between adult and kid profiles on as well. Any kindle can be a kids kindle as long as you've got a childs profile set up. Once she got bigger/older, we bought her the kids edition 8. So the kids edition 10 is her Christmas gift this year. It's so much faster than the 8, obviously bigger. And I loved that with having it connected to my account before shipment, setup was fast-All the hard work was done and I just had to select a pin for this device, it was set up and ready to go within 10 minutes. Memory card slot on the side, removal and replacement of the case is MUCH easier than on the 8. The volume on this thing is loud, crisp, and clear.With the 10, the only differences I've noticed that would be worth mentioning is that usually on the other kindles, you would pull down the settings bar to click on the icon and switch profiles. With this one it seems you've got to lock, click the icon, then switch profiles. Not a big deal to me and I'm sure it wont be to her. She uses my profile for regular youtube and roblox, just normal things that aren't accessible on the kids/free time dashboard. Other difference here is that it now uses a USBC charger, which is another positive since every phone in my house uses USBC so it's easier to replace and keep up with.The free time dashboard. Lots of negative feedback on that one; So sometime ago, maybe in the last year or 2 I think, free time had an update. I HATED the update. It jumbled literally everything together and she had to look for all of her downloaded games, just randomly clicking on everything. But this was a year or 2 ago and the dashboard on the 10 is no different than the dash on the 7 and 8. It's just the same free time update that's been there for a year or 2 now.She has an ipad air that we have her school apps on. They weren't available on kindle so we keep the ipad around for homework. She absolutely hates the ipad. So if your kid is an apple fan, they may not like this one.

",0.16686123637,electronics,"Pros:• This is a solid built machine. Very sturdy and no dust cracks, while retaining its simple form. One of the few times I can say you’re getting exactly what every picture on the web is showing.• I had the basic black design, but I do appreciate that Amazon is offering more colors rather than there basic set (even if it’s only a few generic colors).• The mute option is the most appreciative tool. When you activate it the classic blue glow will fall into the red, giving you the visual display that your privacy is being protected.• The sound performs exactly what it’s built for. I found no issue in testing in an open living room. The volume goes to great levels as once again, for a 360-degree smart speaker, Amazon reigns supreme.• Testing all ranges of music, I found that that bass to be rich and powerful. My colleague has the previous Echo Plus and she states that there is an improvement in the bass with this Echo. An overall rich sound when a piano came in and a warmer outcome when acoustics came into play (You’ll get the bass experience when you hit those hard beats).• Like any other model, the Bluetooth connectivity between a third party stereo works flawlessly. I tested this out with some Bose surround sound, and nothing but clear music. You can also pair the Echo if you have smaller / weaker speakers. Both together will pump up the experience.• The connectivity is so flawless that buying two of these devices (or use Echo’s previous versions, if you have one) and put them in separate locations doesn’t make this a bad idea. You’re going to get great quality in music without paying an am or a leg for it.• I have to appreciate Amazon for not pushing their music platform. They offer the usual Spotify (which I used) but also Apple Music, Deezer, TuneIn, even BBC sounds. You’re getting a lot more features than just a basic smart speaker.• Using Google Home for over a year I can say that just saying “Alexa” felt more natural than saying “Ok Google.” Not to mention having Alexa listen to me every time I said: “Alexa” (Google Home users will understand this).• Like before, smart applications fit like a glove in this system. I only used it for lights and the Echo was spot on. This feature is more common than ever on any smart speaker, and the Echo does what it’s supposed to do.• I admire the organization of the app because it’s your remote control on anything you want the Echo to do. Turn off lights, switch music, mute volume, install new features, and so forth. We all carry our phones like carrying our driver licenses when going outside. This day in age I’ll always prefer an app than a physical remote.• I did some Alexa calls on this and found only clear responses and answers (this will depend on your Wi-Fi).• I would give 70% of Alexa sounding more human.• Everything is in the cloud so, you don’t need to worry about manual updates. All taken care of.• As I mentioned before, everything else is the same in a smart speaker. Ask for the weather, traffic, upcoming appointments, and all other general questions. I didn’t test all of them because…well is the same technology as last year.• The biggest difference in my book is the price. Newer and cheaper.Cons and Oks:• No Zigbee controller. This isn’t much of an issue, but if you already have a smart house layout than you’ll need to spend some extra time configuring with the Echo. The issue for this is that it puts more work on the Echo than you need. Also, there may be some smart devices that won’t work on the Echo because of this. I know last year's models had some connectivity issues with Philips Hue bulbs. Keep an eye out for which smart devices are compatible with the Echo.• I did notice that the app slows down when you put a lot of apps and smart applications in the Echos. I tested a lot of features out that require a decent amount of downloads, but the results did create a delay in the app. I have to assume without Zigbee’s software, if you have a lot of smart applications connected to the Echo, and with the general apps you use, there will be a delay in the long run.• The Echo gets loud. Loud enough that you’ll get some distortion when you’re around 95% in volume. The effect is shown when a lot of bass is begin made. Please note that 90% and up is booming your entire house.• Compare to Google Home, Alexa still isn’t the brightest smart speak in the family. For the basic day to day task it works fine, but those random questions that we tend to have throughout the day Alexa doesn’t deliver. Alexa will usually provide you with a quick one-sentence summary (Unlike Google, it would provide you a short paragraph.). This issue doesn’t happen all the time, but you’ll notice it when it does.• I’m trying to learn Spanish, so asking smile Spanish questions with Alexa is not reliable. Example I will say “Alexa, what does “Qué estás haciendo” in Spanish mean (What are you doing?)? Alexa will say “What are you happy.” I’ve been studying for 6 moths so my speech on that sentence was spot on, but Alexa. Not a reliable study buddy.• I had the first version of the Echo and all I can say is I miss the rotation ring. Bring it back Amazon.• The design is nothing new. It’s built very solid, but it’s identical to Echo Plus 2. My colleague had the Echo Plus and putting them aside there was no way you can tell the difference (a nice note if you want to steal your friends and replace it with the last version).• Even the sound is almost similar to the previous Echo. Both are fantastic, but almost the same.Bottom Line:It’s a great smart speaker system, but almost identical in every way as its previous model. There is nothing wrong with that because Amazon does put in a lot of features into this Echo that makes this right in the top three (Google Home, HomePods, and the Echo Family). It’s accurate, excellent sound, and lower in price than its previous model.Some concerns are the effects in the long run with those who have a decent amount of smart applications, and making sure the compatibility can be performed accurately. Also knowing the limits of what Alexa can and can’t do as the hardware is identical to its previous version. I wouldn’t be surprised if you want to just read Echo’s previous model amazon reviews. Trust me when I say that they’re almost identical in sight and performance.In the end, the reason it doesn’t matter about the flaws is because the price is well worth what you’re getting. It’s a machine that I can see using it every day for the simplest things such as setting up an alarm to enjoying it in small parties. I will say that if you’re planning to use your surround sound stereo connected to this, then this is a must buy. You pay a heavy price for a HomePod, enjoy a generic performance for a Google Home, and are presented with an overall user-friendly experience with the Echo 3. Cheaper than its predecessor and the worth every penny.Overall: A tiny upgrade from its previous model, but still an excellent experience in sound for all.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer
",0.94468158537,electronics,"I purchased my first Alexa Echo 1st Gen two years ago and I fell in love right away! It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1.  This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons.

The addition of the powered Echo sub fills in the lows to make it an immersive experience.Setup was fairly easy.  My only complaint was that I had trouble renaming the 2nd Echo itself.

It can answer some simple questions with simple answers and do a few smart home things and has ""skills"" but that's about it. Isn't that enough? No, it isn't. I guess I thought I was getting something smart, something I could engage with, seek intelligent replies from, something connected to the world wide web of knowledge. Guess I was wrong. I got a stupid little automated squawk box; a borderline parrot. Guess I got bought. For all our great advances in technology, we're clearly still in our technological infancy. Get back to me when I can say ""Computer, describe to me quantum physics in layman's terms. Explain to me the theory of relativity. What exactly is gravity; are there gravity particles? What is the meaning of life?"" The answer to the latter better be: 42. Another big gripe is that it's constantly trying to sell me something -running through a whole dales pitch -instead of just doing or playing what I asked, or it tells me what it's about to do even though I just asked it exactly that.

",0.08730396638,electronics,"UPDATE OCT 29It's definitely not working consistently. Recently we went on vacation and I could not find my keys. Turns out they were right in my purse  which I was holding in my hand. When I opened the app which had been running in the background and pressed to find my keys, it said that I was out of range. I was certainly not out of range, it was only inches away. I was freaking out thinking I threw my keys in the trash when I finally found them in a zippered compartment. They never rang! I am not sure why I even keep this on my keys. Total waste!ORIGINAL REVIEWI was excited to try these Tiles with the app, to have a way to find our keys etc. I downloaded the app to my iPhone and found that the set up was rather easy, and at first everything went great.Then I let it sit for a minute and went to the app to find the keys which were sitting right beside me, and the tile app said that they were not in range. Ok that is disturbing. After looking around the app for awhile it just randomly started working again. I do not have any issues with any other things that connect via bluetooth so I found this odd.I tried downloading the app on my iPad to see if it could find my phone and I got an error message that said unexpected error when trying to call the phone. I was assuming it was going to send the same tone to my phone that it would send if I double pressed the tile button. It seemed to indicate it was trying to call my phone, but I am not sure how it could do that since I never gave it my phone number.I ended up deleting the app from my iPad in case having it on two devices was confusing it. There is a thing where you can send a link to your PC and that did not work either. I can not find a place to enter my phone number. I tried deleting and reinstalling the app and the find my phone thing just does not work except when I press the tile button twice on the actual tile.That brings me to another error. When I was sitting here I double pressed the tile button and it did not ring my phone. I checked the app and it was running in the background but it gave me another tone that seemed to indicate that it could not find my phone. After opening the app and then trying again it did work.I feel skeptical that this thing will really be a lifeline if I actually lose something. It seems to work half the time and the other half of the time it does not. It also in one place said I had two tiles in my account and I only set up one of the tiles so I am not sure what is up with that. I am planning to set up the other tile with my husbands phone and keys, so I never set it up yet. Maybe the tiles are paired already because they know they came from the same box.One other thing. Considering the price of these, and that they work via my bluetooth, I am not sure why every time I press a button in the app I keep getting urged to sign up for tile premium? I could see if the tiles were only like $5 each, but I think that these new ones are at least $50 for two of them. For that price I should not be prompted at every turn with an ad for Tile Premium.As for the range. It says up to 400 ft. So I put the keys in the middle of my house and walked out to the mailbox by the street, and it said that the tile was out of range. My lot is maybe 180ft deep and our backyard is way longer than our front so I am guessing that I was maybe 80-90 feet. Perhaps that is only if your keys are in an open area with no walls. Anyway I would not assume that 400 ft applies, unless maybe you are out in an open field.I'm really disappointed in these. I definitely do not think these are worth the price tag. To me for something designed to work to find something lost which is a stressful situation, these are just not consistently reliable. If I do lose my keys I will not know if it says they are out of range because they are out of range or if the thing is just malfunctioning.Thanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks

I was certainly not out of range, it was only inches away. I was freaking out thinking I threw my keys in the trash when I finally found them in a zippered compartment. They never rang!

Ok that is disturbing. After looking around the app for awhile it just randomly started working again. I do not have any issues with any other things that connect via bluetooth so I found this odd.I tried downloading the app on my iPad to see if it could find my phone and I got an error message that said unexpected error when trying to call the phone. I was assuming it was going to send the same tone to my phone that it would send if I double pressed the tile button. It seemed to indicate it was trying to call my phone, but I am not sure how it could do that since I never gave it my phone number.I ended up deleting the app from my iPad in case having it on two devices was confusing it. There is a thing where you can send a link to your PC and that did not work either. I can not find a place to enter my phone number. I tried deleting and reinstalling the app and the find my phone thing just does not work except when I press the tile button twice on the actual tile.That brings me to another error.

",0.91753822640,electronics,"I've had the Shield 2015 since release. It's a great device, very good performance and excellent audio and video options with a good app selection, but it has always had one serious flaw, the available remote options were just bad. The original gamepad controller was awkward, the updated gamepad and TV remotes have awful volume controls. Battery on all three was quite short and only worsened after a few years.The remote here is finally good. It feels nice in the hand and button action is pretty good. The layout isn't perfect but it's simple enough. I could skip the Netflix button as well but it isn't too obnoxious. Hopefully the battery lasts as long as it says (~6 months on two standard AAA batteries).Sadly one limitation of the 2015 and 2017 shield models was not fixed here. You still cannot play YouTube HDR content due to no hardware acceleration for the VP9 profile 2 codec. This is the biggest disappointment in the new model for me. If YouTube HDR is really important, you may want to just get the Chromecast Ultra but for all other uses the Shield is a nicer device.Otherwise it's the same Shield TV for the most part. Nvidia has done a really good job supporting the existing model and there's little reason to upgrade if you have one. Definitely pick up the new remote though, it's backwards compatible and will be available separately.One more thing to note is that there does not seem to be a way to use software volume control on this model. You do have IR volume if your receiver or TV is in the supported list, but if you have a rare audio receiver or TV, and CEC volume doesn't work for you, the volume buttons won't do anything. There's quite a few IR setups available under settings but no way to manually configure IR codes if you have a device that isn't listed.

I highly recommend them to any AV enthusiast who wants or needs the best streaming box. It's able to pass proper uncompressed audio and video to high-end receivers that no other streamer device can do. At least not correctly.After the minor downgrade with the 2017 model, I was looking forward to an ""upgrade"" with the 2019 version. However, after a weekend of playing with this device, it's getting returned. Here's why:DESIGN & REMOTEFirst, this is the Pro version, which is physically the same as the 2017 model. It's still lacking an IR receiver, despite an upgraded remote. Which I will start by saying is probably the best feature of the new model. It uses Bluetooth to communicate with the Shield and will send IR signals to compatible devices. It works with my Onkyo receiver so I can power on/off with a single button and adjust the volume. However, it is not compatible with my Optoma projector.The remote is nicely backlit and has much more useful buttons than in the past. The ""V"" shape is quite awkward as it doesn't lay flat on a surface. What's wrong with a normal remote form factor?IR RECEIVER (3rd party)Since Nvidia refuses to include a basic IR receiver, I did purchase a generic USB IR receiver which other users reported worked fine with the previous generation Shield TV's. However, there seems to be some changes with the 2019 version. The ""back"" button command won't exit out of some apps. You have to use the remote to do that or hit the home button.And it doesn't accept dedicated power off/on commands. You'll have to change your Harmony remote to use the power toggle command instead. It works, but it's less ideal.NVidia seriously needs to consider bringing back the built-in IR receiver. At least for the ""high-end"" PRO model. Especially when the included remote only works with a handful of TV's.VIDEOThis is an area where the Nvidia Shield TV generally excels. But right out of the gate, it failed with color profiles. You'll have to Google that for more information, also look for colorimetry. As with the previous generation devices, there is an option to enable color matching. Basically, this ensures the Shield is sending the correct color profile used by the content your viewing. Without this, you'll have dull or very inaccurate color representation for the content your watching.However, this appears to ""broken"" with the 2019 Shield TV. They've broken this before with past Shield OS upgrades and have eventually fixed it. But I'm not sure why these features continue to be repeatedly messed up considering how important it is for the enthusiast customer they are targetting.It appears to try to apply the color profile when it changes, but it's not sending the proper signal to the source for switching between BT.2020 and 709. Which confuses the heck out of my projector as it's not sure what's going on.My projector doesn't support Dolby Vision, so I'm not able to test that feature. But it is a nice addition for those who can use it.AUDIOSo far I haven't seen any issues with audio passthrough. It's another one of the key highlights of the Nvidia Shield TV devices in that they can pass through just about any high-quality audio format to your receiver for processing. Most other streaming boxes will compress or transcode the signal into a lesser quality. Instead of crisp and distinct sounds, you would get muffled audio.Once again, this is going to be something you'll absolutely appreciate with a good high-end audio system. Although with that said, I'm not seeing the 2019 model bring anything new to the table. At least not that the previous shields TV's could do. Any format I can throw at it works great with all Shield TV's, including Atmos.PERFORMANCEI didn't notice any change in performance as I switched back and forth between my 2015 and 2019 Shield TV. It's still one of the fastest streaming boxes you can buy. But I was hoping for a boost in performance to smooth out transitions, animations, and perhaps make it a bit more snappy. It's not even close to being slow and works just fine for me. But since this was advertised as being ""25%"" faster"" I was quite disappointed.Then as I'm wrapping up this review, it has also been confirmed by other reviewers that the 2019 model is indeed no faster than previous models. As verified with 3rd party benchmarking apps.AI UPSCALINGThis was an interesting feature I was looking forward to testing. Even though the majority of my content is now at least 1080p or 4k, I do still have older videos that could benefit from further clarity. It's also worth noting that the AI upscaling disables itself with higher quality content. But there is a nice comparison feature so you can see the upscaling work in real-time.Basically, it works, it enhances the image, but you may or may not like it. I found in some cases it looked better. And in other cases, the improved sharpening and enhancement gave the image an artificial look. Perhaps further software updates can improve this.CONCLUSIONAs I stated at the beginning, the Nvidia Shield TV is still the absolutely best streaming device you can buy. But the 2019 model takes a few steps back. As compared to the past models, it's too expensive for how little you get in the ""upgrade"" department. If they can fix the software issues (which I'm sure they will) and drop the price by at least 25% for both models, I'd give the Shield TV 2019 a solid recommend and 4+ star rating.With the caveat that expected discounts on older models are probably still going to be a better buy. At present time, you're certainly better off with the 2017 model. Unless you can find the original 2015 model, which I still believe is the best version.
",0.22744014940,electronics,"Both the regular and Pro of the Nvidia Shield TV are great entries within the Shield product line.  It would have a been a been a slam dunk if the Pro offered upgradeable internal storage, like the original Pro, but the USB 3.0 ports should be sufficient enough for probably most users and applications.Ultimately, my only complaint with the Pro is that it really is just a hardware refresh of the original 2017 version of the unit, including the fact it doesn't come with the pictured stand, the assumption being that you can purchase and use the non-Pro stand for an additional $20.  And where it appears that the new non-pro uses the new USB-C standard--which is used everywhere, from smart phones to laptops, the Pro still uses the old proprietary standard, nor does it come with a convenient microSD slot present on the non-Pro unit.So with this being said, it begs the question:  Why even call this the Pro when it's simply a hardware revision of the old non-Pro?  In my opinion, they should have kept the original name and simply called the other unit the 'Mini' or some other moniker.  In fact, besides the novel hardware revision, most people would probably be satisfied with the cheaper, nearly identical 2017 version of the unit--which often comes with a bundled controller, if it wasn't for the fact Nvidia inexplicably halted Android updates for what is otherwise a more than capable device.  The gist of what I'm getting at is that it's difficult to constitute paying an additional $50 for a couple of USB 3.0 ports ( of which portable, external hard drives will probably never saturate), when you can get the non-Pro (2019) version which supposedly has nearly identical hardware.
",0.79585826440,electronics,"In the box, I got the Shield TV, remote, and power adapter. They really could have at least included an HDMI cable so you could connect it out of the box but didn't. I also think it is pretty lame to show the unit on the box cover and all advertising with a vertical stand. You don't get it, the side of the box clearly shows you don't get it, but still, they show it front and center as if it is part of it. I'm fine without it, it just bugs me that they show it all over.I have the original 2015 16GB Shield TV and picked up this one so I could move the old one to another TV. The Shield TV has probably been one of my best electronics purchases in a long time. It gets regular updates and generally works really well, I expect this to continue with this version. Not many devices are supported for this length of time.As for the differences, I'd say this one is about 40% smaller than the original but otherwise looks the same. The new one is missing the MicroSD slot, IR receiver, and micro USB port but I never used any of them.The remote has also been updated and I like it. My original remote is one of the rechargeable thin ones with the headphone jack for remote listening. I never used the headphone jack so I won't miss that. The new remote is triangle-shaped but fits well in your hand. I am sure this will make it much harder to lose in your recliner. I lost my original remote down in my chair many times and always had to flip the chair and fish the remote out so I didn't crush it in the chair mechanism. The new remote has backlit buttons that light up when you move the remote which is really nice. You also get more buttons, whos position maybe isn't ideal but in use, I haven't had a problem with them. The remote is powered by 2AAA batteries that were already inserted from the factory. Time will tell how long they last. There is also an IR Blaster and beeper for lost remote location integrated into the remote. The new box adds a faster processor, better 4K upscaling, and Dolby Vision support.Usage wise everything is pretty much the same. The improved upscaling does make a lot of content look sharper. I'm not really noticing much of a performance difference if any during general use, the original box worked really well too.You really aren't missing out on much if you already have an older box and I'd only say to get one if you require Dolby Vision support. I've read you should be able to buy the new remote separately for use on the older box so if that is what has your interest you should be covered there. I don't know if they will make the units diverge more down the road via updates but for now, they are really close. Overall I'd consider this a minor update to an already good box, good for newcomers or others who want another unit for another TV or Dolby Vision support.
",0.78594273340,electronics,"I bought this to upgrade from Fire TV 1st Gen (2014), expecting a better experience, and I was very disappointed. Despite being the ""top tier"" box, this seems like a half-baked product.Googling Shield TV forums or subreddits yields a litany of problems with this item. The most common one for me is where the audio / video is out of sync when watching streaming movies, making it useless for that purpose. I've also experienced picture glitching in the video stream, even though it's plugged into ethernet with a 200/200 mbps connection.Another major problem I had was with picture quality, the image was blown out with the default settings. It took me a day to find the proper settings to make it look normal, but it was a very frustrating process for a simple HDMI connection to a regular HDTV. I never had such problems with other set top boxes. The experience of having to tweak settings over and over again made me want to throw it in the trash.This product comes across more as an android computer you can plug into your TV rather than a video delivery product that's ready for prime time. Haven't run into a problem with video game console emulation, so that's something good I can say about it.I intended to use this to consolidate my media consumption to one device, but it's shown that I need to hold onto my older hardware if I want to be sure I can actually watch the content without issues. If I could go back I wouldn't have bought this.
",0.12131974140,electronics,"Been using and testing dozens of Android TV boxes for the past 4 years. Until now, I never found one that didn't allow full use with a USB transmitter and mouse or a Bluetooth mouse. Was able to get ONLY the left mouse button to respond, never the right button to go back to a prior screen or action. Mice also failed when a popup keyboard appeared (did not allow any key selections). Bye Bye NVIDIA Shield TV Pro because most of the apps I use work much faster and easier when I have the use of a normal mouse.Yes, there is a workaround mouse apk you can install so you use the NVIDIA remote control as a quasi mouse but that is annoyingly slower for anyone who is accustomed to the kind of mouse most of us have been using for many years.
",0.15971407340,electronics,"This is my second shield. I still own the 2017 model, which looks the same. I upgrade because this is my most important device in my home theater setup (besides the speakers and amp). I use it for all streaming apps like Netflix, Prime, Plutotv and most importantly Kodi. I connect Kodi to my Open Media Vault server to host my movie collection. So far with the AI upscaling I set it low. Seems to help with detail.  I found on default that it was jittery when I stream from Plutotv. I'll continue to test that feature out. Love the remote even though I use a harmony elite. The remote has a nice feel and I use it after I turn on the system for general navigation.  Works well still, with my RII mini keyboard. I've yet to test the Dolby vision,  but I have no doubt it will work well. If you are like me and use the device the most, then upgrade. Next version I hope is over the top in power, but I'm happy Nvidia is still active with this product.
",0.91116249640,electronics,"I purchased this to upgrade from a 4K fire stick as it wasn't handling my streaming needs very well across the multiple platforms I subscribe to. I also wanted to do some lite gaming. I'm very impressed with how easy it was to set up with my TV using the built-in IR. Sideloading all my apps was simple to do as long as you know what you're doing and what to look for. The speed of the unit is amazing compared to my fire stick. Setting the unit up was sort of odd. I had to sign up for an Nvidia account which is normal, and then I had to sign into my Google account. If you want to play games, you need to sign up for the GeForce Now beta and wait. Or if you don't want to wait, you can buy a code off of eBay and play right away. To play games requires a steam account and a credit card depending on the game you want to play. I was able to play Left for Dead 2 with my Xbox One controller without any problems. If you do encounter any problems, make sure you install the latest software update. It should prompt you after you log in and connect the shield to Wi-Fi. Overall it's a fantastic unit. As others have pointed out, it's not worth upgrading from your old shield. Since I'm coming from a fire stick, it's a big upgrade for me.
",0.1274454340,electronics,"I have used many streamers over the years, including Apple TV, Roku and Nvidia Shield (2017 version). The new Nvidia Shield is just fantastic, especially compared to the older 2017 version.The 2017 version was just mediocre and I never used it much, preferring my Apple TV to it. It had a number of flaws, mostly to do with the remote. The remote would lose connection all the time. It would also discharge quickly as it lay on the coffee table. When I really needed it for streaming, it would need a recharge, which was so frustrating. The older version version also was not as fluid in the its operation.This version fixes it all!REMOTE* The remote is a joy to use. It never loses connection. It just works!* The triangular cross section of the remote is a joy to hold. It doesn't slip out of your hand like some other slippery remotes (*cough& Apple TV). It has hard buttons for forward/back so that you don't have to use a touch pad that constantly registers unintended touches that result in an unintended action (*cough* Apple TV).* A nice touch with the remote is that the buttons light up for a few seconds as you pick it up, making it easy to see in the dark.PICTURE QUALITYAfter more than a week of use, comparing it to my Apple TV, 4K picture quality is crisper and more detailed. I am using Netflix, Amazon Prime and Youtube TV to compare.SOUND QUALITYConnected to my Marantz receiver, sound quality is excellent. Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision support is a plus. I like the fact that it faithfully transmits the signal to my receiver to decode, unlike the Apple TV that does the decoding itself and transmits multi channel PCM to the receiver. Apple TV's decoding sometimes messes things up. Watching Dunkirk on the ATV, it just sucks the life out the audio. I am glad I am getting the original Dolby signal with the Shield for my receiver to decode.SOFTWARE QUALITYSoftware is just Android 9 for TV. Either you like Android TV or not. I think it has come a long way and I like it.The new Tegra processor does an awesome job. Using the device is fast, smooth and fluid. No lags or glitches.Overall I am really happy with this product. It has now become my goto streamer, replacing the Apple TV.Some users have complained that it does not have a browser or you cannot download stuff and so on. If you are the geeky type and need those things, it might not be for you. But if you want a fantastic media streamer for the home where you can use Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play, Youtube TV etc for video and Spotify, Google Play Music, Tidal etc for your music, and where things just work, this one is for you.
",0.83035099540,electronics,"AI upscaling displays 1080P bluray MKVs very nicely. Noticeably sharper image. Right out of the box you can start streaming. App based OS is very familiar to anyone with a phone.  I have this set up as a Kodi/Sling  playback device. The documentation is sparse, and it was a brief challenge to connect to networked windows shares , but after figuring out how to map my server, all the shares are readily available. Although I use a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to set everything up (typing on a remote is no good), the remote has shown itself to have some nice features, again, not documented anywhere. For Kodi, the right mouse button is an important tool; Holding the select button, acts as a right mouse click bringing up the important menus. I look forward to finding more tricks, but It would be nice for Nvidia to document the many features of this device. Streaming, Gaming, Movies, TV, all have different approaches to set up and usage. Nvidia kind of leaves you researching on your own to get the most out of a very capable device.

However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.

",0.05782234742,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.08309632542,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

",0.2009450242,electronics,"I l logged in to increase my rating but my review was not there.  In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.  Hint to Tech Support:  Recommend this to callers if your hour+ of support does not produce results.

",0.84786665443,electronics,"There will be plenty of reviews for the Studio in stand alone, single speaker use. It does sound excellent that way. But if you pair two Studios and throw in the Echo Sub, that is an extraordinary composition! That is the way to do the Echo Studio! That is how I'll review it here.I decided I must pair two Studios since I had two Echo Plus's stereo paired with an Echo Sub and it sounded pretty darn good. So I had to try the Studio paired in stereo, and since I had the Sub, I threw that in too. What else am I going to do with it? The Sub added a lot to the two Plus's. I wondered would you even notice it with the two Studios? I'm here to say that you definitely notice it. You notice it's not there, I can tell you.The sound of this whole system (two Echo Studios and the Echo Sub) is quite exceptional. I would have to say it's thrilling! Yes, it costs $530 but that is bound to come down and did I tell you that it sounds incredible? It commands a respect, it really does. There is such a depth to this. The bass is deliberate and authoritative. Very punchy. It has exceptional dynamic range (at high volumes this can be startling) and the stereo image is just stunning. An enormous stage. Those 6 midrange speakers sound sweet indeed. Be sure to turn everything up in the equalizer in Audio Settings of the device in the Alexa App. This thing likes loud! It can easily handle max volume for extensive listening.You crank this up to ten and it literally takes over the room. If you can listen at that volume for awhile with this system (you must live without neighbors) you will be found with a huge smile on your face.All of Amazon's music library is now available in lossless CD quality streaming or better, which shines on this. The new celebrated 3D formats also sound excellent, though I thought there'd be more to them (Abbey Road sounded great but I didn't think it was transformed). But anything you play on this will sound exceptional. I really can't believe Amazon has taken it this far from the original Echo. Bravo! I notice that the Apple Homepod is now down to $200 at Best Buy. Would two of them paired sound better than this setup? I truly doubt it. They'd need a subwoofer and none, as far as I know, are available for it.A few things. The circling Alexa lights are now on top of the speaker. You can no longer really see them from the side, which is unfortunate. I love those lights! And two, the Studio comes with this ""spatial"" setting set. I recommend turning it off. In the Alexa app, go to the device and then Audio Settings and below the equalizer is that on off button for the spatial effect. I don't find it adds anything even though it really changes the acoustics. But if you want to hear music as it was recorded, leave this off.Oh, and I have to say that Amazon still does not make it super easy to set this all up. You have to start with a new or deregistered speaker. Set up each separately and then pair them. But it's anything but obvious or close to foolproof. Come on, Amazon!And I feel I must tell you that you can't connect to the Studio by Bluetooth when stereo paired. It will only play through one Studio, the first one you set up. To use the Studios in stereo pair with the Echo Sub, you can only stream. And you can only stream if you pay.Finally, then, these things are big. Really quite large. And seemingly only available now in black, though there's a gray one in Amazon's web site ads. This is not a speaker that sits demurely upon a table. It's almost as big as the Echo Sub, if that helps visualize it. But you will definitely be challenged as to its home, because that is where this will stay, like forever. Especially if you go for the whole magilla. But I urge you to at least try it (the whole magilla!). But be prepared, I guarantee you won't send them back!
",0.96374976643,electronics,"After installing the update (that took an hour) it still won't consistently play music. I don't know if this device is ready for primetime as this seems like a common issue.I was very excited for this one as I use my original echo daily to listen to the radio or music. Little difference between this device and the original when it comes to listening to talk radio like NPR or news streaming. The music that it did play sounded better than the original echo (much of the difference was an increase of bass). It sounded good when it played music.I have returned it because of the inconsistency and lack of functionality. I opted to not get a replacement though because I have my echo spot hooked up to a Boston Acoustics speaker that sounds as good and it's cheaper than the $200 For this speaker.Having used this ""studio"" version, I would recommend hooking up your old Alexa to a quality speaker instead of spending the money on this one. I find this to be a much more versatile option. Plus this thing is huge and didn't fit in the place where my original echo sits.My experience with Amazon customer service this time was horrible! I talked with about 15 different representatives to arrange for a ups pickup for the defective one and now I need to contact ups and try to accomplish this. Seems like Amazons policies or customer service has taken a nosedive.
",0.82445073143,electronics,"I had a Sonos beam and sub combo that cost $1,200 and it sounded great but I was never happy with it not being able to be a part of the multi room audio with all of my other echo speakers.  I was hoping the Studio might be close enough in sound quality that I could replace Sonos.  I purchased two Studios and a sub it has definitely surpassed my expectations.  Goodbye Sonos!  I feel like our living room is the closest we can get to a movie theater experience without spending thousands of dollars and you can get it all for a little over $500.  Sonos is definitely clear and loud but I feel the Atmos and 3D Music add a depth to the sound that the Sonos is missing.  It's like a whole new experience watching Jack Ryan with these running Atmos...so good!I didn't have any issues adding the Studios/Sub to a Home Theater group to my Fire TV.  All you have to do is make sure the Fire TV and Studios all have the latest firmware.  You can check in the Fire TV menu and you can ask the Studios to update the software.  I even like how when you increase volume the Fire TV cube and both Studios Alexa indicators light up so you can tell how much you are increasing/decreasing volume.Amazon has always provided a great value for their good products at a good price but I feel they have exceeded expectations with the Studio.  This is definitely an awesome product for an awesome price!
",0.78450506943,electronics,"Disclaimer: this is not my first Echo device - I have altogether 5 of them at the moment, and have used them for at least 3 years.Unlike other reviewer who criticized this gadget, I had no problems with setting it up and with using it. It works fine, plays music and answers questions. I am just unhappy with the sound, that was, of course, the primary reason to upgrade from Echo Plus to this device.The good:a. Bass is better that on my Echo Plus.The bad:a. Trebles are  very bad and muddy. Rudimentary equalizer settings (Bass, Midrange, Treble) are not sufficient to adjust the sound properly. I believe the problem is mostly due to phase cancellation effect on a single tweeter that mixes signal from left and right channels. Amazon developers, please consider either adding another tweeter in the next generation, or employing a better algorithm that will minimize phase cancellation effect.b. The switch for ""Stereo Spatial Enhancement"", that is enabled by default, makes the sound much worse and completely kills the trebles.c. There is a clear dis-balance in volume between spoken voice (that appears too quiet) and music (too loud). So every time you use it, you need to adjust the volume.d. Light ring that shows that Alexa is listening for you can be seen only from above, and not from the side, so if you ask Alexa to do something from 3 steps away, you don't know if it can hear you or not.
",0.09313827843,electronics,"I am very pleasantly surprised.  I have an Echo Plus which I thought sounded good (but it's mono).  I'm a big-time audiophile.  My home theater subwoofer is a Velodyne SPL-1200 II (1000 Watt with a 12"" Kevlar cone), my main speakers are hand made with RAAL electrostatic ribbon tweeters and solid bamboo cabinets - five identical.  Point being, I enjoy good sound and I have a very picky ear.  I like full range clarity and balance.  More than anything, I'm tired of wires at my home computer workstation, I've tried so hard to simplify things.  My Bose Companion 20's are incredible but they're cumbersome, top-heavy and require way too much wiring.Problem is, no single speaker I've tried has had the sound-stage two or more speakers can have.  So I decided to try this...  Awesome Amazon.  Incredible.  The Dolby Atmos actually sounds like I am sitting in front of two speakers (or more).  I had to move it around a little bit to find a sweet spot but it is so nice.  Frank Sinatra sounds like he's in the room.  The bass is full without distortion unless you crank the volume all the way, the clarity is there.  The unit is heavy and substantial.  I'll be enjoying this for both my computer content and yours as I have the Dot, Alexa, and Echo Plus.
",0.89633083343,electronics,"UPDATE 11/21/19 - I received a replacement unit on 11/13.  I set it up and everything seems to be working.  I would note that for whatever reason the packaging of the replacement was more generic than what I originally got (the box didn't have the picture of the device on it, just was plain black) and it didn't come with the power cord which I had sent back with the defective unit.  I don't care about the box at all but why not supply the power cord??? (luckily for me I had a spare I could use from another device - it's just a generic figure 8 power cord).  I did also pair the new device with an echo sub I used to have connected to a stereo pair of Gen 2 Echos.  I like the sound from the studio and I definitely can hear the difference in 3D music vs. non-3D music.  Interestingly now that it is paired with the sub I don't really notice the Studio being that much better than the stereo pair of Gen 2 echos (with sub) that I used before when playing non-3D music.  Granted I'm no audiophile but I'm wondering if it was worth the upgrade when I already had the sub to help the Gen 2 Echos in the bass dept.  I debated changing the rating since the replacement works as advertised and I think Amazon customer service was great (although after leaving the negative review below they called me within an hour or two - otherwise I had been waiting for a few days for follow-up), however the whole review/experience may get missed by others if I up the score so I'll leave as-is.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW 11/11/19:I preordered this speaker the day after it was announced.  With 8 existing Echos around the house I was more than excited to experience the sound quality from this HomePod killer.  It arrived on launch day (11/7) and I immediately went to work setting it up.  With baited breath I told Alexa to ""play the best of 3D music"" in order to get the full 3D experience and Alexa repeated my command as a confirmation.  Then......  nothing.  No music.  No sound.  Was the volume too low?  No, it was set around 5/10.  About 30-45 seconds after the initial command Alexa told me ""Sorry, I'm having trouble playing the music"".Long story short I tried everything - playing different stations, playlists, individual songs, etc.  All with the same result.  Alexa would repeat my command as confirmation (just like the other Echos prior to playing what I asked) but then there was silence for anywhere from 15-45 seconds before she would tell me ""I'm having trouble playing the music"".  I called tech support after running through all the online suggestions (reboot cable modem, reboot router, reset Echo, remove and reinstall Alexa app, etc.).  Even though the Studio was in the same spot in my house where an existing Echo pair with Sub was located I put the Echo Studio 6 inches from the router and went through some more troubleshooting with the tech on the phone.  I asked the Studio to update software and was told on several attempts ""Sorry, I experienced a problem, please try again later"".To be clear the Echo does everything else it is supposed to - control lights, answer questions, play the news, etc.  It just won't play music (and I'm an unlimited subscriber).After an hour on the phone with the Amazon tech he was clueless.  He pulled some logs to send to engineering team and I've yet to hear back.  I REALLY wanted to love this new Echo and the sound quality but right now it's not even up to par with an Echo Dot - at least the Dot can play music.I'm sure this will get sorted out somehow, either with some update or with the replacement of the device itself.  It's just frustrating to wait so long for the preorder, get the device, and have it not work.  And Amazon's Echo Studio page is saying it's out of stock until 12/10 so it may be another month before I can have the chance to hear music on a replacement.  I hope others that got theirs on launch day didn't have the same experience!
",0.543,electronics,"I got this unit to replace my old Bose SLII and it was an excellent decision; your get a decent bass and clear sound. I really liked some of the 3D sound songs available in Amazon HD, however not all of them are impressive. I also tried the extended stereo feature and it does a decent job in electronic music but it sound unnatural in acoustic/vocal songs.I did not notice any difference between Spotify and Amazon music, I'm not 100% that the streaming was even HD because when I clicked in the icon Amazon Music app said that the information was not available. I don't rate down the speaker for this because is an Amazon HD problem, but just to make my point clear: this is not an audiophile grade speaker, it sounds very good but it doesn't reach the clarity I got from my M-Audio monitors.In my humble opinion this speaker is a better option than Apple Homepod.
",0.95289564143,electronics,"Great upgrade for my open floorplan.  I started with a dot and worked my way up until I had the previous top model (3"" woofer and .8"" tweeter) paired with the matching sub.  While that pair was great across the spectrum, the soundstage was off due to the sub sitting against the wall, rather than next to the echo.  I had reservations that the front firing tweeter on the Studio wouldn't disperse well from the center of the house, however that isn't an issue.  The studio sits on my kitchen bar and points away from the kitchen.  It does great at filling the central part of the house with music, including the kitchen ""behind"" it. Had I not done my research,  I probably wouldn't have realized it had a front firing tweeter, vice up or down.I moved the sub into the master bedroom where it's near that echo.  This added the low end to the bedroom without the spatial blur of the sub sitting away from the mids/highs.Back to the Studio... it delivers premium sound to the bulk of my first floor and now that the woofer is integrated into the echo, the soundstage is no longer off/annoying.There has been a steady improvement in audio quality over the past several models and generations, now that the Studio delivers premium sound in a single package... I'm not sure where Amazon will go next.  I'd buy a smaller future device IF it delivered equal sound quality.  I am not interested in sacrificing range or depth for size though.  The Studio fits fine on the bar and I can crank it up when the wife is out.Considering the Studio is full range in a single device, I am very pleased with the pricing.  If Amazon offers any holiday deals, you should definitely give in and upgrade to at least one studio.  If no deals soon, give in and pay full price like I did.  I think it's still a bargain at full price.For comparison, downstairs I have the studio, a premium echo with sub paired, another premium, 1 echo in the garage, and dots in the kids' rooms.  I guess towers will eventually work their way into the kids' rooms... upstairs I run Monitor Audio Silver 7.2 with SVS cylinder subs and I still have a dot hooked up to my receiver to listen to audio commands.Well done Amazon. Oh, one final nod to incorporating a spectral automatic equalizer to immediately adjust the Studio's audio output to match it specifically to your room's configuration.
",0.74333554543,electronics,"The Amazon Echo Studio is a one of a kind audio device with a unique sound you've likely never heard before from a standalone speaker.Some thought and engineering was put into this product and it clearly shows with it's sound quality.When I first played a song from the Studio I felt like I had speaker in every direction in my house; almost like being at a concert. To me it sounds better than a stereo pair. I can only imagine the sound quality when paired with a second Studio since one alone has already knocked my socks off.The Echo Studio is by far the largest speaker Amazon has released but in the grand scheme it's quite small when compared with a 5.1 stereosystem which that's basically what you're getting here from one Echo Studio speaker with it's 5 mulidirectional internal speakers system.I've read a few critiques about the aesthetics of the Studio with it's gray woven cloth but to me it looks just fine with it's minimalist design. But I didn't buy the Studio to look at, I bought it so I could hear the wonderful sound it emits.Regarding the bass you can feel it in your chest and feet when played at higher volumes. it's somewhat of a perplexing experience because of the Studio's size. What wizardry is in this Echo? I don't know but I don't really care. It does what it does and does it well.To sum things up, this is one superb audio device that truly delivers with immersive sound. If you buy the Echo Studio you will likely be highly impressed for what you're getting at the price point. The Amazon Echo Studio has likely paved the way for the next evolution of sound, who knows what the future holds.
",0.543,electronics,"I don't have a clue why anyone would say it doesn't play music nor work. This thing plugged into my wireless network as easily as all the other Alexa devices.Music playback is better - much better - than the other Echo devices (because of the speakers).

",0.85357987944,electronics,"Original review: April 15, 2019, and two updates at the end of this review (April 16, 2019, and April 18, 2019)ORIGINAL REVIEW: April 15, 2019 (4/5 stars)UPDATED REVIEW: April 18, 2019 (5/5 stars)For background information, I am a professor and a tech geek. I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (1 Kindle Touch, 1 Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and 1 Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).Below is my summary of the “all-new Kindle” (Kindle 10th generation). I have spent the past few days playing around with the Kindle, reading from it, and reading other online reviews about this version to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. For reference purposes, this Kindle model was last refreshed in 2016. This model is the lowest-end basic flagship model of the Kindle e-reader.THE BOX: The Kindle device, a quick-start guide, and a USB cord. The item arrived sealed well. Please note that Amazon does not provide a wall adapter. Also, the Kindle box is smaller than the Paperwhite box.Availability: Black and White are the base colors variants. Additionally, Kindle fabric covers can be purchased for $29.99 in 4 different colors: Charcoal Black, Cobalt Blue, Punch Red, and Sandstone White from Amazon. I wouldn’t recommend these overpriced covers. There are several other quality and aesthetically pleasing covers that can be found on Amazon that are affordable, well rated, and function better.Summary of key aspects that have changed:- Price increase of $10 from the prior version- An adjustable backlight composed of 4 LEDs that helps readers with reading both indoors and outdoors. I love this feature. This feature alone justifies the additional $10 price increase in my opinion.- Updated design- Latest e-ink technology for better contrast that helps makes the text crisper. The text is crisper than prior version (see images) but not as crisp as higher end models.Things that have not changed from prior Kindle model:- Battery life remains the same- Charge time remains the same- Glare-free display- Option to hear Audible books through Bluetooth headphones or speakers.- Screen size remains the same at 6 inch- Storage remains the same at 4GB- Warranty remains the same: 1-year limited warranty and service along with product purchase. An additional warranty should be separately purchased if deemed necessary.Technical specs:- 167 pixel per inch (PPI) capacitive touch display (please note that though the PPI value remains the same as the prior model, there is sharper contrast because of the new e-ink technology used in the newer model)- 6-inch screen- Bluetooth- LED(s): 4 LED- Storage: 4 GB- Size: 6.3” x 4.5” x 0.34” (160 x 113 x 8.7 mm). As compared to the prior model, there is a 2mm reduction in width and 4 mm reduction in depth/height).- Weight: 6.1 oz (As compared to prior Kindle 8, there is a 0.4 oz increase in weight).Comparison between Kindle 10 (this version – 2019 release) referred to as Kindle below and Kindle Paperwhite (10th generation-2018 release – mid-tier model):- Charge: Kindle holds 4 weeks of charge while Kindle Paperwhite holds 6 weeks of charge- Connectivity: Kindle only has Wi-Fi option while Kindle Paperwhite offers Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + Cellular Connectivity- Cost: Kindle costs $89.99 while Kindle Paperwhite costs $129.99 though previous sales were present that offered the item for $89.99 which can be stacked (please read below section on saving money for Kindle purchases)- LEDs: Kindle has 4 LEDs while Kindle Paperwhite has 5 LEDs- PPI: Kindle has 167 PPI while Kindle Paperwhite has 300 PPI- Water resistance: Kindle has no IPX8-rating (basically not water-resistant) while Kindle Paperwhite has the IPX8-rating (i.e., it allows submersion in 2 meters of fresh water for up to one hour).- Storage: Kindle offers 4GB storage while Kindle Paperwhite offers additional storage (8 GB or 32 GB)- Design: Kindle doesn’t have the flush front design while Kindle Paperwhite does Display size: remains the same (6 inches).-Total size: Even though the display size (previously mentioned) remains the same the specs of the items are different. Kindle: 10 6.3” x 4.5” x 0.34” (160 x 113 x 8.7 mm) while Kindle Paperwhite: 6.6” x 4.6” x 0.3” (167 x 116 x 8.18 mm).- Weight: Kindle 10 weighs 6.1 oz while Kindle Paperwhite Wi-Fi: 6.4 oz (182 g) Wi-Fi + Free Cellular Connectivity: 6.8 oz (191 g).I have refrained from comparing the Kindle Oasis in this review with the Kindle 10 because it is the highest-end model and if a consumer is looking at this model, then it is highly unlikely they are considering the Kindle Oasis. Besides, the Kindle Oasis costs around 3 times the amount of the Kindle 10 and 2 times the cost of the Kindle Paperwhite. Consequently, it would not be a fair and/or necessary comparison for this review.Some useful features on Kindle readers (not a comprehensive list):- Accessibility features: VoiceView screen reader (works through Bluetooth audio) and provides directions to help visually impaired readers to navigate through the device and read books with text-to-speech (this feature is only available in the English language). Additionally, to help visually impaired readers, Kindle also includes the ability to adjust the font size, font face, line spacing, and margins.- Smart Lookup (quickly check the default dictionary). The default, New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford Dictionary of English (both from Oxford University Press).- Supports the following content formats: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively; HTML DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, PMP through conversion; Audible audio format (AAX).- Users can review Wikipedia to understand word meanings better.- Integration with Goodreads (Amazon-owned book database).- Option to highlight words on the screen- Pdf and word documents can be sent to Kindle through email after a Kindle-specific email address is created.- Provides the option to share word or texts and additional commentary by the user.- Add a note regarding the word.- Translate a word from English to 16 languages.- Whispersync (sync progress across Kindle devices and apps)- X-Ray tool, which provides detailed information on key content in the book (i.e. “bones of the book”).Testing:Speed: Comparable to prior modelsWi-Fi: I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network and use the experiential browser without any technical difficulties. The process was pretty straightforward.Saving money on purchasing the Kindle:- The initial purchase with a promo discount entitles you to a free 3-month Kindle Unlimited subscription ($29.97 value). After 3-months subscription will auto-renew at $9.99 (this promo discount can be taken out at any point in time). This makes this purchase a worthwhile purchase with additional savings.- The cost for the Kindle will be $109.99 (without special offers). Customers can also disable special offers later by paying $20 if they purchase the Kindle with special offers ($89). Personally, I would recommend going the route of getting the special offers and then disabling it. The special offers only appear when the Kindle is locked/asleep and are non-intrusive. I have 6 kindles all of which have special offers and have never had an issue. However, if the user does not like the special offers, you can purchase the $89 kindle and then remove the special offers (which might probably end up saving you a few dollars because there are no taxes for disabling offers).- Customers should also know that they can easily trade-in their prior Kindle for Amazon gift cards ($5-$25) and also receive a 25% discount towards their new Kindle.- My recommendation would be to purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is coming up in July). The customer can get around $30 off, and then stack the trade-in and the 25% discount to get this item for a minimal cost (maybe you can snag it for $30-$40 if everything is applied correctly). However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point.Conclusion:To sum up, my review, this is the base version of the Kindle. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. I absolutely love the Kindle LEDs in this model. It makes a world of difference for night reading specifically when my family is in bed, and I don’t have to get up to turn on/off the house lamp and make a ton of noise. The bottom line is that the Kindle e-readers are incontestably the best e-readers currently in the market. This Kindle follows in the same trajectory as prior versions.April 16, 2019:  UPDATE # 1I would personally recommend the Kindle Paperwhite (mid-tier model) as opposed to this Kindle 10 (the model reviewed) for a few more dollars. This can be purchased after following the cost-saving suggestions previously listed. My reasons are several other features like higher resolution (300 PPI vs. 167 PPI), more LEDs (5 vs. 4), water resistance (IPX-8 rating), larger storage (8 or 32 GB), and a cellular option for higher-end models will give the edge for customers looking for more options. However, the Kindle 10 does well for a base entry model.April 18, 2019:  UPDATE # 2After additional testing, I have given the Kindle 10, 5/5 stars in my review (instead of the initial 4/5 stars). I did consider docking down ½ a star for no increase of PPI for this version (167 PPI). However, please note that the e-ink quality has significantly improved and the LEDs make a world of difference, so this is Kindle is much better (factoring in reader comfort and quality) than the prior Kindle model even though both have the same PPI. Besides, this is the base version. What more can one expect for $89? Additionally, please note that the PPI is not a big issue for those that don’t regularly use the device for reviewing images, graphs, pictures, manga, illustrations, etc. Please review my picture (uploaded) comparison between text of the Kindle Paperwhite 3rd gen and Kindle 10 for comparison purposes. It is hard to see any distinction on a cursory observation.Please also note that several resources were used in the compilation of this review, but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product.Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough and accurate job with the review. My reviews are my honest and comprehensive assessment of the product. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify both that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims in the review.
",0.544,electronics,"The pros: I like that you have a choice of colors and that it comes with a front light. It's small and easy to carry around. If you've never had a Kindle before or never had one higher than the base, you won't notice the 167 ppi difference between it and the Paperwhite and the Oasis.The cons: If, however, you're like me and you have an Oasis, you'll immediately notice how much less crisp the letters and pictures are.Don't get me wrong. It's a good price for a starter Kindle, especially with lights now. For someone who's looking for the best reading experience they can get without spending too much money, it's a good choice.However, for a few dollars more, they can get a Paperwhite with better resolution, waterproofing, and more storage (2x more for the base Paperwhite model).So what should you get? If you're more concerned with saving money, go for the Kindle Basic. Otherwise, about thirty dollars more gets you a big improvement.

The lighting is the brightest, whitest and most even I've seen. It's comfortable to hold, easy to read, and just as responsive as my Oasis and my husband's Paperwhite. Highly recommend!
",0.93120229244,electronics,"I had a Kindle touch years ago and had stopped using it. But I want to be able to focus on reading and not pop-ups from other apps so I bought this new Kindle to avoid the distractions of reading on my phone.The device is smaller than both my original Kindle touch and my husband's Kindle Paperwhite. I was able to quickly get connect to the internet and begin downloading Kindle books I checked out via Overdrive. The device can be held in one hand comfortably, and it's lightweight enough to feel quite portable without appearing flimsy.This Kindle has some buggy-feeling holdovers from previous generations: occasional leftover pixels during page/screen pages. However, I find the touch screen to be responsive without being jumpy. The bottom/power button sometimes takes an extra push to activate, or perhaps just needs me to focus a bit more. I don't mind the ""special offers"" and generally ignore them completely, yes, this is a generally annoying feature, but I'd rather spend that $20 on books. The backlight can be adjusted to read outdoors or in your bedroom in the dark (handy if your partner nags about keeping a booklight on).Another reviewer commented on the PPI. Personally, as I don't use the device for pictures/illustrations/detailed charts, I frankly don't care. The images that appear in the special offers are clear enough, and the default sized print is crisp and clean and I have no issues reading without my glasses. If you frequently read books that are illustration/graphic-heavy, you may prefer a Paperwhite or other device.I'll adjust my review if my sentiments change but for now I am very happy with my new Kindle.
",0.87949806544,electronics,"I've been reading on this for a few days now.  It's a little bit smaller than my regular Paperwhite, but the size doesn't bother me any.  I like the smaller size.  I purchased it without special offers as I don't need to see all of that. I'm an avid reader and read A LOT.  I haven't noticed a difference in battery life between this and my Paperwhite.  I have to charge that one daily too.  As I said, I read A LOT.  The front lighting is awesome.  I love that.  Comparing this one with my Paperwhite together with all the settings set, all the same, this one is a little brighter.  The only complaint I have is that when I touch the screen to change the page, I end up having to touch it twice to get the page to turn.  I'm hoping an upgrade will fix this.  All in all, I do like this one a lot.  It isn't perfect, but I do like it.Update:  05/04/2018:Still sticking with my previous review.  Battery update:  If you want to make your battery last longer, I recommend going through your device settings and reading options settings and turning every off that you aren't interested in.  Whispersync?  Turn it off.  I saved a lot of battery life by turning this off alone.  Word Wise, vocabulary builder - all turned off unless you're interested in using those features.  Reading options,  I only have the Page refresh turned on.  All other features are turned off.  Highlight menu - I turned all of that off.  Brightness level - I have that turned down to 12.  I hope this helps.  I noticed quite a difference when I turned some of this stuff off.Update:  07/02/2019:Just wanted to drop a note that there has been an update since I purchased this and it did indeed fix the touchscreen issue I was having.  I rarely have to touch the screen twice to get the page to turn now.  It's much better than it used to be.
",0.08726346544,electronics,"This is the first Kindle I have ever owned or used for more than a couple seconds. My current employer actually told me to pick one up, and I could have chosen any Kindle I wanted. After reviewing the choices I decided to purchase this one, despite it being the cheapest. Honestly, I’m quite thankful.I wanted something of a small size, and a device that would be comfortable and easy to hold with both or either individual hand. I do not need to store a million books, nor do I plan to read in a river, or while taking a shower. If that changes, then I’ll update you on the water resistance of this device ;)As far as the actual devices goes, it is a nice size, capable of shoving into a small pocket in a bag, and is easy for me to palm and hold in a variety of ways. It is extremely light, and I could easily hold this for hours. The touch screen is responsive and flipping pages is easier and faster than I anticipated, while also avoidable when just holding the Kindle to read. I was hesitant about the lack of physical buttons, and although I still wished they were present (e.g. on the sides), I lack no confidence that they will soon be forgotten. Since I read a good bit of technical books, and like to take notes, I was wondering how well this would function. Although typing up paragraphs would be challenging, I was pleasantly surprised with the responsiveness. I will probably leave shorter notes and markers on my Kindle and elaborate more when on a computer or tablet. Although it is certainly not a smartphone or computer, it superseded my expectations.I do not have experiences to compare against, being my first Kindle, nonetheless the screen itself is bright and clear, whites being a light gray, and blacks being… well, dark. I did not find an option to invert the colors (font white, background black), which was unfortunate. I also find it odd the power button is on the bottom. I definitely foresee this being bumped while resting against a surface. At this point, I am also a bit disappointed this does not use USB-C. I am guessing Amazon is saving this for a newer, more expensive device, but honestly, I feel all devices like this moving forward really should have this.Having freedom in my choice here, I am thankful I chose this Kindle variant, and given the price point, I am doubtful anyone would complain once they held it in their hands. Any shortcomings I do have, and minor and I am doubtful they will be an ongoing annoyance. Definitely recommend.

You can also see the percentage while charging and while using the watch. The user manual was very helpful. I read through it quickly before using the watch and found that the features were simple to use and find. I haven’t had to review the manual as the watch is well designed.

",0.95844465545,electronics,"What a great device! The smartwatch/tracker does so much more than the Fitbit that I had for a year and a half before losing it through no fault of mine-watch band is not always secure.  FB screen cracked of its own volition (ongoing, unresolved manufacturing problems). There were other negative issues as well. For the outrageous price, FB is not worth the trouble. FB comes with a 1 year limited warranty.In addition to the 1 year warranty, this company offers an additional year warranty (upon registering it with the company).  This device is exciting so far (I will update this post in 2-3 months). It has numerous functions. At least four (4) more than FB.  They all work. The color face feature is nice and easy to read. Maneuvering through the features is easy. It has a music feature, gps for tracking activities, messaging readout (that one can read…), Find My Device- that works (!) You can also find your phone with it by just activating it.  The device stays charged longer than the FB. Two days after a full charge it’s down to 90%. Not bad. It comes with an easy to understand Manual. Packaging is good. The tracker is larger than the FB. But, it is slender and light. The band feels well made and has a safety catch.I would highly recommend trying this tracker.  Compared to the +$100,00 price tag of the FB that has less features and more complaints (just google them), there is no reason not to buy the Letscom Smart Watch. Especially, given the numerous features, company commitment to their product and warranty provisions.
",0.79195952445,electronics,"I have been looking for a smart watch for a few years now, but couldnt justify to spend $200-$300. I've been seeing these for a while, so finally I decided to give a try, and was pleasantly surprised! Full touch and swipe interface, incredible battery life, heart rate monitor, phone finder, built in alarm (with multiple alarm sets), timer, music control, and a neat little ""Relax"" mode that guides you to time your inhale and exhale at the interval of calming vibrating pulses.Aside from the fitness abilities, I purchased this mainly for the quick notification glances, rather than constantly picking up and unlocking my phone everytime it dings, a split second wrist flip saves the hassle. I did have a bit of trouble pairing via bluetooth as the instructions say specifically not to pair via your phone's bluetooth, only via the app... After about 30 minutes of trying, I found out that contrary to their instruction manual, you do indeed have to pair with your phone's bluetooth via the phone settings (as with any other BT device), and then go into the app and pair there to start tracking your steps. It also has a neat little feature in the app that lets you see the daily leaderboard of other people who have the watch and created a free account, so you can see how many steps everyone's taken in the day. Not essential, but fun and inspiring little mini game.Overall, very satisfied for the purchase, incredibly satisfied for the price. Clearly a lot of time has been put into making the UI and settings robust and full featured, and coming from a fitbit size band, this bigger screen for notifications is definitely a welcome change!

",0.05782234746,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.08309632546,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971546,electronics,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.

When you activate it the classic blue glow will fall into the red, giving you the visual display that your privacy is being protected.• The sound performs exactly what it’s built for. I found no issue in testing in an open living room. The volume goes to great levels as once again, for a 360-degree smart speaker, Amazon reigns supreme.• Testing all ranges of music, I found that that bass to be rich and powerful. My colleague has the previous Echo Plus and she states that there is an improvement in the bass with this Echo. An overall rich sound when a piano came in and a warmer outcome when acoustics came into play (You’ll get the bass experience when you hit those hard beats).• Like any other model, the Bluetooth connectivity between a third party stereo works flawlessly. I tested this out with some Bose surround sound, and nothing but clear music. You can also pair the Echo if you have smaller / weaker speakers. Both together will pump up the experience.• The connectivity is so flawless that buying two of these devices (or use Echo’s previous versions, if you have one) and put them in separate locations doesn’t make this a bad idea. You’re going to get great quality in music without paying an am or a leg for it.• I have to appreciate Amazon for not pushing their music platform. They offer the usual Spotify (which I used) but also Apple Music, Deezer, TuneIn, even BBC sounds. You’re getting a lot more features than just a basic smart speaker.• Using Google Home for over a year I can say that just saying “Alexa” felt more natural than saying “Ok Google.” Not to mention having Alexa listen to me every time I said: “Alexa” (Google Home users will understand this).• Like before, smart applications fit like a glove in this system. I only used it for lights and the Echo was spot on. This feature is more common than ever on any smart speaker, and the Echo does what it’s supposed to do.• I admire the organization of the app because it’s your remote control on anything you want the Echo to do. Turn off lights, switch music, mute volume, install new features, and so forth. We all carry our phones like carrying our driver licenses when going outside. This day in age I’ll always prefer an app than a physical remote.• I did some Alexa calls on this and found only clear responses and answers (this will depend on your Wi-Fi).• I would give 70% of Alexa sounding more human.• Everything is in the cloud so, you don’t need to worry about manual updates. All taken care of.• As I mentioned before, everything else is the same in a smart speaker. Ask for the weather, traffic, upcoming appointments, and all other general questions. I didn’t test all of them because…well is the same technology as last year.• The biggest difference in my book is the price. Newer and cheaper.Cons and Oks:• No Zigbee controller. This isn’t much of an issue, but if you already have a smart house layout than you’ll need to spend some extra time configuring with the Echo. The issue for this is that it puts more work on the Echo than you need. Also, there may be some smart devices that won’t work on the Echo because of this. I know last year's models had some connectivity issues with Philips Hue bulbs. Keep an eye out for which smart devices are compatible with the Echo.• I did notice that the app slows down when you put a lot of apps and smart applications in the Echos. I tested a lot of features out that require a decent amount of downloads, but the results did create a delay in the app. I have to assume without Zigbee’s software, if you have a lot of smart applications connected to the Echo, and with the general apps you use, there will be a delay in the long run.• The Echo gets loud. Loud enough that you’ll get some distortion when you’re around 95% in volume. The effect is shown when a lot of bass is begin made. Please note that 90% and up is booming your entire house.• Compare to Google Home, Alexa still isn’t the brightest smart speak in the family. For the basic day to day task it works fine, but those random questions that we tend to have throughout the day Alexa doesn’t deliver. Alexa will usually provide you with a quick one-sentence summary (Unlike Google, it would provide you a short paragraph.). This issue doesn’t happen all the time, but you’ll notice it when it does.• I’m trying to learn Spanish, so asking smile Spanish questions with Alexa is not reliable. Example I will say “Alexa, what does “Qué estás haciendo” in Spanish mean (What are you doing?)? Alexa will say “What are you happy.” I’ve been studying for 6 moths so my speech on that sentence was spot on, but Alexa. Not a reliable study buddy.• I had the first version of the Echo and all I can say is I miss the rotation ring. Bring it back Amazon.• The design is nothing new. It’s built very solid, but it’s identical to Echo Plus 2. My colleague had the Echo Plus and putting them aside there was no way you can tell the difference (a nice note if you want to steal your friends and replace it with the last version).• Even the sound is almost similar to the previous Echo. Both are fantastic, but almost the same.Bottom Line:It’s a great smart speaker system, but almost identical in every way as its previous model. There is nothing wrong with that because Amazon does put in a lot of features into this Echo that makes this right in the top three (Google Home, HomePods, and the Echo Family). It’s accurate, excellent sound, and lower in price than its previous model.Some concerns are the effects in the long run with those who have a decent amount of smart applications, and making sure the compatibility can be performed accurately. Also knowing the limits of what Alexa can and can’t do as the hardware is identical to its previous version. I wouldn’t be surprised if you want to just read Echo’s previous model amazon reviews. Trust me when I say that they’re almost identical in sight and performance.In the end, the reason it doesn’t matter about the flaws is because the price is well worth what you’re getting. It’s a machine that I can see using it every day for the simplest things such as setting up an alarm to enjoying it in small parties. I will say that if you’re planning to use your surround sound stereo connected to this, then this is a must buy. You pay a heavy price for a HomePod, enjoy a generic performance for a Google Home, and are presented with an overall user-friendly experience with the Echo 3. Cheaper than its predecessor and the worth every penny.Overall: A tiny upgrade from its previous model, but still an excellent experience in sound for all.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer
",0.94468158548,electronics,"I purchased my first Alexa Echo 1st Gen two years ago and I fell in love right away! It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1.  This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons.

Please note that 90% and up is booming your entire house.• Compare to Google Home, Alexa still isn’t the brightest smart speak in the family. For the basic day to day task it works fine, but those random questions that we tend to have throughout the day Alexa doesn’t deliver. Alexa will usually provide you with a quick one-sentence summary (Unlike Google, it would provide you a short paragraph.). This issue doesn’t happen all the time, but you’ll notice it when it does.• I’m trying to learn Spanish, so asking smile Spanish questions with Alexa is not reliable. Example I will say “Alexa, what does “Qué estás haciendo” in Spanish mean (What are you doing?)? Alexa will say “What are you happy.” I’ve been studying for 6 moths so my speech on that sentence was spot on, but Alexa. Not a reliable study buddy.• I had the first version of the Echo and all I can say is I miss the rotation ring. Bring it back Amazon.• The design is nothing new. It’s built very solid, but it’s identical to Echo Plus 2. My colleague had the Echo Plus and putting them aside there was no way you can tell the difference (a nice note if you want to steal your friends and replace it with the last version).• Even the sound is almost similar to the previous Echo. Both are fantastic, but almost the same.Bottom Line:It’s a great smart speaker system, but almost identical in every way as its previous model. There is nothing wrong with that because Amazon does put in a lot of features into this Echo that makes this right in the top three (Google Home, HomePods, and the Echo Family). It’s accurate, excellent sound, and lower in price than its previous model.Some concerns are the effects in the long run with those who have a decent amount of smart applications, and making sure the compatibility can be performed accurately. Also knowing the limits of what Alexa can and can’t do as the hardware is identical to its previous version. I wouldn’t be surprised if you want to just read Echo’s previous model amazon reviews. Trust me when I say that they’re almost identical in sight and performance.In the end, the reason it doesn’t matter about the flaws is because the price is well worth what you’re getting. It’s a machine that I can see using it every day for the simplest things such as setting up an alarm to enjoying it in small parties. I will say that if you’re planning to use your surround sound stereo connected to this, then this is a must buy. You pay a heavy price for a HomePod, enjoy a generic performance for a Google Home, and are presented with an overall user-friendly experience with the Echo 3. Cheaper than its predecessor and the worth every penny.Overall: A tiny upgrade from its previous model, but still an excellent experience in sound for all.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer
",0.94468158549,electronics,"I purchased my first Alexa Echo 1st Gen two years ago and I fell in love right away! It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1.  This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons.

",0.01448836949,electronics,"This is by far, the best Echo / system we have owned from Amazon.We purchased 2 of the generation 3 Echos and an Amazon sub as a package (saved $80 + an additional $60 for taking the Amazon store card) to replace the Bose speaker / Echo Dot we had.We now have room filling sound as good as the Bose combo without having to physically turn on the speaker every time we wanted music.Even without the sub, the sound is robust and rich from each of the linked speakers.  The addition of the powered Echo sub fills in the lows to make it an immersive experience.Setup was fairly easy.  My only complaint was that I had trouble renaming the 2nd Echo itself.  Amazon keeps calling it another wacky name.  Overall, it took less than 5 minutes to link all 3 speakers together and be listening.Would I purchase again?  You can count on it.
",0.83734059349,electronics,"I bought an Echo and an Echo Dot. What a waste of money. They're basic; real basic. My fault for not truly understanding what I was buying. It can answer some simple questions with simple answers and do a few smart home things and has ""skills"" but that's about it. Isn't that enough? No, it isn't. I guess I thought I was getting something smart, something I could engage with, seek intelligent replies from, something connected to the world wide web of knowledge. Guess I was wrong. I got a stupid little automated squawk box; a borderline parrot. Guess I got bought. For all our great advances in technology, we're clearly still in our technological infancy. Get back to me when I can say ""Computer, describe to me quantum physics in layman's terms. Explain to me the theory of relativity. What exactly is gravity; are there gravity particles? What is the meaning of life?"" The answer to the latter better be: 42. Another big gripe is that it's constantly trying to sell me something -running through a whole dales pitch -instead of just doing or playing what I asked, or it tells me what it's about to do even though I just asked it exactly that. Now I know why it's called, Echo. I'll be getting rid of it soon. Anybody wanna buy a stupid, smart device?

",0.08730396650,electronics,"We’ve been using the Ring Peep Hole Cam (formerly called the Door View Cam) since its release in June 2019.  Our Peep Hole Cam is part of a comprehensive Ring security and camera system in an urban environment on a busy city street.What works:When first released, the Peephole Cam had a major streaming latency problem.  When motion was detected or when someone rings/knocks, it took ten seconds or more for the camera to stream the video to the user’s phone.  Ring recently released a new ""Rapid Ring"" app--it's a separate app that completely eliminates this video streaming latency.  It works well, and is designed as a companion to the full-featured Ring app.The physical design of the Peep Hole Cam is great--much smaller form factor than the other Ring doorbells, battery is inside the door where it stays at room temperature and is less likely to be stolen.  Battery power, even on a busy urban street, lasts for months--the battery is also easy to change when needed.  The appearance of the device, both outside and inside, is quite good.  It's modern and doesn't degrade aesthetics at the door.What doesn't work:Ineffective Custom Motion Zone ControlsWhen the Peep Hole Cam was released, Ring said that its primitive means of setting custom motion activity zones on its battery and solar powered cameras (including the Peep Hole Cam) would be updated to the more effective custom motion zone setting capability of its AC-powered cameras.  As of this writing, Ring has not released this update, meaning that if you’re using the Peep Hole Cam on a busy street there will be scores of false positives even when the device is set to the least sensitive setting.  The custom motion zone setting capability is so imprecise as to be useless, and all the false positives become annoying.  Since motion alerts don't work well, we have reluctantly turned them off, which limits the value of the camera as a home security device.Knock Sensor IneffectiveWe have the knock sensor set on its most sensitive setting, but the sensor has never once activated based on someone knocking on the door.  This feature simply doesn't work, at least not with a solid wooden exterior front door like ours.Poor Field of ViewAs mentioned in our original review, the camera’s field of view does not cover the lower area in front of the door, so it cannot be used to monitor packages.Please see the attached two photos--one photo is of the front of our place, showing the Peep Hole Cam mounted in the front door.  The other photo shows the view from the Peep Hole Cam.  Note that the entire area in front of the door even including the stairway leading up to our front door, which extends out for about six feet, doesn’t appear in the Peep Hole Cam’s field of view, while the camera does show--of no security value--lots of sky.  It’s remarkable that Ring, an Amazon company with a strategic imperative to reduce package theft, hasn’t addressed this deficiency.Our assessment after 5 months of use:All in all, five months after release, the Peep Hole Cam continues to have serious design deficiencies, that at least for this location, render it less useful than it could be.  We were obligated to purchase a second Ring outdoor camera that we have pointing at our front door to monitor packages and to create motion alerts around the front of our place.While it is great that Ring has addressed the video streaming latency issue,  it's disappointing that they haven't fixed the camera's other deficiencies that really limit the utility of this otherwise good design.  Based on these factors, we continue to rate this camera at three stars.Here’s what we said in June:We had been waiting for the release of this camera.  We received and installed it on June 21.Positives:Small exterior form factor, battery inside the door where it is less subject to temperature extremes and cannot be stolen, knock sensor and integrated peephole with a doorbell and high-res camera.  All great features unique to the Door View Cam in the Ring smart doorbell range.Negatives:When installed in a peephole at normal viewing height, the camera does not show the area directly in front of the door where delivered packages would be left.  The camera lens appears to be sufficiently wide angle but just not aimed correctly--depending on the installation, video recordings will show the sky or the ceiling of the hallway (minimal security value), but not the lower area in front of the door. For this camera to monitor not only visitors but also delivered packages it would either need to have a better fixed camera angle, or be mounted 2-3 feet from the floor, or allow the camera angle to be adjusted by the user.Mounting the Door View Cam on a door facing a busy street even when motion sensitivity is set to the lowest levels generates lots of false positives.  To eliminate false positives requires turning off motion detection since there is no effective way to set and adjust the motion zones.  Ring offers motion zone customization on some of its other cameras.  Why not on the Door View Cam?  [UPDATE: Ring got in touch on this.  They are intending to transition their battery-powered cameras, including the Door View Cam, to the more advanced motion detection used on their plug-in cameras.  No release date yet on a firmware update.]There is significant latency between when someone knocks or rings the doorbell and when the video and doorbell ring appear on one’s phone.  From talking to Ring Technical Support I understand that there is a focus on reducing this latency.The  final negative in the design is that the peephole is low quality--poor optics with lots of distortion and minimal light transmission, making it difficult to see anything with any detail.  Even a $20 peephole viewer has better optics than this $200 state of the art camera.We like Ring equipment and consider it the most functional home security system on the market--generally well-designed, well-performing and reliable.  This camera is a rare miss.  Hopefully Ring will address these problems as much as possible in a firmware update and release a 2.0 version of the camera in the near future.
",0.21775713650,electronics,"Let me preface this review with the following statement: I am never asked for my opinion on security products because of my occupation and expertise. Now that we've got that out of the way... lets discuss this subpar product from Ring.I am a first and last time Ring product purchaser. The Ring Doorview camera was a novel idea... just a poor concept in actuality. To put it short.... it does nothing well (besides being a delayed people watcher).Knock on the door after setting the device up for knocks... nothing. Turn on the live view feature for real time monitoring... its buggy and has a very obvious delay. Those precious seconds of delay are a serious issue... and no one should discount or attempt to belittle that.The field of view from the doorview camera is downright pathetic. You absolutely cannot see the bottom of your doorway. This glaring factoid is a major security issue.I have several videos demonstrating the ineffectiveness of this device. The doorview camera is useless when an individual approaches from an angle or kneeling position. The delayed camera activation even in its most sensitive setting will allow you to be compromised. A person can straddle a wall, kneel under the camera and walk away before the device can activate!2 hundred dollars for this... no way!I will readily admit that I purchased this device thinking that it would have an adequate field of view... and this isnt the case. The camera is flawed, the system is flawed, and it is quite simply a rushed to market product that needs further tweaking. I cant monitor parcel deliveries at my door because a high spot on my neighbors wall and the top pf their doorway is more important to Ring!Now, with all of that being said. I must comment on how awesome Rings customer support is. Within an hour of my initial review... I received an email from a customer service representative. The rep. was cordial and worked tirelessly to ensure that I was satisfied with Ring products. The rep. communicated multiple times via telephone and email with me and listened to my concerns.Afterwards, the rep. immeditely shipped a different Ring device to me to try in place of the doorview cam along with a few other things. This level of customer service is awesome however, the replacement device is locked in IR/night vision mode... and only films in Black and White.I greatly appreciate the awesome customer service from Ring... but I will be immediately returning their subpar products to them.So, in short... The Ring Doorview Camera has awful blindspots, is buggy with a seriously delayed response and the Ring Doorbell 2 has software issues that will make it default to ""night vision"" in a very well lit area.Thanks, but no thanks Ring!
",0.1709945250,electronics,"First off, I am an owner of a few Ring products, an IP security camera system and a few Wyze cams. I am frequently asked for my opinion on security products because of my occupation and expertise.I’m looking at the Ring Door View Camera for my apartment dwelling friends and I feel obligated to chime in and write this review after seeing that the most helpful and liked reviews giving the product 3 stars. I am not disagreeing with what is written about the Door View Cameras limited downward field-of-view, but I do have to add that ALL those reviewers are extremely NAIVE.The Door View Camera (and other Ring Video Doorbell products) are exactly what they say they are and do exactly what they say they can do in their name. After all, Ring didn’t name this product “Ring Package Monitoring Camera”. The premise of a video doorbell is to see people who come to your door and work as a two-way communication device to talk to them.So, let’s look at the Door View Camera objectively:1. Looking for a video doorbell you can install utilizing the peephole - check2. Looking for a device that lets you use the peephole but will also let you see what’s going on when you’re away - check3. Looking for a device that will alert you to motion in front of your door - check4. Looking for a device that will let you know when your package arrives - check5. Looking for a device that solely watches your packages - NOPE! Buy a separate camera and point it at your doormat.For a little substance, I’ve included a couple of photos showing the view of my Ring Video Doorbell 2. My Ring doorbell has a wedge kit pointing it down and a corner kit, pointing it slightly right. The screen grab shows the FedEx delivery person walking away after delivering my package, which she kindly placed on my doormat, but your can’t see the package. The RVD2 is installed 4 feet off the ground and even with the additional wedge & corner kits pointing the camera down and to the right, it doesn’t capture the ground in front of the door. If you want to see your package, get a camera to point at your package or your entryway (which you can clearly see in my second screenshot from my IP camera system) that shows exactly where the FedEx delivery person placed the package.>>>>> So the point of this review, don’t give a product 3 (or 1) stars because you hoped to purchase a package watching camera, it is not a fair assessment of the product’s capabilities! <<<<<
",0.550,electronics,"This camera was released two days ago, and I saw it in the morning order it right away because I was waiting for this.A little complain here it didn't email me when it was released in the morning, I saw it when I was browsing. Then later it email me around 4pm in the afternoon.(I subscribed to email me when release) still within one day acceptable delay.Now let me explain why I have been waiting for this. I already have some camera system installed I am just waiting for a doorbell one fit my needs, nest sounds promising but it will need to run new electric cable to work for my house (checked not compatible) And the existing ring support more voltage door bell cable also have battery version but I kind of don't like it installed on the side on my door. Because my front door is angled, so I was thinking we should be able do something through this peephole. That was before they announce this camera :) Then one day, they introduced this camera, then I have been waiting for it ever since. Not saying they steal my idea, it is very simple idea, they are smart enough to see the need and design it. Good job amazon ring team.I got it yesterday and installed everything works as I expected. And the view is awesome, the door view angle basically same as you see in the peephole a little bit wider angle. And all other function same as other ring, also the battery is inside makes more sense and looks not so big from the outside.I will keep updating if I notice any bugs, so far I am just happy with this design and perfect location to install.
",0.83482968850,electronics,"09/29/20019 EDIT:  This device and company is getting more and more frustrating every day.  For the last week, everytime I have an activation I have to log-in to their website, wade through their sales promos in order to see the most recent activation (occurring on both both my Android phone and my Android tablet).  The ability to directly go to Live View is gone!  I've tried uninstalling and re-installing the most current version of their app...no change.  Guess that it is time (again!) to contact their Help line...08/20/2019 EDIT:  Ring came out with an upgrade to their motion detection.  The new ""Advanced"" detection allows you to set three zones either on or off.  The bad part for many users is that the zones radiate outwards from the camera face: Left, Center and Right.  I prefer to know who / when someone is approaching from either side of my front door or when they are standing in front of the door.  What I need in ""Advanced"" motion detection is the ability to set ""dead"" zones for depth (further out from door so that passing vehicles and pedestrians  do not trigger alerts...NOT Left, Right or Center right in front of the camera.  The new motion detection also adds additional digital signal processing that substantially delays notification to the point where a package courier, sales person, etc is already leaving / gone by the time you are notified.My Knock Detection has not worked in a couple of weeks...not even with seriously hard raps to the door.  Time to check out their Warranty.07/25/2019 EDIT:  Pulled the battery at 30 days up-time (charge was at 43%) and replaced it with the spare.  I figure that I will change out the battery on the first of each month as part of my normal household maintenance.The most recent information I received from Ring is that the engineers are still working on the motion and knock issues.  Motion is dialed down so low that people at the front door do not always activate the sensor...but, large trucks (particularly light-colored trucks) continue to trigger random activations.The Live View feature continues to be randomly buggy and slow when you want to see who is at the front door...sometimes it loads quickly and other times it gives up trying to connect after a couple of minutes.The lag time before you can view an Event continues to take five minutes (or more) before you can retrieve and review the most recent Event from the Ring cloud.07/20/2019 EDIT:  Over the last week the device has become increasingly unstable.  The app frequently does not connect.  When trying to activate Live View, it will send a query to activate the device, proceed through an authentication process which includes sending credentials to authenticate the device with the app (this all takes from 45 seconds to several minutes) with the end result that the device cannot be connected at this time.  The wi-fi signal is good, battery is in the 40 - 50% range.The service rep is pleasant to e-mail or talk with...but, she cannot automagically correct or overwrite the technical issues (hardware, firmware and software) this device has.A friend who has numerous wired Ring products (and likes them) is interested in adding this device to his home...my recommendation to him was to wait until V.2 is out (and de-bugged) before investing in the Door View Cam.07/15/2019  EDIT:  Twenty-six days up..battery 57% (still in line for my original estimate of <60 days).Interesting note is that the advertising on Amazon's site now includes a disclaimer ""The placement of your peephole may prevent you from seeing items left at your door.""Gone is the ""up to 6 months battery life"" ad copy...after calling their Ring Team I was told that it is good for 500+/- activations on a charge.Ring Team member confirmed that Knock sensitivity is something the engineers are working on...my device continues to require a pain-inducing, knuckle-jarring hard knock almost on top of the device to register.  The product advertising image of a child knocking way down on the door doesn't work in my particular installation.Ring Team also confirmed that the engineers are working to implement Ring's Advanced Motion Detection into this product...no implementation date given.Ring did switch out my Chime Pro Extender for a simple Chime device...a handy addition to the system that works well.07/08/2019 EDIT:  Nineteen days up and down to 69% battery.  Still working with the motion sensitivity (this is ridiculous!)...currently the sensitivity is dialed so low that you have to be ""up front and center"" for detection.Knock detection is glitchy...requires a Custom setting of 9 (out of 10) to register a knock on my door.Fortunately the rest of my home is amenable to a wired camera installation...unfortunately the front door is not.06/24/2019 EDIT:  Battery life - it appears that my original estimate of up to 60 days may be optimistic....four days up and the battery is down by 10%...extrapolating this data leads to (roughly) 40 days maximum on a charge.  Delivery trucks, cars, joggers, children and dogs all serve to activate the motion detector eating up the battery (as well as any Live View events I initiate).  I had to turn the sensitivity down to where people have to be on the porch, at the door to activate the device...I was hoping for a bit more advance notification (apparently, the device does not support setting up separate motion exclusion zones).  Presumably, if the device is installed on an apartment door in a busy hallway the battery drain would, most likely,  be similar.The photographic quality could be better...images of people at the front door are not as crisp and sharp as the advertising leads you to believe...identifiable...not much more.Original Review:As other reviewers have pointed out...the bottom of the field is approximately 5 feet out from the vertical plane of the door...terrible for monitoring package delivery.  However, nice view of the sky and my porch ceiling.The documentation is shoddy.  Setting up the Knock feature appears easy...but where is the notification button and how do you customize the Knock notification?  Over the past two days I have set it up several times and it has yet to respond with the cute little dialogue box the set-up sequence shows.  You have to repeat the entire Knock set-up process just to change the sensitivity settings.  Loud vehicles passing by set off the device on the most sensitive setting while the medium setting sometimes fails to respond to a direct knock on the door.Do NOT waste your money on the Ring Chime Pro Extender.  The received signal from the Extender was -10db weaker than the original 2.4 signal from my router.  Better to purchase a full range AC 750 (or higher) Extender from one of the reputable wi-fi companies (I used an Amped Wireless AC1200 Extender from Costco).  Which brings me to one of my biggest gripes...this camera is only 2.4 Ghz, it does not have the 5.0 Ghz provision that most other Ring cameras have.  The additional speed and bandwidth of a 5 Ghz connection would definitely cut the lag and buffering time evident in the current system.Glad I purchased a spare battery.  It appears that the claimed 6-month battery life is only achievable in a laboratory setting.  Thirty to sixty days is looking more realistic for battery life.Be prepared to be inundated with marketing directed at you to purchase their Protect Plus Plan (before your system is even set-up they start pushing their most expensive monitoring plan).Summation: It works...BUT, there is a lot of room for improvement in the device and the app.  I do not appreciate being the beta tester for a supposedly finished, market-ready product.

",0.74861437150,electronics,"I've just received this a few days ago after waiting months for its release. Installation is straight forward, fits and looks great on the door. Removed my old Ring (Gen 1) from my account and added this one. All went smooth activating it on my iPhone and linking it to the Ring Chime, alexa and iPad.  I also use a mac computer which I have the Ring app installed and worked perfect with the old Ring. This camera will not show on my device list so I can't see recordings or view live from my mac. The only device that shows up is the Ring Chime. Thinking it was the app, I un-installed and re-installed with the same results. I went a step further and setup my old Ring as a second device and it shows up on my mac and can view that as I did before.  Called Ring support (whom are very nice) and they told me that there is a known technical issue with software or firmware causing this product not to work on mac or Windows 10 apps.  Really????  Also, this only works on 2.4GHz wi-fi. Being such a new product you would expect 5GHz connectivity.This product should have never been released until this major glitch got ironed out and tested!  I'm told I would receive an email within 24-48hrs of my call. Today is 24hrs so I expect a response tomorrow. I will update as soon as I hear from them.Camera and video are of awesome quality, super crisp images but with one other fault. This unit obviously has one mounting option and that is to replace your peep hole viewer and does what it's supposed to do but camera angle is to high to show bottom of door where most packages are left. I do have a side walk leading up to my door and can see someone walk up before they realize the Ring is on the door but I will be unable to monitor packages to make sure they are still there.  I hope thy can fix these issues with a firmware update instead of a V 2.0 camera. For a high end price of 200.00 all of this should have been thought of and tested before release. I will wait just before return period is up and if these issues are not fixed, it's going back.Conclusion: Great idea, great hardware, great support and does work as designed but with the above issue.I will update as soon as I hear from Ring.******Update******I have been contacted by a Ring representative and was told that the app for mac has not yet been updated and is pending as of now. They are working on it.During the first week, this device became unresponsive to all motion and doorbell button alerts. I had to reset the device twice to get it working again. Working fine now. Also, to get the knock sensor to work, I had to change the knock detection setting to high. Works now.As far as the camera angle is concerned by not being able to view your packages, I am amending my initial review by saying that this is a ""Door View Camera"" and is designed as such. It replaces your peep hole viewer and adds doorbell, motion alerts and video. If you need specific aim at your front porch area, I would suggest getting a Ring device that is designed to mount to your liking.I have updated to 4 stars based on the personal support I've received. Hope to update to five pending the mac app compatibility and stability of this device.
",0.76482957650,electronics,"UPDATE:Took one star off - the cover won't stay on and is always falling off when anyone closes the door, and the battery life is nowhere near 6 months - my guess is probably about 40 or 50 days tops - and our doorway is not at all busy======================What another review mentioned - the device works pretty much as described but the camera should really be aiming low to cover parcel placing positions instead it shows me the ceiling of my porch - what use is that? Also, the alexa connection to the device is SLOW - if you are hoping to get a snappy response from Alexa when you say ""show me the door camera"" you are out of luck, you'll be waiting 10 seconds - doesn't sound much but it's faster for me to answer the door. Also, the install needs a SINGLE video showing installation - it's not all that obvious.
",0.07583844750,electronics,"We live in a third floor apartment with a door facing an exterior breezeway and this camera was just what we needed for security. Our front door is the only entry or exit for our apartment so we now have a 30 second video record of every entry and exit plus anyone approaching or even walking past our door. The $3 per month fee is well worth the price. Video quality is great during the day or night (see photos), and we can view from our phones or on our TV with our Fire TV stick. It also sounds a chime on our Echo Dot when anyone rings the door bell or knocks on our door.
",0.550,electronics,"For a product to be on the market for just a short while, it seems to have a few too many complaints to have to not have a decent review period. I would like to respond to some of them. 1.The angle of view seems fine to me. I don't need to see the floor for a package delivery. When I get a package, I am usually home and pick it up right away. If I am gone, I don't need to see it anyway. 2. Motion sensativity can be adjusted low enough that I don't get alerts from the street. 3.I have a storm door in front of the camera and have no problem with viewing during the day, and by turning the night view off as directed the HD camera at night is a crisp black & white view. I have only one small complain not related to the function of the door bell. It deals with the time it takes to charge the battery pack. I bought a second battery pack. Problem solved.
",0.86185276551,electronics,no review,0.62447536352,electronics," I haven't had a real alarm clock in over a decade. This looked like a neat concept, and it was a good price, so I decided to try it out. It really made a huge difference in how I feel in the mornings. I suffer from anxiety and sometimes wake up with my heart racing when my alarm clock startles me. Even changing to the most relaxing tones didn't really help. This alarm clock totally solved that issue since it very gradually makes it light, before it makes any noise at all. I've found that I usually wake up to the light before the sound goes off, even if I am dead tired.This alarm clock has a ton of features and you can customize literally every single aspect of it, right down to the RGB color adjustment. You can chose to wake up to FM radio, or pick one of their relaxing nature sounds. The nature sounds are really nice and high quality. I find myself laying there listening to them for a few minutes on some mornings.If you want to totally transform your mornings from getting shocked out of bed, to waking up very peacefully and naturally, this alarm clock is great. For the price, you really can't beat it!
",0.76371967852,electronics,"I’ve never been a “morning person” and alarm clocks have historically been loud and obnoxious options to waking up, so I decided to try this. Now it’s not magic, it hasn’t made me all of a sudden cheerful in the morning but it’s a much more calming alternative.Other than the obvious reasons for trying this kind of clock, this particular one has many awesome settings! It has multiple different levels of lights, along with different colors of lights. It had an alarm function, a clock function. It can also double as a sound machine that you can play soothing sounds at night. When using the alarm function the sunrise comes on 10 minutes before the alarm goes off. You can also plug your phone into it for charging. I love the versatility of this alarm clock and the instructions are. Very easy to follow.You should get it.
",0.9453019552,electronics,"Adore this alarm clock! There are so many features I was concerned that I'd be overwhelmed with setting it up. It took me about 5 minutes to set the time, both alarms with gradual lighting, and sleep settings. The radio took a little longer only because of the number of stations available in my area.Features I love:* All the wake up options! I'm a radio fan but I tried the birds/nature sounds and I think I like it better.*I need white noise to sleep at night and the rain sounds and ocean waves are perfect for me. I really love the gradual light at night, it helps me unwind.  I love setting it for a few minutes or a long time. I have mine set for 45 minutes.*At night I really need a blackened room. And I love being able to turn the clock off.*Two alarms are perfect for my husband and I.*Multiple colored lights gives me a nice change that I enjoy.
",0.9243821552,electronics,"I have never seen an alarm clock like this.  It has so many features. You can chose color morphing or set it on 1 of the 7 solid colors.  They are bright and beautiful.  It's definitely a feature that sets this apart from other alarm clocks. Everyone will love this feature .... especially kids and teens.  I personally hate waking up to a traditional alarm sound.  I don't like to start my day by being startled. So I really apprichate that this has 7 different sounds to chose from as your alarm.  A tradtional beep, birds singing, the sound of an ocean, stream, windbell, soft music and piano music. You can also set the radio as your alarm.  It also give you the option to relax and fall asleep to 3 calming sounds. The sounds of a forest, river and of rain.  This might help anyone who has trouble falling asleep. 
",0.87925958652,electronics,"I bought this clock to simply see how well it works. I have sleep issues and waking up is just one of them. I wake up before sunrise most of the year.The sunrise, fade-in light is a great alternative to a sudden, jarring light when it comes to waking me up. Even the sound does a fade-in to full volume. I like it better than my former, loud alarm and flashing light that I had been using. It feels more like waking up to a natural sunrise than it does waking up to alarm from an unsuspecting sleep.Speaking of fading in, everything is adjustable. The time it takes to get to full brightness, how bright, and how loud the alarm is. The instructions guide you through a methodical setup but they are simple to follow and very clear. Well worth the quick read.I don’t think I will use the sleep sounds to fall asleep but it has the same sleep mode fade-out adjustability as it does in its wake mode.This thing even makes for a great reading light. I would recommend it to anyone who likes waking up naturally as opposed to having an alarm clock jar them awake.
",0.84322345352,electronics,"Got this clock for my son who recently moved out but before I handed it over It looked so neat I I decided to give it a try out.  Pretty sure I’ll be keeping it.  The clock has numerous functions besides telling time. You can fall sleep listening to a variety of sounds such as rain. The light also changes colors and you can choose which you like.  There is an FM antenna attached to the back as well so you can listen to music. The alarm clock allows you to wake up to sounds, the radio or a standard beep noise.  The battery is chargeable too. It’s lightweight but not cheaply made. While I haven’t had it long I don’t expect any issues.  You definitely need to read the manual to be able to fully utilize all the functions this clock offers.  I love the different colors and the ambient sounds.
",0.90957945652,electronics,"This alarm clock is priced very well for its features and size. I was looking at some of the other brands available and they were all much larger and over twice the price! The alarms are easy to set, the sounds are nice, and the light is super bright. I find myself waking up naturally to the light before the alarm sounds without feeling groggy. Also I don’t think I’ve snoozed it once since buying it. Big fan of the wake up light now!The brightness of the clock display is adjustable, there are several alarm sounds (nature sounds and classic beeping), the light has so many levels of intensity, and there are even two alarm slots so I can have a weekend alarm and a weekday alarm!One drawback about this light is the radio function doesn’t seem to scan and find stations very well. For me that’s not an issue at all since I like the alarm sounds much more than waking up to a radio station.Overall very pleased with my purchase!
",0.8003681352,electronics,"Alright let me start off by saying I am VERY VERY glade I ordered this.  This alarm clock (especially for the price) as a lot of features.  I won’t get to heavily into all of them as you can read their product description for more info.  So with that being said I want to point out a few of the features that impressed me.  First off it has a USB charging port in the back of the clock for charging external devices (I’m actually using it to charge my iPhone 7 Plus while writing this review so it does work and works great) as well as a compartment in the bottom of the clock with batteries (it comes with batteries already in) in case of a lose of power. Don’t forget to remove the protecting insulating paper tab here so the batteries can do their job!  I took a picture of it for Reference.  The speakers on this thing are very loud, built in fm radio works surprisingly well, the button layout is each to reach and simple, but above all.  The primary light.  It’s amazon.  The functions and multi color possibilities are awesome. I took couple pictures of a few for an example.  There is a lot more to this alarm clock so I highly suggest you order one and find out for yourself !!
",0.24692475852,electronics,"First, let me start by saying that I am not a morning person. I was the guy that set four different alarms in different places just so that I wouldn’t actually turn them off in my sleep. Yes, it happens...When I say that this alarm clock changed things for me, I am not exaggerating. I don’t know if everyone will ha e the same experience, but this dramatically improved my mornings.The clock itself gradually increases in brightness prior to “going off” (I set it to start 30 min early). I wake up to a fairly natural sounding birds chirping (one of several programmable alarms). It actually reminds me of some fond memories of waking up naturally on early summer mornings as a kid... I miss having nothing to do. I have mine set to only 3/4 brightness. It gets VERY bright!I found the manual a bit confusing at first, but when I actually set to work and just filled the directions step by step things went easily. The only problems I had were when I thought I would just set things assuming what they were. I should have followed the instructions.The radio works well, but I don’t personally like waking up to morning radio, so I don’t use it.I have not set and used the dusk set feature as I don’t spend much time in my room prior to bedtime, and I honestly have no problem falling asleep most nights. I’m luckier than my wife. Speaking of my wife, she isn’t really all that bothered by the light as it is on my side of the bed. It does not really wake her up as well as myself as I have it on the nightstand right next to my face. I have not had issues with facing away, but I could see there being a bit of a diminished effect of the “wake up light” effect if you are not facing the clock. It is bright enough to move away from the bed though if everyone in the room needs to be up at a similar time.I recommend the product especially if you have trouble getting up while it’s still dark (especially in the winter) like me.The price is less than I paid for my old Sony dream machine that had fewer features.
",0.07133692552,electronics," After using this alarm clock, I will not go back to using a standard phone alarm. It helped wake me up more gently using light becoming incrementally brighter for a set amount of time before the alarm time. Then, it plays a selectable tune with adjustable volume. I also like to have it in a room set at a warm soft glow as a night light before going to sleep. It is fairly large, so if you need it to produce a lot of light, it certainly can. The tone of light is made to resemble a sunrise, which is nice. Also, there is an option to turn off the time display while the alarm remains active, a feature I always use.
",0.95544469453,electronics,"I just got these and have already used them for Listening to music as well as playing games. The mic works great and is sensitive but not to sensitive, I come across clear when talking to team mates and The noise cancellation is really good as well I have by PC set next to my TV and while the TV is on and I'm playing i cant hear the TV which is awesome since the TV speaker is right next to me. I also really like the camouflage headset i bought just looks cool especially with the symbols on both sides lighting up pretty cool. For the price I can say these are defiantly worth it. The bass for listening to music is great. Definitively a great purchase.
",0.9921106153,electronics,"We bought this particular headset for the great price and because it specifically stated in the product description that these headphones are compatible with the Nintendo Switch.The shipping speed was on point, we had our item delivered only one day after ordering.The sound quality and outside noise cancellation is excellent, as is the comfort and wearability.We were disappointed to discover that the grid on the side of the box shows that the microphone is not actually compatible for gameplay on the Switch. I feel that this fact should have been very clearly stated in the product description. I would have rated this product 5 stars across the board if it weren't for that one thing.
",0.24976649953,electronics,"I first got the headphones with 1 day shipping through prime because the headset I use for the ps4 bit the dust. I was unfamiliar with the brand, but did some research and liked what I heard.So when they arrived, I opened the box and was initially shocked by the size, and then again with how light they are for how big they are. However, despite the weight they don't feel limp or flimsy.Sound quality is good, a little shifted towards the bass end of the spectrum, but I know that's a selling point for a lot of people. The material the mic boom is made form is really stiff and doesn't want to flop around with head movement.My only complaint is that I get sweaty with how padded they are, but that is mostly due to me living somewhere where it is still 90 degrees F in October. Excellent headphones.I also like that the LEDs can be toggled, Sometimes I don't want everything I own to have Gamer Brand Gamer Glow (tm)
",0.23124101853,electronics,"Really nice set for the money. But snug on the bottom of your ears after an hr. Or so...sound quality is very good. Mic pick up n good but some times to good. As it may pick up your sound off your ear speakers and throw back on the game and make an echo. So keep the mic away from the headphone speaker. But I would buy again for sure.
",0.94682031953,electronics,"This is the second headset I have owned, First headset was a cheap headset. This headset is a much better improvement over my previous without having to spend fifty to a hundred bucks.I have had it for a few weeks now and still works great after many hours of use. I am using it with an XBox One with the new style controllers. No adapter needed.Sound quality is great and the mic is crisp and clear for other users across the wire. The headphones are comfortable for me after a long time wearing them, no problem there.Sound cancellation is great as well. Maybe not so good for those in my house trying to talk to me :)I would say for the price, these are a great deal.  The seem very durable and should last a long time.
",0.93593680953,electronics,"I really like this headset. It's not like you're buying a $100-$500 headset so don't expect that kind of quality. However, I am surprised about how well the headset works for the money. The material and paint looks good on the green camp version I have. I haven't played for an extended period yet to test the comfort over time but the comfort so far has been nice. It does come with an adapter for use with pc that some have or you can use the 3.5mm jack. I like the inline volume wheel and mute toggle switch. The cord seems durable as well with sturdy connections. I think this headset will last a while and perform well. I can tell when people are left and right in Call of Duty as well so that aspect is actually usable. Some headsets say they do that but you can't tell. I would say I'm really happy with my purchase. The only negative thing I have to say is, I wish the light wasn't powered by USB. I can only use the light on pc or I don't see how I would power it. I wish that part took batteries. I would recommend this headset if you want a low cost headset that's actually worth the money.
",0.81409609353,electronics,"The headset arrived intact and in perfect condition. As expected, the headset is constructed of lightweight plastic materials. It doesn't feel particularly sturdy; I'm not sure it could survive a long fall or a five-year-old's grasp. However, I take pretty good care of my things, and it seems to be built well enough that I will get my money's worth and many hours of use. It's pretty slick looking (I got the camouflage), with chrome accents on the sides, and fits well on my head with intuitive adjustment points. The microphone is easily adjustable and stays in the position I set it in. The mic audio quality is good, as well. The cord appears to be well made, although there is a pinch point on the cord near where it splits into the aux and USB connectors; I will keep an eye on it. I like the lights on the outsides of the headphones; they alternate through a couple of the primary colors. Be aware that they are powered by the USB. I use this on my PS4, so unless I connect the USB to a power pack or similar power source, they aren't on when I use them. Not a big deal since I can't see them while I'm wearing them, anyway. I have already worn them for approximately 8-10 hours of gameplay, and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. The ear pads are very soft and pliable. My only complaint is after wearing the headset for awhile, I experienced some mild discomfort on the top of my head. There is ample padding there, but it's not as pliable as the ear pads. Also, I used the headset to listen to Spotify on my laptop, and the audio quality for music was somewhat lackluster. However, I purchased the headset for gaming, and for that it has delivered and met my expectations. I would recommend this headset to anyone looking for a solid bargain and a capable gaming accessory.

These are better than Turtle Beaches Rcon 50's.These Runmus gaming headphones are better than the turtle beaches I already have. If your buying the lower level of Gaming headphones under 50 dollars or so.The sound quality has a really great balance, with the 50mm speaker compared to the Turtle Beaches Recon50 40mm speakers. The Runmus is able to to give a greater low bass and high trebles. So whether your listening for footsteps or want to feel the sound of a bomb explosion these are amazing.The surround sound does work well. Also depending on what games you are playing and how their sound is set up is dependent how well it will transfer to surround 3D sound. But overall very goodClear mic I have had no problems with the mic at all everyone hears me perfectly fine. Good switch that you can hook to your shirt.The headphone cushion is great and even more comfortable than a Turtle Beach Recon50.

",0.99075394953,electronics,"Tons of positives for a great price. Plenty of room for a giant headed person like me. Ear cups stay on without slipping. Sound is great. Can really hear those footsteps around the corner. Mic quality is also quite dandy. Camo accent is a fantastic touch. Only bad thing is because it is really new the headset clapping force is really strong. The ear cups are so large they press on my jaw. It only feels bad when I'm talking trash a ton. Again this is because I have an extremely large head. My wife didn't feel it at all.
",0.83943438553,electronics,"We got this headset as a replacement for a different one that was starting to fall apart (from a different company). This headset is a great value, under $30, and it is very comfortable. The sound quality is good, especially for the price. We like the adjustable mic and the different color options (we got camo). We were a little disappointed that the LED lights need power from a USB cord, which makes it a little cumbersome to work with.
",0.80924177254,electronics," Love the essentials package as it gives you trackers for all that is important!! I do wish the tile sticker was a bit smaller but hey it's already there smallest one!
",0.7916736654,electronics,"Bought for very low-energy/trauma wildlife research (grassland tortoises within enclosure). IPhone6s won't sense the Tile within 25' with direct line of sight, not within 10' if there's a bush, skinny tree or chair in the way. To press the ""find phone"" button and my phone rings, but the phone can't find the Tile when I'm basically standing over it... so not particularly useful. Advise? Let's see if it lasts through a rainy day...PS: the glue didn't last 100hours, either. Let's see if the battery's actually good for 3years, particularly once you actually power it on.
",0.23530623354,electronics,"With the advent of tracking tags, tile was initially the premier name of what seems to be a broad market now. I used to rely on tile for the first few years until i grew tired of having to replace the whole device when the battery ran out after a year. The replacement plan was a rather expensive form of subscription which turned me away once alternatives with replaceable batteries. The most remarkeable part about that was the fact that now no-name devices get rebranded by different distributors. Anyway, as time went by, tile responded and at first made the batteries in the high-end tile sport replaceable although with a fairly high price tag. Now, the essentials pack landed on my door step and I was ready for another look.The pack includes a redesigned slim, which is now in the form factor of a credit card (unlike the original square design). The thickness is slightly reduced and now more compareable to two creditcards stacked. The idea is to place it in your wallet to keep track of that.For larger models that may be an option but the thickness and stiffness of the slim made it uncomfortable for me to actually use in my somewhat minimalistic wallet. However, my back pack didn't have those limitations and is now trackable.The Essentials don't include the high end sport, but one tile Mate. That is neither waterproof nor as attractive as the sport, but the CR1632 battery is now ... you guessed it ... replaceable! The other improvement is that the tile Mate is now capable to connect to your phone over up to 200 ft (double the original). That's too far for the louder sound to make a differencebut in general use it does help to overcome background noises more effectively. The dual color design with the silver tile button is also more attractive than the drab original (but a far cry from the Sport).There are two new devices included that are not even listed on the tile website (yet). The tile Sticker is a very different concept from the tile mate. The battery is not replaceable, but it's rated at 3 years. At the same thickness as the Mate, it's round and significantly smaller than the Mate (or especially the even larger Sport). There is no attachment loop as it's meant to be stuck to something with the adhesive backing, as the name ""Sticker"" may suggest.New (to me) is also the Premium Service which costs $2.50/month when paying on an annual basis or $2.99/month when going month by month. Included in this service are features like Smart Alerts, extended warranty, location history (30 days), and free battery replacement. The latter only applies to the devices that allow for a replacement, of course, but the Smart Alerts are interesting. It's a type of geofencing that basically determines your location (based on your smartphone) an the location of the included devices. Tile uses a message ""It looks like you left home without your 'Keys'"" as an example. I won't get far without keys anyway, but there sure are applications where you may benefit from such nanny service. (It's just difficult to make it useful for items you only occasionally need, and not to become annoying the other times.)Overall, this is a nice collection of different tile devices although it depends on your application if it's worth the investment. I am currently torn and may come back to render a more definitive verdict.

Some day in the next few years, Tile may actually work reliably and conveniently.My primary complaint: I couldn't find my phone, so I tried finding it using my Tile. But my phone had switched to power saving, and had turned off Bluetooth and Location, so Tile was useless. I was able to turn them on via Google, but off course I could then easily make my phone ring via Google too. If Tile added the ability to turn on Bluetooth and Location via the same button press on its devices, then you'd have something. Until then, I don't really see its usefulness. Buyer's Regret!

All I have to do is to say ""Hey Google, call my cat, an two of her tags (for safety) start to ring so that she knows that I am looking for her.

The adhesive is surprisingly well above average. I bought 8 of these (x2 4-packs) and have them placed on equipment such as tripods, a DSLR camera, a motorized slider, Ronin gimbal, and studio lights. Battery supposedly lasts for 3 years. The app to sync to your device is AMAZING. no latency or lag, very easy to use and you can customize your icons. For instance, for the Ronin gimbal, the icon not only displays the gimble's title I chose, but I've added a picture of the gimbal, and can choose the tune I wish it to play. The Sticker works even when I have it on the opposite end of the house while I'm outside at the end of my driveway (about 150ft away). If you lose signal with the Sticker, the app will notify you (if you activate this option) and will show you its last location before connection loss. I'm a HUGE FAN of the community support. Well done Tile. We're in the process of ordering a few more!
",0.86473619954,electronics,"I bought this because it came with a free Echo.  Used the tiles for my apple tv remote (love it because we never drop that darn thing anymore...its like a popsocket for your apple tv remote HA!).  One is in my wallet and one is on my TCL Roku remote.  It does not work on a TCL Roku remote (no flat surface big enough on that one to stick it down, so I bought a silicone cover for the remote on Amazon and stuck it in there...perfect solution. Haven't found a place for the fourth one yet.Now the reason for four stars.1. One didn't work out of the package. Though tile was AWESOME about it and replaced it immediately after calling in for troubleshooting, it still made it not a five star experience. I haven't tested the replacement yet but I'll assume it works.2. I do feel they are a little expensive even with the free Alexa but that's just a personal opinion and I bought them, so it isn't a deterrent.3. I don't like that they aren't more flexible on what they can go on.  I really wish you got four different shapes so there was some flexibility based on what you are trying to fit (maybe one circle, one square, one rectangle, & one oval...or something like that). They should all also have a small hole for a ring for more flexibility, too. You know if I was being paid to redesign them, which I'm not.4.  Hate that they are designed to be disposable. No battery replacement, just throw it away when it wears out.  Hoping for a youtube video on how to hack these things to replace the battery once mine start to die. I know people figured out how to open the old tiles without replaceable batteries so there is hope.5.  Finally lost one the other day and it was actually hard to find.  I could barely hear it because it was in a blanket in basket.  But it did work in the end.  Not sure how much battery is left because it took me forever to figure out where the sound was coming from.All in all, I still love them, I just like to be thorough with my reviews. My daughter got a tile last year for Christmas in a gift exchange and I've always been jealous of it.  Very glad I have them now to put on the items that you can't page.  Still shocks me that you can't page the Apple TV remote, but that's another review...

",0.13511958755,electronics,"I have a much better security camera system for my home's exterior but thought I might try one of these cams indoors since I have the Ring alarm system and a Ring Doorbell already.  I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't.  None.  Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways.  I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed.  Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house.  Nope.  There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not.  They are not location aware in any way.  The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording.  Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours.  Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room.  I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on.  This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%.  This is with all the 'battery saving options' on.  This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording.  So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing.  I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality.  The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.***UPDATE***Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera.  You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then.  Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't.  Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera.  The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support.  Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.***ANOTHER UPDATE***From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"".  This will be a great update and should have been available on launch.  I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.***ONE LAST UPDATE***Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days.  It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration.  With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set.  They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away.  For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off.  You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc.  Or any combination.  The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can.  This is a great improvement.  They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5.  This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras.  I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.
",0.12626469155,electronics,"Camera performs as expected and works fine. I took away stars since this camera does not integrate with the ring alarm system. Currently there is NO WAY to get motion alerts or record motion ONLY when no one is home. You can schedule times but schedules change often. I don't need an alert and recording every. single. time. I enter a room...Idea that tons of people on the web are asking for: Have an option to record motion only if the ring alarm system is set to away mode! If this were available I would easily give 5 stars. If I had known about this issue I would not have bought the ring alarm system or the ring cam. I assumed a top tier company deeply invested in home automation would be on top of this.
",0.85060751455,electronics,"Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.***UPDATE***Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.Yesterday, Ring updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.Observations.Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a month before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.
",0.17982742255,electronics,"I rarely write reviews. I was really excited about this product so I ordered two. Just got them today and spent 3 calls with support and they don’t work as intended. I had a breaking on my property two weeks ago. Support tried to help with both and unfortunately hours later nothing. The issue for me is that the notifications barely work. It’s a hit and miss if they do. What’s the point if your devices do not get dependable motion notifications? Customer service was nice but unable to help at this point. I had been burglarized two weeks ago and was expecting that this would be great.This is my second review. I have to wait for an appointment next week after an email I received today. I didn’t go into full length yesterday because I was upset. First they told me my first device was defective and to open the second one and that I would get a replacement for the first after a hold of 1 dollar on my card. I wanted to test it looking out my living room window. I’ve had no alerts since at all. My neighbors kids came by and knocked on my door and nothing. If you want to watch a live camera all day and night this is for you. We come and go and I pay ADT to monitor my house. I’m angry because I lost a lot of tools and if this doesn’t do motion alerts whether home or not just find something else.
",0.01066330155,electronics,"Updated review after 24 hours post-installation:I have to say, I am extremely disappointed with Ring’s new release. I pre-ordered this camera primarily due to the price and I now see why this model is $70 cheaper than the Gen 2 at regular price.To start, mounting hardware is no longer included. Amazon is now selling a separate kit for mounting (security screws and screwdriver) for $20. To be fair, I feel like if someone is installing these cameras in their home, it’s a good saving to pass on to them.However, my biggest issue is the build of the Gen 3. Once you plug it in and run through the setup, you can tell that it is inferior to the Gen 2. The field of view in this new camera is a lot smaller as follows:Gen 3 Stick Up Cam (this model) field of view110° horizontal, 57° verticalVersusGen 2 Stick Up Cam Wired field of view150° horizontal, 85° verticalTherefore, you have less coverage (e.g. if you are trying to see a big back yard) and require multiple cameras. The Gen 2 covered my entire back yard with its near fisheye view. I would require two of these cameras to provide equal coverage.Motion zones is no longer editable like it was in the previous model. The motion zones is similar to that of the first Gen Ring Doorbell. It is a semi-circle from the bottom of the screen and you can only make the circle bigger (extending motion zone) or smaller (shrinking motion zone). The top half of the screen is completely exposed and cannot be used to detect motion. The Gen 2 allowed me to have different motion zones and allowed me to customized the zones to cover anywhere on the screen I saw fit. This is important as I do not want my patio to be within the motion detection zone since we are relaxing out there quite often.My issue with the lack of POE as stated in my quick review below stands.Lastly, the quality of the image, while it is claimed to be 1080p appears to be less of that my Gen 2 with POE. It’s possible that the WiFi signal can be blamed (there is a noticeable lag during live view that I contribute to the WiFi),  but the location of my camera is directly beneath my router (~3-5 feet away) therefore cannot be blamed for everything. I have up to 400 mb/s down and 25 mb/s up consistently.I wish these specs were easily available when the pre-order page was still present. I probably would’ve ordered more Gen 2 than these new Gen 3 had I known. Cost cutting is great and always welcomed, but it should NEVER be at the expense of quality on a once excellent product. Naming this camera as part of the Stick Up line is extremely deceiving since it is so different. I would’ve rather they kept the build and cost the same as Gen 2 since they also released the budget Indoor cam as well.Original quick review post-unboxing:I pre-ordered this stick up cam PLUG-IN without the solar power option and received it today. I am extremely disappointed that Amazon/Ring removes the POE input and replaced it with some type of DC plug. I am extremely disappointed and wish I had purchased some more of the second Gen cameras!! Do not buy if you want to use POE.
",0.10872694855,electronics,"Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.
",0.75112634955,electronics,"So the camera is okay if used outdoors. Read others reviews for why exactly indoor use is not great. The biggest disappointment when used outdoors is you cannot set specific motion notification zones like you can with the flood light cam or the other outdoor ring camera. All you can do is slide a sensitivity bar over a general area within the cameras field of view. Does it work...sure...but without zone control its not that great.
",0.78043222455,electronics,"It was easy to set up and is a great companion to my Ring doorbell on the front of the house. It has an excellent field of view and the image itself is very good.Now for the bad: it lost all WiFi connectivity overnight and I have a strong WiFi signal where the camera is located. When I set it up again, it downloaded updates again. This would seem to suggest there were new updates today, even though it grabbed updates when installed yesterday.I gave it three stars because I like what is potentially capable of, and I am realistic about a brand new product on day one. It may take a little time to work out all the bugs so patience is required for the first few months.I should also add that the support rep spoke very poor English and it really got to the point I just wanted to get her off the call. I probably understood about two out of three words from the representative. This was more disappointing to me than the actual failure, but she was able to help me get it resolved - with various request to repeat things.Update day 2: Camera has disconnected from network again, which means I have to go out and push the setup button again and reconnect it to the network. I don't really want to call their support number again because that was such a painful experience. I really want this to work so I am going to have to think about how much patience I have versus my frustration and desire to return it.End of day 2 update: after connecting to the network again this morning at 10:30, it had dropped off WiFi by my return at 5:00 pm. I also noted the battery is down to 75% after two days of “not working”. This is stretching even my patience.Despite the issues I have experienced with this device, I remain a fan of Ring products. I did receive a nice note from Ring customer support offering additional assistance, but he only works on weekdays so I cannot pursue the issue until next Monday. In defense of Ring, they were extremely helpful with my doorbell last spring so I have high confidence this will be resolved - if I can handle the shorter than expected battery life.Beginning of day 3: I placed the camera on my desk, about 3 feet from the wireless access point as a test to see if wifi signal strength is the culprit. Reconnected it to the WiFi network. Battery strength on this beginning of day 3 at 61%. Even if I get this working correctly, I don't believe the battery life will satisfy my expectations.End of day 3. Disconnected from WiFi after a few hours, sitting right beside access point. Discounts signal strength issue. I will work with with support next week to figure this out.FINAL UPDATE: After working with Ring support, they assessed the camera as faulty and had me return it for replacement. Sadly, the replacement worked exactly the same way. This suggests a problem on my network (even though two other Ring cameras are working fine) or a faulty batch of cameras. After working with Ring support again, they forwarded me to a second tier support rep. During our efforts, it stopped responding to the setup button so I was no longer able to work with  this camera. At this point we returned the unit. I was disappointed with the battery life and since they couldn't product a unit that would work on my network I decided it was time to fold. I remain a fan of Ring products in general, but this second example of the ""Stick up cam"" failed before we could do any extensive diagnostics so we will never really know what the problem was. (oh - for you networking folks out there, I did set the camera's mac address to a reserved IP address in my DHCP server. Worked fine for the usual 5ish hours and then lost the network again.)
",0.01703664755,electronics," I did four times of entry/exit front door testing. It ONLY worked once (video + notification). There were no people captured in two other videos, like I attached.  And it missed both video and notification on one testing.The video sync up was also slow. It took about 6 mins to show up the clip in the ring app.I really like the design and easy-installation. But the motion detection is the deal breaker. I have no choice but return it.
",0.19948583855,electronics,"UPDATE 11/15/19:  I've had the camera for two weeks and overall it has performed fine with respect to recording and in freezing weather. The only issue with it is the battery life, if you are planning on putting this camera outdoors GET THE SOLAR PANEL! I've had it up without one because I wanted to see how long the battery would last after being fully charged and for our normal usage. The settings I have it on are: Motion Detection: ON, Motion Frequency: STANDARD, Motion Verification: OFF. Video Settings: Live View - ON, Tap Camera Preview - OFF, Audio streaming/recording - ON, Infrared Lights for Night vision - ON. I also have it linked to the front doorbell so that when it detects motion it triggers the doorbell to begin recording. The traffic in front of the house is steady but not crazy, normal subdivision. With these settings and at the 15 day mark of being up the battery on this camera is currently reading less than 10%. It's a shame that the battery life is on the ""meh"" side, so you either need to have another battery pack as a back up on stand-by or use the solar panel.  I'll be adding a solar panel and will report back how it goes with another update.------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:Overall, I like the simplicity and ease of the Ring system. This is NOT the high-end camera so all you people expecting that at this price point need to get a reality check! READ THE SPECS before you order it, if it does not meet your situation spend the $ and get the high-end one. I already had doorbells (hardwired and battery) along with the security system prior to getting this outdoor camera. The set up was simple enough, just like their other products, it was easy to link it with the alarm base, and set up the motion detection. One feature it does have is the ability to link it with the other doorbell cameras and cameras that I have. For example, if the front doorbell detects motion I can have the camera begin recording and vice versa. You need to really look at the settings in the base unit (if you have the alarm system) to understand what options there are.The camera comes well-packaged and the instructions are very straightforward, the camera is small and very easy to put up. This being said, I do believe it is overpriced, it should be the same amount as the indoor corded camera that is around $59. I have my motion notification settings on ""standard"", we'll see how the battery life goes, will probably get a solar panel for it at some point. The picture quality is pretty clear and the adjustability to get the angles you want are very easy to do with the basic mount it comes with, the package includes all the hardware needed to install it. I would suggest you have someone hold up the camera where you want to mount it at and then look at your phone to see what the view actually looks like BEFORE you actually mount it. The night pic on the camera is decent, a bit better then the DoorbellPro that I have, gives me a nice wide view of the porch, the driveway, part of the street in front of the house, all the way across the street to driveways for those houses. This was a pleasant surprise for such a small camera. The motion detection is simple, it allows you to adjust a zone that you want monitored fairly easily within the app. You will need to charge the battery fully prior to use, the pack has two lights on it, one amber, the amber one will go out once the battery is fully charged. Everything you need to set the camera up with comes in the box. It is small, but solid, camera weight less than 1 lb. I replaced a bullet style that I had with it. The two-way sound works good as well, it picked up a conversation my neighbor was having on his porch and of people walking past the house on the sidewalk. I will probably be getting a couple of more of these, just wish that Ring would bring the prices down a bit. Overall, pretty nifty little camera that does what I need it to do without having to run a bunch of wires all over the place.
",0.80052250656,electronics," Wow, when I received this I was surprised at the quality of the carrying case it came in.  It's the real deal, and when I went shopping for a backpack for one of my other drones they wanted $60 for it!  This package includes spare propellers and landing gears, which you will need if you fly like me.  Bonus cost savings.This drone is on the smaller side, but it has more features than my large drone does, and has a better camera!  And it is so much quieter than my large drone.  My wife complains about my how loud my other drone is, she says she can't even hear this one.The included charger is great, and charges two batteries quickly.  And the fly time on this drone again is longer than my large drone.Oh, did I mention you can fly this drone INDOORS?  I turned on my large drone in the house once, it did not end well.  This guy is small enough to fly around my basement on a rainy day.  My son and I setup a Lego obstacle course to steer around.I've included video taken from the drone, a takeoff and look around my neighborhood.  Also unboxing pictures.One warning: Just because the drone is small doesn't mean it's for little kids.  The propellers on this drone are exposed, keep those little fingers away from the blades!I'm going back outside now, I want to play with the feature that lets you draw a path on the map for the drone to follow.  Even my most expensive drone doesn't do that.
",0.2129532156,electronics," I first bought the HS700 (which I reviewed and liked, though it had a few shortcomings), and I wanted to get one for my son.  I find myself actually preferring this drone over the HS700 (sorry, son!), mostly because of the camera image quality and general ease of use. Here's my pros & cons (and in-betweens):Pro:Super-easy to fly! Any beginning drone pilot will be able to fly this right out of the box.Video and photo quality is visibly better than my HS700Kit includes 2 batteries and an excellent padded zipper carry case.Compact controller folds up very cleverly in travel case.Flight times seemed longer than my HS700, probably over 20 minutes from each battery.My (large) Pixel 3XL actually fits in the cellphone cradle on the controller (without phone case).I like the feed-back sounds for taking photos (camera drive sound) and constant beeping when a movie is shooting.Much easier to access memory card (included!) in the camera than the HS700.Camera has an up and down gimble movement so you can change it mid-flight.Comes with a charger that charges both batteries at once, and it seems to charge faster than my HS700.""In-betweens"" (not really pro or con):Software for viewing and saving photos - I found that I have to get to the prompt on the phone to ""stay connected to this [the drone's] network even though no internet?"" and click a ""yes"" check box. This lets the phone software stay connected to drone for live screen feed (which is only slightly chunky during flight, but totally expected at this level).Not sure if this is intentional, but the drone would not save still photos unless my phone was connected to it. It did save movies without being connected, though.Camera is pretty good (better than HS700), but struggles with auto color balancing in high contrast images, which you can see in my movie. Some people might not care about this, but I notice it.Auto-land button could be dangerous if you hold it too long - it cuts the motors! I think it's a 2 second hold to cut them, so it's not ""broken"" but something to be aware of.  Hasn't happened to me yet, but came close!Cons (sort of!):You can only turn off ""beginner mode"" if your phone is properly connected.The photo & camera shoulder buttons are partially blocked by my cellphone in its cradle, but are still accessible. May not be a problem for someone with skinny fingers or a smaller phone.This is a very nice compact, ""mid level"" drone that they have clearly put a lot of design thought into. I can personally vouch for its durability - I lost it in the sun and flew it into a tree and the drone got stuck!  It then chopped its way out of the leaves (!) and returned home unscathed.  I have crashed my HS700 about 4 times (at less than 30 feet altitude) and its not even scratched and still works fine.  I give it 5 stars because while it's certainly not the greatest drone ever, it's a really fun hobbyist drone and an excellent value.
",0.23239973256,electronics,"I've flown a lot of different drones, from the ultra cheap to the expensive named brands. This drone bridges the categories by not being too expensive like the named brands but flying like one of them. Link up with this drone is pretty simple and straightforward with just downloading the app and following the steps. Take off is just as easy. Handling characteristics in flight are superb and maneuverability is excellent. The video link stays stable even with some distance between the phone/remote and the drone. In fact,  image quality is great from take off to landing and I haven't experienced video lag at all. I feel this drone is just as good as the big named brand drones at a much lower cost. I especially like the fact that it comes with a second battery and a carry case which is specially cut to fit the drone snug and secure. If you're looking for a really good drone and don't want to go broke buying one, this is the way to go.
",0.78191101656,electronics," All I can say is WOW! This is the coolest drone I’ve ever flown. I got it a few days ago and had to wait for the weather to get better so I charged the 2 batteries that it comes with. It comes with a charger that will charge both at the same time (big plus). It also comes with a nice case and rechargeable controller.I finally got a chance to fly it and it was easy once I set up the drone. It holds quite stable in a breeze and the video you can scan up and down from the remote. The app is awesome and has a video that helped me with the setup. There are so many different things that it can do but one I liked was the return home (it started to get away from me once). I’ve got other drones most of them Holy Stone and they keep getting better and better. I’ll probably only buy theirs  from now on. Their customer service is awesome too!!I would give it more stars if I could!
",0.96299928456,electronics," I already have an HS160 pro, which has been a fantastic starter drone but its super-portability and low price comes with some limitations that had me also wanting a little bit larger drone with more features. I’ve had my eye on the HS120D for a while, so when they released this version with the case and the two batteries I knew it was time to upgrade. The case and dual battery package is well worth the few extra bucks over the base HS120D kit that has been out for a while (the base kit has only one battery and no carrying case). It is a really nice case made of premium-feeling materials and holds everything perfectly.I have been having a blast with this HS120D, it is really fun to zip it around and has great battery life. I really like the dual charger. I also like the controller, the joysticks have good feel to them and provide good granular control over the drone’s movements. The camera in this drone is better than my HS160 pro, I am very happy that this model records to an SD card on-board so I can fly out of wifi/FPV range and still be recording. The GPS features seem to work well, the drone can hold its place hovering surprisingly well and the return to home works great.The camera in this drone is good enough for some decent candid footage to share on social media or show to friends, but it would not be mistaken for a dedicated photography drone, mainly because there is no gimbal and the framerate is a touch low at only 25 FPS. If you are trying to get a video to turn out I suggest making sure your flight movements are slow and deliberate. This drone is very fast and agile and it can easily turn and maneuver faster than a 25 FPS camera can keep up with which will give you rather jerky, torn video. If you turn, ascend, and maneuver around slowly and purposefully you can keep the camera more stable and the footage turns out pretty good.I would highly recommend this as a perfect starter drone to anyone looking to give the hobby a try for a low price. I am slowly working my way towards more expensive drones (perhaps eventually the HS720D) but it can be nerve-racking to send all that money literally up into the air, because you WILL crash in the beginning when you are learning. I’ve dumped my HS160 pro several times and even taken two light crashes with this HS120D in the one week I’ve had it (both times my fault). The HS120D survived both crashes and still works great, so it’s a durable drone too. I’m glad they send extra propellers and parts but I haven’t had to use them yet.This would make a great gift for someone who wants to get into drones, its fun and easy to learn on and forgiving of mistakes as well, without risking too much money if (when) they crash it.If you are interested in seeing the camera footage quality please check out the video I made, but be aware that I was forced to cut the resolution down to 720P in order to avoid a ""file too large"" error when submitting this review. I have the full 1080P HD edition out on youtube but amazon will not allow me to link it here. If you shop the way I do I often go to youtube and search for videos on the product I am thinking of buying before I purchase, if you do the same you might find my 1080P version of the video out there.Anyways, I’m looking forward to flying more and getting better at both piloting and capturing videos with this, I think its going to be great for vacations and adventures as well as just something fun to play with around the house.
",0.87508094356,electronics," This is my second drone from Holy Stone.  Overall a great product that I would recommend to others. Many features for the price and easy to fly with one button take off/land and Home feature.  Very good for beginners.  I used it in the video to check for any roof damage from recent storm.Pros: - Easy to fly- Great flight time- Assembled out of the box- came in nice carry case- comes with 2 batteries and double charger and appears to have a low charge time- Return home feature- Nice Pictures- Good flight time- Follow FeatureCons: - Found it a little harder to fly than the Holy Stone HS 700.  Seems to carry a bit more in the wind (probably lighter size)-  The phone holder on the remote was not expandable enough to hold my cell phone in the case, had to take the case off.
",0.80755883556,electronics," Got my hs120D the other day and after charging the 2 batteries plus the rechargeable remote, it was ready to go.  There was nothing  to put together.  Everything came in a handy carrying case.  I took it out for a short fly, mainly because it was cold and windy.  As light as it is, it handled the 15 to 20 mph wind like a champ.  Thanks to gps, which I think is a must.  I have purchased cheaper drones w/o gps and the slightest wind carries them away.  Took several pictures but after about four, I could not take any more.  Not sure why.  Will try again next time but that is why I am giving it 4 stars not 5.  I have another Holy Stone drone and have conferred with customer service and they respond and take care of any problems you may have.  For some reason the video I took doesn't show up on this page, but I think it is of one where I used the follow me mode.  The remote has 3 different speeds for the drone, which is kind of cool, especially for a beginner.  Overall, I would recommend this drone for the quality, price and customer service.  I just updated my rating to 5 stars because after conferring with my customer service agent, I got my problem fixed.  Thank you Holy Stone.
",0.88027739556,electronics," I love this Holy Stone HS 120D drone. I am very impressed how Holy Stone put this awesome drone package together. All items needed for the drone fit well in the travel case. It comes with extra propellers, landing gear, 8gb micro SD card and reader to plug into a PC, two batteries, battery charger, detailed manual,the controller and the drone.I charged the batteries and the controller and took it outside to fly.  I reviewed the manual and went through the initial steps calibrating the drone and locating its gps location. One pointer when calibrating the drone is to hold the drone horizontal first and to rotate your body around until one set of the drones lights stay solid and then in the next step to hold the drone with the camera facing up and the battery down and then rotate your body around until the other lights turn solid.  Once through those steps you push the left joystick down and right and the right joystick down and left and the propellers start rotating ready for take off.  The controller is very reactive to your touch. Push the left controller up and up the drone goes. Once you let go of the controller the drone hovers. I love that feature which allows me to look at my phone and select or move the drone around and not panic because there is time to make the adjustment. Flight time is approximately 16 minutes with one battery.  One would have to recalibrate after changing the battery. Pushing the return home button the drone will come back to where it took off from within a couple of feet.  Another feature I really like is you can set the distance and flight height that the drone flies to. I other words once the drone reaches 30 ft away from you or a certain height the drone stops and will not fly beyond that distance. In settings you can make adjustments.  Another great feature is when in video mode you can toggle a button to add voice to the video.  The video and picture quality is great. Even though it puts your pictures and video on your phone, they are also on the sd card. I think the ones on the sd card are a little better resolution.Overall this is a fantastic, fun drone to operate.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  Holy Stone is a great company. I’ve had other Holy Stone drones and I have had to contact customer support several times. They are there to help and your not on hold forever. They even replaced a drone that flew away from me and I couldn’t find it. I explained what happened and they were there to help. Outstanding.
",0.75715506156,electronics,"bought this a a beginner drone... was surprised that it paired up with phone very easily ! video from drone comes in very clear.. took a little getting used to going thru the steps to calibrate the drone before flight but after doing it a few times its really not that hard..... the remote is very straightforward ... those are the good parts.... but im having a big problem> at the last step of calibration the instructions say to move both joysticks downward and inward at the same time and the propellers rotate and the drone is unlocked... at this point the drone basiclly takes off wide open and flys away (not under my control) ive repeated the whole proccess of calibration man times and a few times when i get to the step of moving both joysticks in and down at the same time the rotors spin and the drone takes off to about 5 feet and hovers and seems to be under my control...... but more often than not it just flys away uncontrolably..... i gep practicing with it hoping its just user error but am really starting to believe this thing just has issues ! i really want for it to work properly!! its fun when it works properly but a real pain in the wallet when having to retrieve it from trees when it just flys away on its own...

Pairing with the phone is also easy. Liked the photo quality but the video quality was not up to the mark. The wide angle camera creates distortion in video which was really annoying. The package comes with 2 batteries and nice carrying backpack. Had a good experience so far.

However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.

",0.05782234757,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.08309632557,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.

Flight time will depend on multiple factors like temperature, wind speed, flight speed, video recording, altitude, GPS signal, distance from controller, and WiFi interference. While this is less than advertised, it is still very impressive for a drone of this size and price.—FLIGHT SPEED——————————The Mavic Mini can fly in three different modes depending on the pilot’s needs. The default mode (P), sport mode (S), or cinematic mode (C). The below shows how fast the drone travels in meters per second (m/s) depending on flight mode.•Max Speed (near sea level, no wind)13 m/s (S), 8 m/s (P), 4 m/s (C)•Max Ascent Speed4 m/s (S), 2 m/s (P), 1.5 m/s (C)•Max Descent Speed3 m/s (S), 1.8 m/s (P), 1 m/s (C)—PHONE APP——————————In order to fly this drone, you’ll want to download the new “DJI Fly” app from your App Store. This app will be how you see all of the drones status, outputs, camera feed, adjust settings, and update the firmware. This does enforce Geospatial Environment Online (GEO) restrictions on places DJI thinks you should not fly and will warn you or it’ll not let you take off or enter this air space. This app works side by side with the included controller and will require you to connect your phone/device to operate before your first flight.I recommend using an Apple iPhone for best results, however android phones are also supported. Before your first flight you are required to register and update the drone for the first time using the DJI app. Afterwards it’s optional and possible to operate the drone with only the included controller and not have a phone connected (not recommend). Remember if you do this you will not be able to see the camera, drone stats, or edit settings.It is HIGHLY recommended you also download the FAA (US) app “B4UFLY” in order to double check the air space you plan to enter does not have legal restrictions that DJI might not be aware of.—WEIGHT———————————While the drone does come in at 148/149 grams (including SD card) and does not require registration in the United States, be warned if you add ANYTHING to this drone (maybe even a sticker) you run the risk of breaking the law if it reaches 250 grams if it is not registered. Note, that if you use the propeller guards you will be way over the 250 gram weight limit!Also, I want to point out, DJI does make another battery for the Mavic Mini that weighs 50 grams less for Japan’s flight restrictions with 18 minutes (vs 30) of reported flight time. If you needed to cut weight, this would be the best option.—RETURN HOME——————————It’s important that if you plan to use this feature, you take off straight up and pause a few feet off the ground so the drone can capture the return home point.If the drone does disconnect from the controller/phone or the button is pressed, it will start the set Return To Home (RTH) procedure automatically. It’s also important to make sure the RTH Altitude is set above the highest structure around before you fly away. When the drone enters RTH, it will stay at is current altitude if already above your setting. If below your setting, it will gain the needed altitude for a safe return. Afterwards it will turn in your direction and fly straight back to the home point. Then, it will descend in altitude until landing. Note that this drone does not include collision avoidance sensors and it’s extremely important you set the minimum RTH altitude to avoid crashing.—BATTERY———————————DJI Mavic Mini battery’s are rated for 200 cycles. It is not recommended to continue use after 200 cycles.Dis/charge the battery to 40%-60% if it will not be used for 10 days or more, as it can greatly extend the battery life.Drone Battery Options:•[30] 2400 mAh (90 min recharge time)•[18] 1100 mAh (50 min recharge time)Controller Battery Option:•2600 mAh (120min recharge time)—OPERATIONS———————————You should not use the drone in severe weather conditions, strong wind, snow, rain, smog, hail, and lightning.Its recommend you only operate the drone in temperatures between 32° to 104℉. This is primarily due to battery issues that can arise with extreme temperatures.If the wind exceeds 18 mph you should land or not take off with this drone. With that said occasional wind gusts above this should not be an issue as long as you fly with caution. Remember that wind speed will usually increase with altitude.—SAFETY———————————While the drone is lightweight and may not damage/hurt “as much” with its small form factor compared to 250+ grams drone, it still brings risks and can cause serious injuries. Add to the fact that it offers ZERO collision avoidance sensors that DJI are well know for in the other Mavic models. The risk of collision is very likely if you are inexperience or not paying attention. If flying indoors, I would highly suggest you attach the propeller guards to avoid damage to your surroundings and the drone.—PRIACY—————————————This is a big topic nowadays and with DJI being based out of China it brings a red flag. Anyone getting this drone should be aware that DJI/China is watching! The app is chinaware and is collecting your information/data. Once collected this sits on China servers doing who knows what. Just be cautious of what you give this app access to.Next we have two other services all DJI drones support named “DRONE TO PHONE” and “AEROSCOPE”. In short, all DJI drones yell out your information for anyone who know how to read it over the air. I list more detail on both app’s below.Coming soon will be a public DJI “DRONE TO PHONE” app that will allow anyone within 1.5 miles to freely see your information including but not limited to the current drone & controller location, flight status, device serial numbers, drone altitude, and more... in real time from any smart phone while you fly your DJI drone. This to me brings risk of random people not only knowing all about your drone in the air but also where you the controller is operating from. Who knows what they will decide to do with this information... but I can’t think of many good reasons.On top of this they already market/sell a larger scale version of this called “AEROSCOPE” that allows the same information to be viewed when within 30 miles. I do like the idea of this a lot more, as it’s not in public hands. This version can be pricey and more for airport/no fly zone safety.With all that being said, I would like to end this section saying that DJI is one of the top drone companies in the world, but I felt a warning was definitely worth mentioning.—US/FAA LAWS——————————The following apply to ANYONE operating ANY unmanned aircraft as a hobbyist:-Only fly for recreational purposes-Only fly within visual line of sight-Never fly 400ft+ above ground/structure-Never fly in a restricted zone (B4UFLY)-Never fly above events/groups of people-Never fly near emergency responses-Never fly near manned aircrafts-Register if drone is 250 grams or moreThat last one is key because of how this drone is marketed. If you add ANYTHING to the Mavic Mini (including propeller guards), you will be over 149 grams and be breaking the drone takeoff weight limit without registration.
",0.558,electronics,"This drone requires the new DJI Fly app.  This is different from DJI Go.  The android version of the app is only certified for a handful of newer android devices.  (Even though it states 6.0 and higher) Make sure you check the DJI website for compatible devices before purchasing.  I was unable to install it both a Galaxy Note 4 (andriod 6.0) or a newer Galaxy Tab A (Android 8.0).  Fortunately, I was able to install it on my wife's iphone 7, but feeling pretty frustrated this is to market without a ready android app.  Edit:  It appears that DJI Fly is exclusively designed for 64 bit devices -- both android and ios.  Make sure your device is 64bit.  I had to purchase a new 8"" Samsung Galaxy tab with the 64bit snapdragon processor and was able to install the program on it.  Why DJI decided to couple the lowest tech drone they have designed with the highest tech operating system is a mystery.
",0.558,electronics,"The product is very good and flies excellent indoors. Now when you want to take it flying outside please first verify where you live with DJI's geo System to avoid not being able to fly your drone. Below is a summary of information I gathered from a Mavic mini forum:- DJI uses a Geo System that ""locks"" you out from flying in restricted zones.- Normally, you can ""self unlock"" or ""custom unlock"" a blue ""Authorization Zone"" at Fly Safe- This functionality is not yet available with the Mavic Mini. Estimated firmware release is ""late December"".In other words, any authorization requests for a ""blue"" zone will be denied until they update the aircraft's firmware in ""late December.""So please have this in mind when purchasing this product or if you prefer to be a beta tester for DJI go ahead. I think this is completely unacceptable. DJI please for future, release mature tested products to the market. Or otherwise on next new release it will be wise to at least wait 6 months until all firmware updates are also released to avoid this serious headache.
",0.18127185158,electronics," I built a quad several years ago.  It was very difficult to fly and had no camera, gimbal, etc...  I've heard a lot about DJI over the years, so I decided to try the Mavic Mini with the $400 price (this was double what the parts cost me for my first drone!)  My phone didn't support the DJI Play app, so after BUYING A NEWER PHONE I was able to fly the Mavic Mini.  I am blown away! Stable, smooth, I am VERY happy with my purchase.  Video is clear, sharp, and excellent frame rate. More than enough for personal use, or even YouTube videos.

",0.80745410958,electronics,"DJI products don't have rough edges - they have very intentionally placed jagged bits at regularly-spaced intervals.  If you're comfortable with their usual host of deficiencies and outright user-hostility, this product won't surprise you.  Like usual, it will refuse to even take off until you've jumped through a number of hoops in the app, including giving permission for your personal information and location to be broadcast to China.Unlike similar and previous products, this basic package does not include a battery charger.  The only way to charge a battery is to insert it into the drone, then charge the drone via USB.  If you want to charge a battery separately (while flying, for example), there's a $60 accessory you can't use because it's out of stock everywhere.The actual camera specs are approximately iPhone 3G quality, though the color accuracy isn't quite as good.  While it does include a token form of exposure adjustment, the fact that the remote is missing essentially all of its buttons makes it kind of a pointless feature.  We're missing the ability to shoot 4K or any kind of high framerate video, and the Mini also lacks basic drone features like subject tracking and flight path support.In terms of flying, the remote is the same fiddly one they've been shipping for awhile now, with no effort made to improve its godawful phone mounting system, but with all of the more useful buttons and wheels removed, as well as the screen.  The joysticks are technically removable, but fiddly to do so.  Additionally there is no way to disable auto-landing, making it hazardous to land on anything but perfectly flat, open ground, and nearly impossible to hand-retrieve safely.  Which is ironic, since they heavily advertised that as a feature of the Spark.If you absolutely NEED a drone this size with these capabilities, there are no alternatives.  It can be a game-changer the way the original Mavic was in terms of portability.  You just have to be comfortable with eternally shoddy firmware, broken apps, sketchy flight characteristics, and having your personal information hoovered up by the Xi regime.
",0.02194702658,electronics,"Works great with Samsung phone; what Android tablets work with DJI Fly software?
",0.77748745758,electronics,"you do realize that the majority of 2 year old mid level smart phones will NOT run there special ""DjiFly"" software. So you are stuck with a brick unless you want to buy a new phone that costs MORE than the drone!  So unless you have the lattest Iphone you may want to think twice about buying this drone.  I have to now return mine.  Worst part is my phone will fly all of DJI's top end model drones with the ""DJI GO"" app, but the Mini's specific app ""DJI FLY"" will only install on expensive brand new phones. Dont make the mistake i have and avoid this specific drone unless you have a expensive cell phone already.  Also DJI has no plans to update the app to work on 32bit systems (dont think just because your phone is android os 6.0 or greater it will work...i WONT).

",0.560,electronics,"I have a much better security camera system for my home's exterior but thought I might try one of these cams indoors since I have the Ring alarm system and a Ring Doorbell already.  I made the silly mistake, I guess, of assuming there would be some kind of integration with other Ring products - there isn't.  None.  Not a single thing.It seems like common sense to me that they'd integrate in a couple of ways.  I assumed that I'd be able to tell these cameras to only sense motion if the alarm was armed.  Nope.I figured I could at least set it to detect motion when I wasn't in the house.  Nope.  There isn't even any kind of proximity setting for it to even know if you're home or not.  They are not location aware in any way.  The Ring alarm system isn't either, so I suppose I should have known better already.I also assumed that if my Ring alarm went off the cameras would automatically come on and start recording.  Nope!The only motion option at all is to not alert you to motion during specific hours.  Note, this doesn't stop motion detection during these hours, it only stops the alerts.Motion detection/recording is only an on or off thing... absolutely no options whatsoever.Annoyed by the lack of integration I still mounted the camera in my great room.  I figured I try it for a few days and see how long the battery would actually last with motion recording on.  This is a high traffic area so I wasn't holding my breath... and sure enough, after not even 1 full day the battery is down to 80%.  This is with all the 'battery saving options' on.  This was only a test as I don't actually want recording of any kind going on in my house while I'm home unless the alarm is armed or going off.With absolutely no options, no integration with Ring alarm and no settings to limit it's recording this thing is really only good for one thing; on demand video with no automatic recording.  So, the thing is turned off now, doing nothing.  I can still activate it from my phone to occasionally check my house isn't burning down.Hopefully someday Ring will update the software and provide some common sense integration with it's other devices.This is all a shame as the build of the camera is quite good considering the low price as is the video quality.  The audio isn't great but it never is on cameras of any kind.***UPDATE***Ring support reached out to me directly almost immediately after I posted my review (Good on them) and told me how to link the Alarm, somewhat, to the camera.  You have to go into your Base Station settings, then linked devices, then you can set the cameras to record when the alarm goes off - but only then.  Make sure you have the updated app that just came out to do this. I didn't.  Again, the setting is in your base station, not in the cameras.This solved probably the biggest issue I had with the camera.  The rest of my review is still accurate though per Ring support.  Hopefully they'll add the other much needed features in the near future.***ANOTHER UPDATE***From Ring Support: ""The Modes feature will be released in November and will allow you to have the option to record motion only if the Ring Alarm System is set to Away Mode"".  This will be a great update and should have been available on launch.  I wonder if they are only just now thinking of it from all the negative feedback and reviews, but glad it's 'coming soon' either way.***ONE LAST UPDATE***Ring provided me early access to the 'Modes Feature' and I've been using it for the past few days.  It resolves all the issues I had with the alarm integration.  With modes you can set your cameras to only record when your alarm is set.  They can all be set independently and act differently depending on if you have your alarm set to off, home, or away.  For instance, you can set your exterior cameras to record when your alarm is set to home mode, but have your interior cameras are turned off.  You can set your interior cameras to only record while in away mode, etc. etc.  Or any combination.  The cameras can now be set the same way motion and door sensors can.  This is a great improvement.  They haven't told me exactly when this feature will be made public but have said it will be released 'by the end of the year'.I've increased the rating from 3 stars to 5.  This software update really has resolved every issue I had with the cameras.  I've now ordered and installed an additional 6 for my home.
",0.12626469160,electronics,"Camera performs as expected and works fine. I took away stars since this camera does not integrate with the ring alarm system. Currently there is NO WAY to get motion alerts or record motion ONLY when no one is home. You can schedule times but schedules change often. I don't need an alert and recording every. single. time. I enter a room...Idea that tons of people on the web are asking for: Have an option to record motion only if the ring alarm system is set to away mode! If this were available I would easily give 5 stars. If I had known about this issue I would not have bought the ring alarm system or the ring cam. I assumed a top tier company deeply invested in home automation would be on top of this.
",0.85060751460,electronics,"Recently, I wrote a rather scathing 1 star review about the problems I was having with my new Ring Stick Up Wireless Battery Cam. I'm no stranger to wireless cams, having 10 hooked up and running seamlessly on another network as I write this, but I was totally frustrated with the connection reliability, not only with my two upper end cellphones, but also on my Galaxy Tab and Amazon Show. More times than not, the software wouldn't connect with the camera but when it did, the video was choppy. Notifications were also hit and miss. I have a great wireless mesh router system throughout the house, so after doing all the troubleshooting I could think of, I assumed it was due to faulty hardware or software. I gave up and started the return process through Amazon. It was a new product after all and new products sometimes are really buggy. Plus, I read other negative reviews which seemed to justify my thoughts and actions.Then I got an email from a gentleman from Ring saying he read my review and asked if I'd be willing to let him help troubleshoot my issues with me. Although I had already started the return process, I was willing. It was refreshing to know Ring Customer Service was genuinely interested in troubleshooting possible defects in their newest product.Together, we isolated the issue within about 20 minutes. It turned out it wasn't the camera or software after all.Anyone having connection issues should do what he advised me to do. Open up the Ring app and click on the 3 little dots to the upper right of the camera screenshot, then select settings. From there go to Device Health and check the signal strength. Although I had a good mesh hub (inside) within 10 feet of my camera (mounted outside), my signal strength was RSSI -64. He stated that the signal was so weak it was on the cusp of what is needed for the camera to even minimally operate. This prompted me to reboot my wireless mesh system and reset/reconnect the camera. When it came back online, my signal strength went to -39, a vast improvement.A quick check of all of my devices showed the camera and software working flawlessly. Hat's off to Ring.Anyone who may be having connection or audio/video/notification difficulties, check your signal strength to the camera via the Ring software, even if your router is close by. You just might be surprised.***UPDATE***Camera (and software) is still working flawlessly on all devices.Yesterday, Ring updated their Windows 10 desktop app (which previously didn't work with the new battery cams) and it works flawlessly as well.Observations.Notifications on my phone, Tab and Amazon devices (Show, Echo, Dot) are almost instantaneous. Alexa says ""Someone is at your front door."" Very cool.I bought an extra battery, but it looks like it'll be at least a month before I need to swap it out, even with the intensive testing I've done on the Stick Up Cam. Battery life seems excellent.I have one zone blocked out and that seems to work fine as well. I also have it mounted a couple of feet above and to the left of my front door, tilting downward at an angle. Even though residential traffic is visible in the field of view, I've not gotten one trigger due to street activity. The motion sensor is triggered by anything coming into the bottom half of it's field of view. From the time someone triggers the motion sensor until the time I'm aware of it is 1-2 seconds. That's about as close to real time as you can get. It's not given me a false alarm even once.Telling my Amazon Show to ""(Alexa), show front door cam"" takes about 5 seconds to complete.I can also watch triggered video clips and get a live feed while away from home without any extra setup to my network. It's totally automatic.Because of the customer service I received from Ring and the fact the product is much better than I originally thought, I will be expanding my Ring family soon.
",0.17982742260,electronics,"I rarely write reviews. I was really excited about this product so I ordered two. Just got them today and spent 3 calls with support and they don’t work as intended. I had a breaking on my property two weeks ago. Support tried to help with both and unfortunately hours later nothing. The issue for me is that the notifications barely work. It’s a hit and miss if they do. What’s the point if your devices do not get dependable motion notifications? Customer service was nice but unable to help at this point. I had been burglarized two weeks ago and was expecting that this would be great.This is my second review. I have to wait for an appointment next week after an email I received today. I didn’t go into full length yesterday because I was upset. First they told me my first device was defective and to open the second one and that I would get a replacement for the first after a hold of 1 dollar on my card. I wanted to test it looking out my living room window. I’ve had no alerts since at all. My neighbors kids came by and knocked on my door and nothing. If you want to watch a live camera all day and night this is for you. We come and go and I pay ADT to monitor my house. I’m angry because I lost a lot of tools and if this doesn’t do motion alerts whether home or not just find something else.
",0.01066330160,electronics,"Updated review after 24 hours post-installation:I have to say, I am extremely disappointed with Ring’s new release. I pre-ordered this camera primarily due to the price and I now see why this model is $70 cheaper than the Gen 2 at regular price.To start, mounting hardware is no longer included. Amazon is now selling a separate kit for mounting (security screws and screwdriver) for $20. To be fair, I feel like if someone is installing these cameras in their home, it’s a good saving to pass on to them.However, my biggest issue is the build of the Gen 3. Once you plug it in and run through the setup, you can tell that it is inferior to the Gen 2. The field of view in this new camera is a lot smaller as follows:Gen 3 Stick Up Cam (this model) field of view110° horizontal, 57° verticalVersusGen 2 Stick Up Cam Wired field of view150° horizontal, 85° verticalTherefore, you have less coverage (e.g. if you are trying to see a big back yard) and require multiple cameras. The Gen 2 covered my entire back yard with its near fisheye view. I would require two of these cameras to provide equal coverage.Motion zones is no longer editable like it was in the previous model. The motion zones is similar to that of the first Gen Ring Doorbell. It is a semi-circle from the bottom of the screen and you can only make the circle bigger (extending motion zone) or smaller (shrinking motion zone). The top half of the screen is completely exposed and cannot be used to detect motion. The Gen 2 allowed me to have different motion zones and allowed me to customized the zones to cover anywhere on the screen I saw fit. This is important as I do not want my patio to be within the motion detection zone since we are relaxing out there quite often.My issue with the lack of POE as stated in my quick review below stands.Lastly, the quality of the image, while it is claimed to be 1080p appears to be less of that my Gen 2 with POE. It’s possible that the WiFi signal can be blamed (there is a noticeable lag during live view that I contribute to the WiFi),  but the location of my camera is directly beneath my router (~3-5 feet away) therefore cannot be blamed for everything. I have up to 400 mb/s down and 25 mb/s up consistently.I wish these specs were easily available when the pre-order page was still present. I probably would’ve ordered more Gen 2 than these new Gen 3 had I known. Cost cutting is great and always welcomed, but it should NEVER be at the expense of quality on a once excellent product. Naming this camera as part of the Stick Up line is extremely deceiving since it is so different. I would’ve rather they kept the build and cost the same as Gen 2 since they also released the budget Indoor cam as well.Original quick review post-unboxing:I pre-ordered this stick up cam PLUG-IN without the solar power option and received it today. I am extremely disappointed that Amazon/Ring removes the POE input and replaced it with some type of DC plug. I am extremely disappointed and wish I had purchased some more of the second Gen cameras!! Do not buy if you want to use POE.
",0.10872694860,electronics,"Had the camera up and running in less than ten minutes. Excellent quality picture. Hooking up to the solar panel when installing, this way battery is always charged. Received mounting hardware, camera has been installed.
",0.75112634960,electronics,"So the camera is okay if used outdoors. Read others reviews for why exactly indoor use is not great. The biggest disappointment when used outdoors is you cannot set specific motion notification zones like you can with the flood light cam or the other outdoor ring camera. All you can do is slide a sensitivity bar over a general area within the cameras field of view. Does it work...sure...but without zone control its not that great.
",0.78043222460,electronics,"It was easy to set up and is a great companion to my Ring doorbell on the front of the house. It has an excellent field of view and the image itself is very good.Now for the bad: it lost all WiFi connectivity overnight and I have a strong WiFi signal where the camera is located. When I set it up again, it downloaded updates again. This would seem to suggest there were new updates today, even though it grabbed updates when installed yesterday.I gave it three stars because I like what is potentially capable of, and I am realistic about a brand new product on day one. It may take a little time to work out all the bugs so patience is required for the first few months.I should also add that the support rep spoke very poor English and it really got to the point I just wanted to get her off the call. I probably understood about two out of three words from the representative. This was more disappointing to me than the actual failure, but she was able to help me get it resolved - with various request to repeat things.Update day 2: Camera has disconnected from network again, which means I have to go out and push the setup button again and reconnect it to the network. I don't really want to call their support number again because that was such a painful experience. I really want this to work so I am going to have to think about how much patience I have versus my frustration and desire to return it.End of day 2 update: after connecting to the network again this morning at 10:30, it had dropped off WiFi by my return at 5:00 pm. I also noted the battery is down to 75% after two days of “not working”. This is stretching even my patience.Despite the issues I have experienced with this device, I remain a fan of Ring products. I did receive a nice note from Ring customer support offering additional assistance, but he only works on weekdays so I cannot pursue the issue until next Monday. In defense of Ring, they were extremely helpful with my doorbell last spring so I have high confidence this will be resolved - if I can handle the shorter than expected battery life.Beginning of day 3: I placed the camera on my desk, about 3 feet from the wireless access point as a test to see if wifi signal strength is the culprit. Reconnected it to the WiFi network. Battery strength on this beginning of day 3 at 61%. Even if I get this working correctly, I don't believe the battery life will satisfy my expectations.End of day 3. Disconnected from WiFi after a few hours, sitting right beside access point. Discounts signal strength issue. I will work with with support next week to figure this out.FINAL UPDATE: After working with Ring support, they assessed the camera as faulty and had me return it for replacement. Sadly, the replacement worked exactly the same way. This suggests a problem on my network (even though two other Ring cameras are working fine) or a faulty batch of cameras. After working with Ring support again, they forwarded me to a second tier support rep. During our efforts, it stopped responding to the setup button so I was no longer able to work with  this camera. At this point we returned the unit. I was disappointed with the battery life and since they couldn't product a unit that would work on my network I decided it was time to fold. I remain a fan of Ring products in general, but this second example of the ""Stick up cam"" failed before we could do any extensive diagnostics so we will never really know what the problem was. (oh - for you networking folks out there, I did set the camera's mac address to a reserved IP address in my DHCP server. Worked fine for the usual 5ish hours and then lost the network again.)
",0.01703664760,electronics," I did four times of entry/exit front door testing. It ONLY worked once (video + notification). There were no people captured in two other videos, like I attached.  And it missed both video and notification on one testing.The video sync up was also slow. It took about 6 mins to show up the clip in the ring app.I really like the design and easy-installation. But the motion detection is the deal breaker. I have no choice but return it.
",0.19948583860,electronics,"UPDATE 11/15/19:  I've had the camera for two weeks and overall it has performed fine with respect to recording and in freezing weather. The only issue with it is the battery life, if you are planning on putting this camera outdoors GET THE SOLAR PANEL! I've had it up without one because I wanted to see how long the battery would last after being fully charged and for our normal usage. The settings I have it on are: Motion Detection: ON, Motion Frequency: STANDARD, Motion Verification: OFF. Video Settings: Live View - ON, Tap Camera Preview - OFF, Audio streaming/recording - ON, Infrared Lights for Night vision - ON. I also have it linked to the front doorbell so that when it detects motion it triggers the doorbell to begin recording. The traffic in front of the house is steady but not crazy, normal subdivision. With these settings and at the 15 day mark of being up the battery on this camera is currently reading less than 10%. It's a shame that the battery life is on the ""meh"" side, so you either need to have another battery pack as a back up on stand-by or use the solar panel.  I'll be adding a solar panel and will report back how it goes with another update.------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:Overall, I like the simplicity and ease of the Ring system. This is NOT the high-end camera so all you people expecting that at this price point need to get a reality check! READ THE SPECS before you order it, if it does not meet your situation spend the $ and get the high-end one. I already had doorbells (hardwired and battery) along with the security system prior to getting this outdoor camera. The set up was simple enough, just like their other products, it was easy to link it with the alarm base, and set up the motion detection. One feature it does have is the ability to link it with the other doorbell cameras and cameras that I have. For example, if the front doorbell detects motion I can have the camera begin recording and vice versa. You need to really look at the settings in the base unit (if you have the alarm system) to understand what options there are.The camera comes well-packaged and the instructions are very straightforward, the camera is small and very easy to put up. This being said, I do believe it is overpriced, it should be the same amount as the indoor corded camera that is around $59. I have my motion notification settings on ""standard"", we'll see how the battery life goes, will probably get a solar panel for it at some point. The picture quality is pretty clear and the adjustability to get the angles you want are very easy to do with the basic mount it comes with, the package includes all the hardware needed to install it. I would suggest you have someone hold up the camera where you want to mount it at and then look at your phone to see what the view actually looks like BEFORE you actually mount it. The night pic on the camera is decent, a bit better then the DoorbellPro that I have, gives me a nice wide view of the porch, the driveway, part of the street in front of the house, all the way across the street to driveways for those houses. This was a pleasant surprise for such a small camera. The motion detection is simple, it allows you to adjust a zone that you want monitored fairly easily within the app. You will need to charge the battery fully prior to use, the pack has two lights on it, one amber, the amber one will go out once the battery is fully charged. Everything you need to set the camera up with comes in the box. It is small, but solid, camera weight less than 1 lb. I replaced a bullet style that I had with it. The two-way sound works good as well, it picked up a conversation my neighbor was having on his porch and of people walking past the house on the sidewalk. I will probably be getting a couple of more of these, just wish that Ring would bring the prices down a bit. Overall, pretty nifty little camera that does what I need it to do without having to run a bunch of wires all over the place.
",0.80052250661,electronics,"I have to admit that I am a longtime fan of SONOS, although I do think that I have dealt my share of constructive criticism over the years. When it comes to the SONOS MOVE, I think they have made a home run!Here is what I like:1. It sounds amazing! Here's why - The bass is significant, even outside, without ever getting distorted. It plays really loud if you want, but also sounds well balanced at low sound levels. They did something amazing with the high-frequency and mid-range where is sounds uniform across the entire side and forward projection of the speaker, not just in the ""sweet spot"" in front like other speakers. It is beautifully detailed and realistic sounding.2. It looks great. Here's why - It has the same great looks as I have come to expect from SONOS, but there is something about the material choices on this product that make it even better. It fits right in with my other SONOS speakers, while not taking up any more space than say a SONOS ONE.3. Automatic Trueplay - it automatically adjusts its sound depending on where you place the speaker, making sure that it always sound its best. I imagine this was pretty had to do, but it works really well. I put MOVE in some pretty challenging places inside and outside, and within 20 or 30 seconds or so it just fixes itself and sounds great again!4. The WiFi range - I took MOVE outside and began to walk all around the outside my house and into the yard pretty far away and it never lost connection. SONOS did something special here with the WiFi to make it super robust.5. Bluetooth - even if you go some place without WiFi, you can still connect with Bluetooth. I like having that feature so that I don't have to worry if there is WiFi or not wherever I might travel.6. It feels solid - It has a great solid and balanced feeling to it. There is an integrated handle in the back that is just part of the design. I've set it down on sand and grass and it just feels stable and balanced.7. Stereo pair - I only have one, and with it I can fill my whole yard with incredible sound, but I like knowing that if I ever got another one, I could set them up as a stereo pair and have myself a real outdoor concert!8. It's weather proof - you could get caught in the rain, or it could get dirty and you can just rinse it off with a hose. I plan to take good care of MOVE, but its nice to know that it has this level of protection from the elements.9. It has voice control - just like the SONOS ONE, it has a microphones that allow you to use Alexa and Google voice assistants. That comes in handy, especially when you are outside grilling.10. Charging base - it comes with a nice charging base, instead of it being sold as an accessory like other brands do.What I don't like:1. Travel bag - it comes with a nice looking bag, but I question how long it will last and how much protection it will really give. I'm sure SONOS will offer a travel bag accessory at some point, but for $400, it seems like they could have included a nylon padded bag with handle and pouch for accessories.2. USB-C charger - it is great that it comes with a nice charging base, but if they made the charger a detachable USB-C charger, then you could more easily take it with you when you travel. I'm sure SONOS will probably sell a USB-C charger accessory at some point, but again, for $400, I think this could have been included.Overall, this is one fantastic product. I would say that this is easily the best SONOS product they have ever made. I just love having a"" truly wireless"" wireless speaker!
",0.96368682461,electronics,"Finally, at long last.....we finally have an outdoor, portable, Bluetooth/wifi Sonos speaker offering. I have Sonos products all over my house, so I will admit I already like their products and I am very familiar with them. This speaker fits perfectly into their lineup for people who want to be able to bring Sonos away from home wifi zones. I'll make this review short and sweet. This speaker is not small....it's probably about twice the volume of a Play One. It's also not light, but it comes with a very well-designed handle. The way I think of this speaker is a new and improved Play 3 that happens to be mobile and battery operated. It has a front-facing driver that sounds very nice and is plenty loud for my taste. It can be paired to another Move speaker if you have a large deck and you don't want to hardwire a stereo setup.What I do with mine is the perfect application, in my opinion. I leave the handy and well-executed charging station where I would have placed a Play 3 in my house. It will operate exactly the same as your other Sonos speaker. When I'm going to use it outside, I simply pick it up and take it with me. The internal wifi extenders means I never have to use Bluetooth when I'm anywhere near my house. I use this on my deck. If I forget to bring it in at night, it will have no issues with a rain storm, a drop into the pool, or a water gun blast.Pros:- Solid speaker loudness and tone. It's not as good as a Play 5, but as good or slightly better than the Play One.- Very well built.- Charging station is nicely done and can remain in a convenient location.- Can be charged with any USB-C plug as well.- 10 hour battery life at 50% volume.Cons:- Price. This is not an inexpensive speaker.- Size and weight. I don't take this to the beach with me. It's a little too big for that and I wouldn't want to risk something of this value at the beach.- It's new, so there are not any aftermarket wall or deck mounts being made yet. I am waiting for a wall-mount for my deck where I can just set it down out of the way.

This really is an amazing speaker.  If you own a Sonos system it's a great adjunct.  I now have 19 Zones with my new ""Move"" speakers including three Zones in my yard.  The ""Move"" is the speaker I've been hoping that Sonos would make.  Every situation is different but I'd highly recommend getting a pair of them.  Everything sounds better in stereo.  Enjoy and thanks Sonos for making life just a little bit better.
",0.99146437661,electronics,"My old bluetooth speaker blew out, so I decided to upgrade to the Sonos Move. Obviously, it’s pricey. But with that price comes a sound quality I didn’t expect from a portable speaker. Audio is rich and clear. Bass is deep enough, but noticeable better in smaller quarters.The build quality is what you’d expect for the price. The charging ring-type stand is a nice touch. And speaking of touch, the touch controls on the top of the unit are responsive with a light tap.When it comes to portability, it fell like carrying a gallon of water around. Carry this around in a backpack and be ready to sweat. It does come with a soft felt fabric bag which is only good for keeping dust and debris off the unit. If you plan on taking it places, get a case.The Sonos Move is a solid buy if you want to splurge.
",0.89892464961,electronics,"I have only had this speaker for several days now, but have been so impressed with it I couldn't wait to write a review. The first night I had it, I took it to a bar where we were sitting outside, this thing sounded so good it was attracting positive attention from every one within earshot. I only use it as a Bluetooth speaker, so I cannot attest to it's Wi-Fi, or AI assistant capabilities. It will not work right out of the box and must be set-up through the Sonos app which is not a big deal and the app works very well. Someone wrote in another review that you can adjust the bass and treble through the app, but I did not see it and I looked everywhere. That being said, the speaker sounded perfectly balanced without making any adjustments! Bluetooth connectivity works great and my iPod synced with it immediately. It comes with a bag that looks great and should do just fine to provide some protection against scratches. The build quality is great, this thing is built like a tank! The charging base works every time, even if the speaker is not perfectly placed. I cannot say enough about how good this speaker sounds!! If there was anything that I could say about it that I don't like, it would be all the funny noises it makes when you touch any of the buttons. I really don't need to hear sounds confirming that I am adjusting the volume up or down.
",0.22701257561,electronics,"I’m a veteran SONOS owner and user, with multiple Play3, CONNECT Amps and now MOVE. The MOVE adds much needed weatherproof portability to the SONOS lineup while retaining the impressive audio quality that SONOS is known for.  This speaker sounds as good or better than most Bluetooth portables, while enabling WiFi connectivity to SONOS when in range. It’s a bit large and heavy for a portable, but makes up for it in durability and function. Very easy to move and keep charged. I bought one immediately, because I enjoy having music nearby when I perform outdoor tasks and love the streaming options available through SONOS – so washing the car, working on the tractor, or reading outside on the deck all became more enjoyable. It works just like any other SONOS component and is easy to set up once you have the App and music services enabled. I also appreciate that SONOS has diligently worked to improve performance, streaming quality and connectivity over time – much more reliable now than it was several years ago and adding components today is almost seamless. If you already have SONOS this is a terrific addition, if not it will be a great first SONOS component. It’s not cheap, it would be a great value at $250 but at $399 it’s definitely an investment.
",0.98963540861,electronics,"First off, I've only had the speaker for 24 hours, so my experience is limited. I'm currently on vacation with family at a house in Maine and ordered this to have some tunes. I've had several family members already ask about it and shown interest.

",0.97393083663,electronics,no review,0.62447536364,electronics,"UPDATE OCT 29It's definitely not working consistently. Recently we went on vacation and I could not find my keys. Turns out they were right in my purse  which I was holding in my hand. When I opened the app which had been running in the background and pressed to find my keys, it said that I was out of range. I was certainly not out of range, it was only inches away. I was freaking out thinking I threw my keys in the trash when I finally found them in a zippered compartment. They never rang! I am not sure why I even keep this on my keys. Total waste!ORIGINAL REVIEWI was excited to try these Tiles with the app, to have a way to find our keys etc. I downloaded the app to my iPhone and found that the set up was rather easy, and at first everything went great.Then I let it sit for a minute and went to the app to find the keys which were sitting right beside me, and the tile app said that they were not in range. Ok that is disturbing. After looking around the app for awhile it just randomly started working again. I do not have any issues with any other things that connect via bluetooth so I found this odd.I tried downloading the app on my iPad to see if it could find my phone and I got an error message that said unexpected error when trying to call the phone. I was assuming it was going to send the same tone to my phone that it would send if I double pressed the tile button. It seemed to indicate it was trying to call my phone, but I am not sure how it could do that since I never gave it my phone number.I ended up deleting the app from my iPad in case having it on two devices was confusing it. There is a thing where you can send a link to your PC and that did not work either. I can not find a place to enter my phone number. I tried deleting and reinstalling the app and the find my phone thing just does not work except when I press the tile button twice on the actual tile.That brings me to another error. When I was sitting here I double pressed the tile button and it did not ring my phone. I checked the app and it was running in the background but it gave me another tone that seemed to indicate that it could not find my phone. After opening the app and then trying again it did work.I feel skeptical that this thing will really be a lifeline if I actually lose something. It seems to work half the time and the other half of the time it does not. It also in one place said I had two tiles in my account and I only set up one of the tiles so I am not sure what is up with that. I am planning to set up the other tile with my husbands phone and keys, so I never set it up yet. Maybe the tiles are paired already because they know they came from the same box.One other thing. Considering the price of these, and that they work via my bluetooth, I am not sure why every time I press a button in the app I keep getting urged to sign up for tile premium? I could see if the tiles were only like $5 each, but I think that these new ones are at least $50 for two of them. For that price I should not be prompted at every turn with an ad for Tile Premium.As for the range. It says up to 400 ft. So I put the keys in the middle of my house and walked out to the mailbox by the street, and it said that the tile was out of range. My lot is maybe 180ft deep and our backyard is way longer than our front so I am guessing that I was maybe 80-90 feet. Perhaps that is only if your keys are in an open area with no walls. Anyway I would not assume that 400 ft applies, unless maybe you are out in an open field.I'm really disappointed in these. I definitely do not think these are worth the price tag. To me for something designed to work to find something lost which is a stressful situation, these are just not consistently reliable. If I do lose my keys I will not know if it says they are out of range because they are out of range or if the thing is just malfunctioning.Thanks for reading my reviewBecky Brooks

",0.24352452264,electronics,"After my keys went missing last week, I bought a Tile Pro and attached it to my new set.  I found that getting it to activate from my phone was a little inconsistent within my apartment, but I trusted that it would get the job done should my keys ever become lost at home.Two days later, I wake up to find that the tile is no longer attached to my keychain.  The app tells me that it was last seen 8 hours ago near the vicinity of where I had been out the night before.  I set the tile to ""lost"" and went searching its last known whereabouts without any luck.  I ride a bicycle, so I figure if it fell off while on the road, traffic probably destroyed it.I'm not sure how the tile came loose.  The rest of my keyring is intact and no other keys are missing.  Maybe it'll turn up and I'll be able to figure it out.  I don't see myself purchasing one of these again, though.  For the price, I could make several sets of spare keys to tuck away in my bag and at home.  I feel a bit foolish for not having done so instead of purchasing a Tile in the first place.For most users, I'd suggest that preemptively copying your keys is cheap and presents a sure-fire solution to lost keys, while purchasing a Tile only gives you a shot at recovery.  I wouldn't recommend a bluetooth tracker unless your keys can't be copied cheaply.

From there it paired seamlessly to my new Tile. My husband's on the other hand, was a headache to set up. His phone kept searching for the Tile even after all the instructions were followed so I ended up having to log out of my account on my phone, log into his and pair the Tile that way which worked only that when I went to log out and see if it worked on his phone it showed his Tile as lost.

But so far, it seems to be a very competent device. The colors are sharp and crisp, the resolution is amazing and it's everything I've come to expect from Ring.The camera is a fixed position camera (no pan/tilt feature), but it does have a wide viewing angle. The images you see are as clean and distinct on the far edges as they are in the center of the picture/video. It really is a nice view.The only reservation I have with this camera is Amazon and Ring's willingness to use our cameras for law enforcement. Mind you, I'm not breaking any laws, but at the same time I'm not willing to give any company the ability to view my private life with or without my consent. As far as I know, neither company is using the data from my cameras for their own reasons, but I'm still suspect of their intent.However, despite my tin-foil hat and conspiracy theories, I'm loving my Ring camera. It has two-way communication and an alarm to scare my dogs when they fall asleep on the couch. Bad dog! Get off the couch and don't bark at me, you silly puppy! I digress, it's a fantastic device and for the price ($60 at the time of this review), it's everything we expect from Ring. Five stars.
",0.89410299165,electronics,"I am very disappointed in the functionality of this product.Having indoor security is a great thing but I do not wanna have to give up all of my privacy to get it. There are plenty of reasons why a person may not want to be recorded inside their home. Currently, you have no options for turning off the cameras from the app.After more than half an hour on the phone with customer support, they made it clear that there was no option for privacy except for physically unplugging the cameras.  This is extremely impractical. My cameras, for instants, are mounted up at the ceiling and need a ladder to access.  I'm sure that I do not need to give you examples of all the reasons that this would be problematic, since I can think of a half dozen off the top of my head.Another possible partial solution would be restricting what information shared users can see. Currently there don't seem to be any options at all about how much someone can see if you share your account with them. If they were option settings for sharing, I could decide how much they see.  But there aren't.I am still deciding if I will be keeping these new cameras or not.
",0.75136339765,electronics,"Pros:CostDaylight videoEasy SetupCons:Hardware that comes with it will not mount into studs (screws too shallow).Power cord is a proprietary micro USB (plug recessed deep on the camera) so unable to use just any micro-usb plug.Night video has issues keeping everything in focus (blurry top of the screen)First and foremost, its a 60 dollar camera.  The least expensive camera Ring has produced.  I have the Doorbell Pro, and the floodlight camera watching the front and back of my house, so was excited to see a cheaper option to put one in my garage.The camera itself is incredibly small, almost the size of the ring doorbell itself.  Setting it up was a breeze if you already have a Ring device.  Took me 15 minutes to get the camera up and running and added to my existing Ring app.The video quality is on par with the other devices in the daylight.  No complaints about that.  The night vision however,  seems like it has some issues.  I've noticed that anything on the top of the screen comes off blurry and out of focus in night vision.  I haven't experienced that with other ring cameras, and may be due to mounting the camera high on the wall and it having an issue keeping everything in focus.  I know they increased the viewing angles on this model, so it may also have to do with that.  Its purely speculation, but it is a 60 dollar camera, so not a deal breaker for me.  Its not like Spiderman will be breaking into my garage.The biggest negative on this device however (and why I took away a star) is the hardware.  The mounting screws are far too shallow to get through drywall and into a stud.  So they include the anchors for drywall, and you will need to mount this into the anchors.  This seems like a huge miss considering most Ring devices account for this and always have included the appropriate hardware.The other negative is the power cord.  Six foot is hardly enough to work with.  With the camera being powered with a micro-usb, if you're thinking ""well just buy a longer usb cord"", that won't work.  The plug in on the back of the camera is far too recessed for anything other than the cord that it comes with.  So unless you're looking to use a typical 120 extension cable, make sure you're planning on mounting this close to the outlet.

The agent didn’t even read it and wasted my time asking questions that were already answered.The support chat took over 20 minutes with long delays between responses and the agent was still not able to confirm shipment of a replacement. It was as if the agent was working several calls and not focused on my chat.Defective product plus poor customer service is a recipe to loose loyal customers.  I was an early adopter of Ring and have many of their products. This experience has given me pause when considering them in the future or recommending Ring to others.
",0.76541674165,electronics,"Very easy setup, great image quality (light or dark), great audio quality, nice form-factor, perfect integration with my Ring network.INSTALL:This took about 4 minutes to set-up. That includes opening the box and updating my Ring app. Amazing! This is my 3rd Ring camera (first of this type), and I also have 3 other d-link cameras and 15+ other network-connected smart home devices and this one had been the easiest to set-up, by far! Most have required at least one call to CustSvc at some point in the process (& I'm very familiar with IOT and network installs). I didn't need any of that knowledge with this new Ring device. I'd recommend you install/update your Ring app first, as that was my only hiccup (old versions dont have the new hardware listed).APP:So: install/update Ring app > Open box > remove and unwrap device & plug (usb to 2-prong usb) > plug in to outlet > in the app, tap add device (or devices > add...) > Quick scan of barcode w/phone camera > and viola! you're off to play with some settings and have more convenience/security/peace of mind in your life!In the app, you can adjust motion zones, notification sound/volume, link to other devices, snooze motion, and other functions, as with the other Ring cameras.MOUNT:It can be mounted on a flat shelf surface, on the wall, or on the ceiling. Wall anchors and screws are included. And w/your own philips head screwdriver, the base moves to the back for wall mounting. The base also articulates quite a bit, maintaining stability, and holding its position well. It seems very well thought-out in that regard.USE:I'm using this in an unconventional way. My laundry room isn't easy to get to, so I have the cam pointed at my machines in the hopes of being able to check on loads before stopping what I'm doing and making the trek to a mid-cycle load. (Or for a quick chat with hubby if he's in there). I also plan to position it to capture other utilities, to check on any alarms that might be triggered (fire, smoke, flood...). Here's hoping i never need it for that. (pics to show light & dark quality; no editing or filters. I know I gotta clean up in there 😄)I rely on reviews to help me make informed decisions. I hope this review helped you :)
",0.97290611365,electronics,"I needed a cam to see the inside of the house when we are out. Decided to give this one a try since it was meant to be indoors.Pros:- smaller profile (I placed this cam next to the Ring Stickup Battery Cam, and an 8oz bottle of water for comparison)- easy setup (took a total of 2 minutes to get up and running)- two way audio had a delay, but still less than my Arlo cams.Cons:- initial lag. At least on my device, there seems to be about 2 seconds worth of feed that is “fastforwarded” before the stream stabilizes. Not a deal breaker, but the other ring cams I have do not do this.Overall, great product that fulfills a niche purpose. Cheap alternative if you need specifically, an economical indoor cam.
",0.565,electronics,"I really like the size of the indoor cam compared to the stickup cam wired (Gen 2). It is noticeably smaller in size and looks better when used inside. Overall the picture quality is nice, sound works well (I am able to control an Alexa Show through the camera), and it captured motion events reliably.Comparing to the stickup cam wired, there are a few things to note. The stickup cam shows color video in lower light before switching to IR night vision as compared to the indoor cam. Also, the indoor cam has a narrower field of view, but to be honest, I likely only noticed because I did a side by side comparison of them; without seeing them sitting next to each out, I doubt you would notice, but it is a difference.  I didn't find anything the indoor cam did better except for physical looks, however, is it a fraction of the cost of the stickup cam wired (soon to be re-released as stickup cam elite). If you are in the market for an indoor camera, I would strongly recommend looking at this one unless you need POE, in which case the Stickup Cam Elite (or Gen 2 Wired) is the better choice.
",0.87046951165,electronics,"I think it's best for this cam placement if you put it with a crowded counter or shelf to not be as noticeable as a recording camera. Once set,  it hides well.I already have 2 doorbells and 3 chimes and an outdoor cam with siren and security lights.I have another type of indoor cameras, the WYZE cams ... you can see my review on that in my reviews section ... they are not reliable at all. They are very hard to use when away from home .. can't share the videos from the phone. One even just stopped working!! Low priced,  and in this case,  you get what you pay for!This new indoor cam was easy as heck to set up and connect to the app to go right with my other cams. The view is amazing! The picture quality and sound is the best! Yes,  you'll pay more,  but do it! It's worth it.None of the RING products have EVER let me down,  close to home or away!
",0.8214613266,electronics,"I am so happy with this smart watch. I have been wanting a smart watch but haven’t wanted to spend the money. This watch is amazing.Setting the watch up was simple. Once you download the app to your phone it walks you thru everythingThe battery life is loooooonnnnngggggggg. I have worn this watch for over a week already and still do not need to recharge itThis watch does show how many steps I’ve taken, and it also shows miles walked for day and calories burned. It also rolls up your week. For details longer than a week out, just go to the app on your phone and you can see the historyIt is set to take my heart rate continuously. I’m given a notification when i hit my goal of steps and miles. I can set the watch by type of activity I’m doing (run, bike, hike, elliptical and so on).The watch is able to control the music volume on my phone. I have set the watch to give notifications when i have an incoming call. I can read all my text messages on the watch. I can read my WhatsApp messages on the watch as well as any Facebook notificationI am able to set up email notifications but i have not done so due to the enormous amount of emails i get (work) and my wrist would be vibrating all day long.The watch does show me how i slept (YIKES...now i fully understand why I’m so tired all the time). It tells you how long you were in a deep sleep versus light sleep versus awake.I am able to control the brightness of the screen and the watch does give you options of several different watch faces.I highly recommend this watch
",0.28978887266,electronics,"I received this health tracker smart watch on October 21st, charged it up and I've been wearing it since. It's now November 9th and my watch still has 23% battery left so needless to say the battery life is exceptional.I have a particular need to track my heart rate so this is perfect for that. The alarm feature is very handy as well. I've never taken it off to shower or wash my hands or wash dishes and have experienced no problems at all.It's easy to read and you can choose from several different ""faces"" so you can probably find one that works for you.The only problem I had (it's not really a problem for me because I don't really use the function) is that the sleep tracker wasn't completely accurate. That's definitely not a deal breaker for me.Overall I'm quite pleased with my purchase.

It holds a charge for more than what is needed for a full day and the included charger is simple to attach and USB so lots of options for charging points. Overall great Smart watch to track anything you would want to, the app it links to also allows you to set goals which is amazing. I highly recommend this product
",0.94064772166,electronics,"Sleek, modern, elegant. My brother actually asked me how I was liking my Apple Watch, lol, that’s how great it looks!The sleep tracking is extremely accurate from what I can tell. It shows a report with the time I fell asleep and the time I woke up in the morning, and it actually matches the time  I wake up in the mornings. I’m not sure the calories are very accurate because there are days I do an hour of high intensity cardio and it shows a small number compared to the number on the cardio machine I use with heart rate sensors. But anyway, for the price I paid I am more than happy with my purchase. The battery lasts forever and also, the app allows you to customize many things, like the notifications you get on your phone, and you can also deactivate the watch light from turning on every time you turn your wrist, which to me is not a good thing, especially at night! The app functionality could improve a lot. When you go to the “User” section none of the menu items can be accessed, and when you click on them the app freezes and you have to reopen it again. I guess no big deal since you can still access all of the other stats, but it would be nice if it worked in the way it’s supposed to.

The smart watch is simple, when you swipe to the right, you have a shortcut function to enable heart rate, night mode, and a find my phone if you temporarily misplaced your phone. I tested the find my phone, and OMGGGG THE ALARM the phone makes you’ll definitely been able to find it! I love this feature! Wish i can do that with my AirPods and I was at one end of the room and the iPhone was on the other side!When you swipe to the left, there is a sports function with different types of activities there is running, walking, biking, hiking, climbing, treadmill, spinning, and yoga. If you’re going to do a specific activity, hit the mode, pause one click, finish two click easy as that! There is a function to check your heart rate status and alarm clock, timer, and a meditation sort of mode. The watch does come with notification but I won’t utilize that, I want to solely use this as a daily activities/exercise watch, but it does work.In order to use the watch property you have to download their app, the apps keeps records of different activities which is walking/sports activities, sleeping, and your heart rates. It shows a trend chart and report for each day.Overall the only activities mode I use solely is walking and tracking my sleeping pattern to improve my sleep. It’s nice to see I keep up with my daily exercise of walking which is 10,000 steps. The accuracy between the phone and the watch itself is about 200-300 steps discrepancies. The error is minor.

Yes its plastic, yes its screen is only 1900x1200, yes its Media Tek processor is not the top processor available today, yes it ONLY has 2GB of ram.  However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.  I have zero productivity apps on it (which i like) I have zero communication apps on it (which I like), This tablet for me is a way to get away from life.

Couldn't this be optimized better?I'm now quite upset and decided to return it, for the poorly designed software that drains battery and my deleted review by amazon!
",0.05782234767,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.08309632567,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

If you're already used to the way smartphones function, this will be a piece of cake!I've been playing with it since I opened the box and have discovered the sound quality, image quality and video playback to be superior to any other tablet I've used. Im pleased with the storage capacity and battery life as well.Downloading apps are easy too, through Amazon Appstore. Ive already been to all of my social media sites with it.It' s wonderful and powerful, in every way!

",0.97169971567,electronics,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

",0.2009450267,electronics,"I l logged in to increase my rating but my review was not there.  In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.  Hint to Tech Support:  Recommend this to callers if your hour+ of support does not produce results.

",0.96098804569,electronics," Coming from a Fire HD 7, then a ""Kids"" Kindle 8, this is really an impressive and welcome upgrade.So I really want, and need, to explain that the only difference between the ""kids edition"" and the regular one, other than price, is that the ""kids edition"" comes with--A kidproof case (and this one even has a kickstand!!) Which yes, the kindle kid cases are amazing with protection.-The year of Free Time, which is the kids gaming platform.-The 2 year replacement guarantee (that I have used in the past for a broken screen. SUPER easy process. You have to CALL Amazon to do this, it cannot be done via your order page; Return the kindle without case to Amazon, they ship you a replacement kindle without the case.)O N L Y differences. So when I see all of these negative reviews about the kids kindle, then I jump over to the positive reviews on the normal kindle, it's baffling. And I did compare the two because it's a $50 price difference, and what really sold this version for me, rather than buying everything separately, was the 2 year replacement guarantee.My child started out with my Fire HD 7, which you can switch between adult and kid profiles on as well. Any kindle can be a kids kindle as long as you've got a childs profile set up. Once she got bigger/older, we bought her the kids edition 8. So the kids edition 10 is her Christmas gift this year. It's so much faster than the 8, obviously bigger. And I loved that with having it connected to my account before shipment, setup was fast-All the hard work was done and I just had to select a pin for this device, it was set up and ready to go within 10 minutes. Memory card slot on the side, removal and replacement of the case is MUCH easier than on the 8. The volume on this thing is loud, crisp, and clear.With the 10, the only differences I've noticed that would be worth mentioning is that usually on the other kindles, you would pull down the settings bar to click on the icon and switch profiles. With this one it seems you've got to lock, click the icon, then switch profiles. Not a big deal to me and I'm sure it wont be to her. She uses my profile for regular youtube and roblox, just normal things that aren't accessible on the kids/free time dashboard. Other difference here is that it now uses a USBC charger, which is another positive since every phone in my house uses USBC so it's easier to replace and keep up with.The free time dashboard. Lots of negative feedback on that one; So sometime ago, maybe in the last year or 2 I think, free time had an update. I HATED the update. It jumbled literally everything together and she had to look for all of her downloaded games, just randomly clicking on everything. But this was a year or 2 ago and the dashboard on the 10 is no different than the dash on the 7 and 8. It's just the same free time update that's been there for a year or 2 now.She has an ipad air that we have her school apps on. They weren't available on kindle so we keep the ipad around for homework. She absolutely hates the ipad. So if your kid is an apple fan, they may not like this one. My daughter had 2 kindles before she got an ipad from a relative so she was already used to the interface. iPad is easy for her too but she would rather not use anything, than reach for the ipad when the kindle is dead/charging.For anyone wanting more in depth reviews on this Kindle, jump on over to the Kindle 10 listing and read them there because there is virtually no difference between the ""Kids Edition"" and the regular 10.
",0.82590067469,electronics," Amazon rushed this product. The tablet itself is so flimsy the screen is discolored and you barely push on it and it looks like the screen is going to break. I’m gently pressing on the screen and you can see it changing colors. Does NOT look childproof to me. Ridiculously overpriced.
",0.02501931869,electronics,"I thought it would be a good idea to get my daughter the new 10"". The restore option from her previous device did not work. Tried resetting it and it failed to complete 7 times. Support was absolutely useless, tried 3 different times hoping to get someone who might know the issue. They all said send it back for a refund. I gave up on the restore and set it up as a new device. The device seems well made but the support for it is absolutely useless, Simply disappointed!!
",0.08561432469,electronics,"You know when you are getting a tablet that is not an IPAD there will be some compromises, but overall I think it's a great tablet for the price.Cons:-Access to so much stupid/non-age-appropriate content that I felt the need to filter out-Longer than normal processing/downloading-Too many steps to change settings (shortcuts aren't as customizable)-Did I mention stupid content?Pros--Great Case-The warranty is worth the purchase!!!!-The option to download content so that when you are without wifi it still works well with no data usage-Freetime has lots of options for entertainmentI would recommend getting a large SD card so you aren't restricted to the number of apps that are able to be download. and also to have realistic expectations.

There was so much on there my son just spent the whole time clicking on everything instead of being able to play or watch anything.

Like another review I am very disappointed that the transfer option doesn't work. I reset the damn thing about 10 times trying to get the applications and data over. Also any SD card from an older device will not copy over, the SD card must be formatted on this device.I highly recommend getting a large SD card to go with this. We bought a 128GB card so I shouldn't need to ever worry about space.This is a great kids tablet with great screen. It is much faster than older models with increased storage. Including USB-C is wonderful and I can now get rid of my micro-usb chargers laying around.Highly recommended!
",0.78047579569,electronics,"I like it so far.  I upgraded from the previous Kindle Kids Fire 10 inch.  I think it's a worthy upgrade.  The battery life is better, processor I believe is snappier and most importantly it uses USB-C now so I can ditch the micro USB cables lying around my home and car.  The USB-C charges faster and in either direction, so I don't have to fumble around flipping the micro USB if it's dark.  However the included charger here is only 9W.  My chargers at home are 15 or 18W so I don't use the 9W one at all.I am docking 1 star on this because I can no longer install apps onto the microSD card.  That was possible on old Kids Fire tablets.I bought 2 of these at a 2 for 1 discount.  I also sent in my old Kids Fire 10 for a $30 gift card.  These are for my little toddler boys, who love them.  I do recommend getting this latest edition over any other Kids Kindle tablets.

It’sa kids tablet, should be easy to use, and this software is just opposite of that.Also, the software ota update failed, and that was ghe first thing that happened after I fed internet to the tablet.

",0.16686123670,electronics,"I write this review as the former owner of 3 Asus PG279Qs and one PG279QZ.  I was drawn to this realm of the monitor market because I do not believe that 4K displays are worth it at this particular point in time.  As far as I see it, the majority are a compromise as the bandwidth requirements for running 4:4:4 chroma subsampling, an extended color gamut, a refresh rate of 144 Hz and beyond, and a resolution of 3840x2160 all at the same time will be much better served by DP 1.5 or HDMI 2.1 (proper HDR wouldn't hurt either).  Although it could be argued that achieving 144 frames at 1440p is more resource intensive than 60 frames at 2160p, I believe the experience to be the most immersive, at least until 144+ frames becomes viable at 4K.  Unfortunately, based on the price to performance ratio trend of the current generation of graphics cards (Nvidia’s in specific), it is going to be a long, long time until that is achievable at a reasonable price.  All things aside, I can state with confidence that I’ve found my sweet spot for monitors in the form of LG’s 27GL850.  It has addressed all of the quality control concerns that I’ve experienced throughout my quest of trying to obtain a high refresh rate, 1440p IPS-type display.  Seeing as this is an LG product, the monitor can rightfully be referred to as having an IPS (In-Plane Switching) panel as this is their proprietary term for the technology that produces the wider color gamut and viewing angles.I did not buy this display because I am a hardcore gamer; I bought it because I wanted a quality monitor with good color reproduction, a uniform panel, and good response time.  My purchase was based solely on the off chance of LG producing a monitor where quality control wasn’t an after-thought.  Now that it has finally arrived, I am proud to report that this monitor delivers.  The display has zero backlight bleed and excellent uniformity, contrast, and response time.  White uniformity is even across the entirety of the screen while the factory calibrated colors appear accurate even next to my calibrated Dell.  Outside of sRGB mode, the colors do come off as over-saturated, although some may prefer the added vibrancy of the Nano IPS technology (I did not).  Black levels are on par with most other IPS-type displays that I’ve used despite the specified measurement coming in at a somewhat lower figure than similar displays.  As for response time, it seems universally accepted by the monitor community that the fast setting is adequate in preventing overshoot.  The faster and fastest settings produce undesirable artifacts known as coronas.  Despite this monitor not having variable overdrive, I have had no perceivable issues when it comes to gaming as I do tend to binge on CS:GO from time to time.If I had to nit-pick, and I do because this is a review where transparency informs prospective buyers, I will say that the strength of the presence of IPS glow on my display falls on the moderate end of the spectrum.  This could be due to the fact the panel is 27 inches, which is a decent amount of real estate for this phenomenon to occur.  It is also important to keep in mind that this is something that varies on a per panel basis.  Without a doubt, it is a consequence of choosing to utilize an IPS panel for one’s computing purposes.  Regardless, it is nothing unexpected or anything that cannot be addressed by adjusting the brightness level as well as the viewing distance, height, and angle.  Besides simply turning down the brightness, placing the monitor further away is one way to remedy the matter.  Another way to minimize the glow is to position the screen in such a way that one’s gaze meets the center of the screen as IPS-type displays fare better when the height of the top bezel is of equal height or greater in relation to one’s eyes.  A final tip is to manipulate the screen’s tilt angle as oftentimes angling it upwards reduces glow.By applying these adjustments, I can easily say that this is overall the best monitor that I’ve used to date.  I will not sit here and bash Asus’ most recent iteration of their high refresh rate, 1440p IPS-type display, the PG279QZ, as one can refer to the top review of the PG279QZ to see what types of problems plague those monitors.  What I will say is that it’s a breath of fresh air to see that quality control still exists in consumer-grade monitors.  Realistically, no manufacturing process is going to produce near perfect monitors all of the time; however, this purchase has instilled confidence in me when it comes to the LG brand.  I imagine that this model will provide all disillusioned monitor buyers a glimmer of hope when it comes to having a fighting chance at obtaining a quality monitor in this realm of the market.***As per a request in the comments, I've attached pictures of the monitor at brightness of zero, 50%, and 100%.***
",0.570,electronics,"LG set my expectations high for this monitor from when they first debuted it at CES 2019, but they have only let me down after release.  Even a couple months before release they were advertising this monitor as g-sync monitor, overclocking capabilities, and with sphere lighting.  Then about the week of pre-order time they took down the LG info page on this monitor and released this with only g-sync compatible, no overclocking, and no sphere-lighting.  They will deny all the things they promised, but you can find youtube videos on it.The monitor I received had 1 dead pixel on the bottom left, everything else was fine.  Brightness is enough for me, but like in Linus's review it's technically not bright enough to meet HDR certification.  I'm upgrading from a 24in 144hz 1ms TN monitor, so my gaming experience has definitely been better with this one, but I'm not impressed.  I'm subtracting one star for the dead pixel and two for not delivering on what they initially promised.  I don't care if it would have cost more for all the features I mentioned, LG advertised set the bar high on themselves.  I know what I want and I'm willing to pay for it, so don't use any cost cutting excuses.Thanks for reading.
",0.14881178770,electronics,"Let me start off my saying I currently own a 240Hz BenQ XL2546 monitor, but I've also owned the comparable Asus  1440P IPS PG279Q (formerly the best 1440p IPS panel), 240Hz Alienware AW2518H (one of the fastest panels in the world), Viewsonic XG2402 (highest rated 144hz 1080p TN panel), Samsung 144Hz VGA (nice colors and blacks, but blurring slow response times), and a 55"" LG OLED 4K TV @ 120Hz I occasionally use for the ultimate viewing experience.IN SHORT: It's hands down one my favorite gaming monitors for 2019. BUT, if you're a competitive gamer stick with a TN 240Hz panel.After spending years reading critical reviews, comparing performance measurements, and outright buying various panels trying to find the perfect balance of performance and picture quality, I wasn't impressed. But right now I can finally say this monitor checks enough boxes to be considered the best all around gaming panel I've ever owned.These are the metrics I used to calculate my review:Contrast: Below Average (At 770, it sits below average for most IPS panels between 1000-1200)Colors: Excellent (98% DCI-P3, average is about 90%, a bigger difference in reality than on paper)Resolution: Excellent (no screen door effect, can't see pixels even with larger 27"" screen)Response Time: Great (compared to a TN its average-fast, for an IPS its blazing)Input Lag: Excellent (4.3 ms, one of the fastest 144Hz panels on the market)Refresh Rate: Good (144Hz, wish it were at least 165 Hz)Though 4k 120Hz panels have better picture quality, all have terribly slow response times and some with unacceptable input lag (looking at you Predator X27). Then there's the ultrafast 240Hz panels which don't have the resolution or the colors to truly make content on your screen exciting.The fact is most panels come with significant sacrifices in performance or overall picture. But, I can say the LG gives you near top tier grades in all of metrics and will leave but the most competitive buyers satisfied with their multimedia and gaming experience. That's why  it's currently the best 144 Hz overall gaming panel on the market, especially at $500.Overall 4.5/5 Stars. 1/2 star off for the mediocre contrast levels and lack of features at this price range.Pros:Incredibly Low Input Lag (feels as fast as my 240Hz BenQ monitor)Crispy 1440P Resolution (easier to read text, see details in games and movies, and add a professional look to everything)Fastest 144Hz IPS Panel in the world (faster than many gaming TV panels, much smoother than the Asus PG279Q)Incredibly  Vivid & Wide Color Gamut (best I've seen on any gaming panel under $1000)Low Back light Bleed (Only very small bleed on the bottom corners. Great for an IPS but will vary from panel to panel)Minimalist Height Adjustable Stand (Doesn't swivel but that's not an issue for me, love the design and slim profile)Modern OSD + Nipple Joystick (Makes navigating the menu easy and intuitive with plenty of options)Solid Connectivity Options (Dual HDMI, Display Port, Headphone Out, and dual USB 3.0 Ports)Cons:Adaptive-Sync Adds Noticeable Stutter using nvidia GPU (never had this issue with any G-sync compatible panel in the past)Only 1 out of the 8 picture modes has full picture controlsMediocre Contrast Levels (typical of LG IPS Panels, not horrendous, but blacks can appear a bit washed in dark scenes)Average Input Lag for Console Gaming (Disappointing if you plan to use this monitor for console gaming)Stand Doesn't Swivel and May Not Adjust Low Enough for Some UsersWishes (not cons):BLUE LIGHT Filter (important eye health feature for extended viewing sessions)165Hz Overclock (like Asus PG279Q)RGB Sphere LightingHeadphone Stand (BenQ has one, its a clean way to hold the headphones when not in use)Built-In Speakers (Nice to have built-in speakers when needed as desk space is valuable)Bottom line: If you want the best gaming performance, stick with a 240Hz panel.

",0.95783609270,electronics,"Edit: Got one that has minimal BLB compared to this one. Now I don't struggle by looking at left corner of the monitor while watching movies or anything. IPS glow exists but BLB is minimal compared to the last one. Will update the picture later on. Colors are beautiful, response time is great, g-sync works out of the box flawlessly, gaming experience got much better with this monitor! Highly recommended (assuming you get a good model!)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons: Seems I lost the ""panel lottery"" as I noticed the BLB when playing dark themed games or watching movies. Build quality is OK.Pros: Pretty much everything else, it is a great monitor.BLB was so bad I had to return it. Doesn't feel good as I waited more than a month for this monitor to arrive. I'll be waiting for amazon to restock and order again, will give better ratings then.
",0.93313980170,electronics,"For under $380 I think it's going to be hard to beat this monitor. Especially since the 27GL850 is consistently out of stock. For the price you are getting:- Essentially the same panel as the 27GL850- Excellent response time + motion handling- Officially certified by Nvidia G-Sync support- FreeSync- sRGB color space- More money in your pocket- You can actually find this monitor in stockWhat's missing from it's bigger brother:- No USB ports- No wide gamut color support- No HDR (there isn't really any true HDR on the 850 either so you're not technically missing out)I didn't notice any back light bleed, stuck pixels, or excessive IPS glow on my unit. I almost hesitate to include pictures of the monitor when it's on because the pictures do not accurately show what I'm seeing in person. In the pictures it looks as if there may be some excessive glow in the top right and bottom left of the screen but I assure you that I absolutely do not see that in person and only via my camera.The contrast is ok. You're not going to get the deepest blacks but it still looks great and if you're not nitpicking, I don't think you're really going to notice it either. The color pops nicely though I recommend setting the brightness to at least 75-80 to get the most out of the picture. Tested out G-Sync with my GTX 1070 and have had no problems. G-Sync is on by default so you won't even have to go into your settings and mess with it. G-Sync only works via Display Port FYI.Knocking off a star because my stand wobbles a little bit where the foot meets the pole. It also comes with the shortest power cable I have ever seen. It's maybe 3 feet long. There is no swivel and It's entirely made of plastic so don't get your hopes up for metal anything.If you're looking for a monitor in this price range, I don't really see any need to look any further.
",0.04480418670,electronics,"What I liked:+ Great response times: I don't think anyone is going to miss their 144hz TN panel after using this.+ Near perfect gamma 2.2 tracking on default gamma 2 mode+ Average Delta-E around 1.5: not bad+ Amazing color gradient handling when set to 10bit mode+ No BLB or dead pixelsWhat I disliked:- Default whitepoint is too cool (measured 7200K) and none of the provided modes gave an actual 6500K. Luckily, with a colorimeter in-hand (Colormunki Display) I was able to calibrate to 6500K with minimal loss of contrast by adjusting the RGB gains.- IPS glow isn't any better than my old IPS monitors. You'd think now that tablet and laptop IPS panels have mostly resolved this issue that monitor panels would do that too.Other notes- Contrast measured at 870:1, a bit low for an IPS panel although I cannot subjectively notice a difference in black levels compared to my other IPS monitor that measured 1150:1. If you're looking for deeper blacks you're better off with a 3000:1 VA.- Gamma mode 2 is the only gamma mode that was calibrated at the factory. Changing the gamma mode to modes 1,3, or 4 resulted in a white point of 6300K, contrast ratio increased to 1060:1, however the gamma tracking is really bad on these modes.- Gamma mode 1 results in an approx gamma of 2.0, mode 3 is approx gamma 2.5, mode 4 is approx gamma 2.3, but again the gamma curves on these modes are messed up and do not conform closely to these numbers so I ended up using gamma mode 2 and just correcting the white point.
",0.24845418370,electronics,"Just set the screen up with my new 2080 Super.  Checked for dead pixels (none!).  Verified 144Hz.  Verified adaptive sync on.  Verified no PWM back-light strobing.  Fired up Hell Let Loose.  PROCEEDED TO LOSE MY MIND.This monitor was worth the wait.  Even the out-of-the-box color settings are superb.  I'm so so impressed.  I've gamed at 144+Hz before but never on a screen that looks this good.  Worth every penny.
",0.94492232870,electronics,"Update: After hearing back from LG today it appears to be a firmware issue so I've decided that I'm just going to return the monitor as defective (their other option is to ship it to them to have repaired which could take weeks).  I'm extremely bummed as the monitor is really nice, but I just don't have much faith in the monitor at this point and I'm not paying even more money for their service plan so it seems as if i'm better off getting something else.  Hopefully if you do end up buying this monitor you have better luck than I did. I did include one picture that shows how the monitor's input section screen was clearly glitched for reference.I've had this monitor about 2 weeks and I can say that it is beautiful - when it is working.  After about 2 weeks the monitor started not recognizing that my computer was connected to it and I have not been able to fix it.  I tried both HDMI and DP, in all ports, and with 2 different computers and I cannot get it to work.  The cords do work to our TV though.  This is leading me to think there is some issue with the monitors internal software, but even a factory reset didn't fix the problem.  I'm going to continue messing with this and I'm reaching out to LG but until I hear back or can get this fixed i'm rating this 1 star.
",0.02390986770,electronics,"I've been using an Asus VG278Q 27 inch monitor for a few years now which is 1080p, 144hz, and has a TN panel.The LG monitor has been a solid upgrade in the areas that count:- Resolution upgrade from 1080p to 1440p- Panel upgrade from TN to IPS- Retained 144hz refresh rate- Retained low input lagBy replacing the old Asus monitor with this LG, I've been able to keep the great gaming capability of a high refresh rate + low input lag TN panel monitor and receive an upgrade to a higher resolution and an IPS panel.I have a feeling a big target audience for this monitor will be folks with the same monitor I had or very similar...a 1080p 144hz TN panel monitor. If you have a similar monitor and are considering upgrading I don't think you will regret it, however the only downside so far is the monitor brightness is not its strong point. I turned mine up to about 90% and have been happy with that so far.
",0.30575120470,electronics,"I was waiting for this monitor for some time for one reason: it (seemed to) promise the motion handling of a TN in an IPS. Indeed, Linus's video along with the test results at rtings.com made it seem like a sure thing that it would AT LEAST be a significant improvement over previous gaming IPS displays. I still can't believe it, but upon inspection I saw no difference between this and my Acer XB271HU (and also my Acer just had a better picture overall).The only improvement over my Acer was comparing the LG's ""faster"" pixel setting to my Acer's max setting, but that was with significantly more artifacts and it still didn't touch the clarity of my previous gaming TN display. Now the issues of the ""1ms GTG"" claim with the faster setting was already known, but the test results and exact response times I read were NOT on this setting. This LG should still be much better when on ""fast"", but this was not the case for me.The salt in the wound is in the photo I posted: there was some kind of permanent black mark that was inside the screen (maybe dead pixels, but it looked odd), so this was a return item immediately anyway. I simply can't reconcile the pixel performance I observed with what everyone is saying, it's almost like mine is defective in some way other than the thing I just stated. Regardless, I'm disappointed in LG whose products I normally love (current and previous phone are LG).Assuming no defects, if this is your first gaming IPS display then it's probably DECENT. But given how its new ""nano IPS"" tech did no better than my 3-year-old Acer (which is still a bit pricier, actually, but also has native G-sync hardware, although I'm glad that's on its way out), and the defect which I know happens but is annoying nonetheless, I have to give a low mark.
",0.10046714571,electronics," Wanted an MP3 player to have as a standalone music player for times I don't want to take my phone with me. There's something to be said for not having to be connected 24 hours a day.First impressions of this player are that it's ::really:: solidly built. Construction seems to be a metal body frame and something like Gorilla glass on the front and back. It's small, so it's not too heavy to carry, but it feels substantial which is great.The device boots up really quickly and the touchscreen display is bright, clear and pretty sharp compared to other players I've seen in this price range. Really nicely done.Most navigation in the menus is done with the touch screen. Took me a minute to figure out that backing out of menu levels required swiping left or right, so don't be confused if you get down into something and can't figure out how to get out.Nice range of features built in, with the ability to watch videos and view photos in addition to the basic music functions. On the music side, playback of lossless files will certainly make audiophiles happy. I also really appreciate having a FM radio built in. The built-in speaker is a nice touch too, just in case you want to plop it next to you and hear something without the need for headphones.Haven't tested them with bluetooth headphones yet, but will update this review if I run into any issues that would impact my rating.
",0.82689237671,electronics,"I purchased this for our kids as a Christmas present.Upon unboxing, I was happy to see that it comes with a protective film on the front and back of the player.The touch screen is nice but it does take time to get used to how to use the touch screen (i.e. how to go forward, back, etc.).This MP3 player has many features but if you have a smartphone you may not end up using them (i.e. Calendar, ebook, stopwatch, alarm). I would not want to read an ebook on a device this small. It is about the size of the palm of my hand.I also used autotune to set FM Radio Stations but will need your headphones connected so it uses them as an antenna.In my opinion the best way to search for music is by the artist, otherwise, if you are just scrolling through all the songs, it is hard to decipher what is what and by who.You can turn the volume up not only on the side up and down buttons but also on the touch screen as well.I did not have any issues connecting my Bose Bluetooth headphones to this device. However, the speaker that is on the device (without using headphones) isn't bad. It would be a good device to play music on at your desk in an office setting, without running the battery down on your cell phone.Also, if you have your Bluetooth headphones connected when you plug the device into your computer, it will disconnect them.I have purchased two other small mp3 players recently for our other two children and I think this one is my favorite so far.
",0.90538752171,electronics,"It's a nice size, lightweight MP3 player that's easy to use. The screen is a responsive touchscreen that's just the right size to use without being too small or too large. You either tap the screen or swipe left or right. I would highly suggest reading the manual to see what everything does and how it works, but it's pretty easy to pick up on.A few features that stand out to me are the external speakers, folder interface, and radio. The external speakers are a very nice feature. The sound is pretty good, too. I honesty don't hear much difference from my phone's speakers (iPhone 5s) and this. The sound is surprisingly clear. Another thing I love is the folder interface. I like to organize my media myself and a lot of small electronics (e-readers, mp3 players, etc) don’t keep your original folder structure and organize your media it’s own way, but this player keeps everything exactly as is. I also really like the radio feature. I don't actually own a radio anymore (apart from the stereo in my car) so it's nice to be able to use this player as a radio, too.I’ve tested out multiple files and it’s been able to play every file extension I have. It’s also able to play audiobooks. It can’t save your progress, but it can play them. It’s not specified that audiobooks (specifically m4a files) are supported so I’m not holding it against the player that your progress isn’t saved since it doesn’t claim to be able to play audiobooks in the first place. I’ve played various audiobooks and podfics with no issue, though. It’s a surprise feature I noticed and really like.File transfer is also easy. I have a iMac (OS 10.14.6) and the player came up right away when I plugged it in and read it as an external drive. There was no needed software or anything. File transfer is as easy as dragging and dropping files.I wanted a compact, lightweight, easy to use MP3 player to take running and use around the house while cleaning instead of always having to drag around my phone with me and this has delivered. It’s nice to have something small and unobtrusive while I’m on the move. The included armband is comfortable to wear, easy to adjust, and perfect to wear while exercising or doing housework. Pair it with wireless earbuds and you’ll forget you’re even wearing an MP3 player.I would recommend this to anyone who doesn’t have a smart phone or is tired of having to drag around their cumbersome phone to use as an MP3 player. Sometimes you just want to listen to music and travel light and this is perfect for that.
",0.93418824771,electronics,"I bought this Searick, after recently buying the similar Rofeer and Akamate MP3 Players. Here I will compare all three. I bought them for playing through Bluetooth speakers and receivers, and I have concluded that these all are based on technology that existed before they added the Bluetooth capability, so the Bluetooth is an afterthought, and none of these deal with it as a user would want. The Searick is best, only requiring 6 touch strokes after turning on to reconnect to the Bluetooth receiver it was connected to when it was turned off and resuming music play, which is actually bad, but the Rofeer requires a minimum of 10 stokes to reconnect and resume music, and the Akamate skips the first 2-6 seconds of every song, so the Akamate is worthless for playing through Bluetooth, even though I tried it because it takes fewer strokes than the Rofeer to reconnect after off-on. I'm returning the Akamate due to the worthless Bluetooth, but if you are using without Bluetooth, the Akamate has the benefit of being the only one that will go right to resuming play where it left off when you turn it off and back on, without any key strokes, but again, only if using it without Bluetooth.The Searick and Rofeer both have almost identical graphics and functions, but there are significant differences, and the Searick is a True Touch Screen, and the Rofeer is Not touch screen - it has touch buttons below the screen, as does the Akamate. The graphics on the Searick and the Rofeer are excellent, whereas the graphics on the Akamate are not as nice, its functions are similar to the other two, but the Akamate User Interface is noticeably different than the other two, which does have a few advantages, requiring fewer strokes in some cases than the Rofeer, but the Searick is a true touch-screen, so the Searick almost always requires fewer stokes than the Rofeer or the Akamate. I like the touch buttons in that it is easier to be sure what you are pressing and fewer mistakes, but when you can make so many fewer strokes with the Searick touch-screen, that makes it the best. The Searick swipe-right capability also adds a significant ability not available on the touch-button models, which only have a return button (equivalent to swipe left) but don't have an equivalent to the swipe right. For example, in the Searick, you can swipe right on the song in the file menu that is already currently playing to get back to the now-playing screen without interrupting its play, whereas with the two button-based players, you only have the option to press OK on the current song in the file menu, which causes them to start the song over from the beginning. If you want to start the song over from the beginning in the Searick, you can by pressing the song in the file menu instead of swiping right.Another Huge Advantage of the Searick over the Rofeer is that you can Forward (skip a song), or Rewind (start song over or go to previous song) with a long press of the side volume buttons even when the Screen is Off/Lock is on. I am not sure if the Akamate can do that also, I think it can, but I have already boxed it up for sending it back, so I haven't tried that. It's important to be able to control the skip forward/back with the screen off, because battery life is way longer with the screen off.On the subject of battery life, all of these models have some serious negatives. As far as I can tell, none of them have replaceable batteries, so in a few years they will be junk. Come on, let us replace the batteries. Another common fault is none of these have a true on/off switch. The ""on/off"" button is what is called a soft button, which requires power to read it, so after some number of days even without turning it on, the battery will be drained. Come on, put a real on/off slider on it!The Searick is smaller, and more ergonomic in that you can hold it in the left hand and press both the volume and the power buttons with your left thumb, or hold it in your right hand and control both the volume and the power buttons with the right fingers, so in either hand it's one-hand operation, especially with the Searick ability to Forward or Rewind with a long press of the Volume buttons even with the screen off and locked.One advantage of the Rofeer over the Searick is that it allows you to view Pictures while listening to Music via Bluetooth, but while viewing pictures while playing music with the Rofeer, the pictures are smaller than full screen. If not playing music, all these players can show pictures full screen. When playing music on the Searick via Bluetooth, if you try to view a picture, it will warn you it will disconnect from Bluetooth, whereas on the Rofeer you can view reduced-sized pictures while staying connected and playing.All these models have the fault that they don't update the curser/place in the file menu when you forward or rewind songs, so if you do a bunch of forward and or rewinds while playing, then go back to the file menu, it will still be where you started the first song instead of the song that is now playing.They all always default to the local folder first, so if you always play from an inserted card it's annoying, and it would be nice to have the option of listing the card folder first, or automatically if there is nothing in the built-in storage.It would be nice to be able to copy the card files to the built-in storage with the unit, so you don't have to connect it to a computer to do that.The Searick appears to only be able to scroll up or down a full screen (6 tracks), and the other two models can only scroll up or down one track. The Searick cannot do Apple-device-like fast multi-screen scrolls or partial screen scrolls. It would be great if it could, but since the Searick is a touch-screen, at least once you have the desired song on the screen, you can go right to it, instead of having to press the up of down buttons some number of times before pressing OK like on the Rofeer or Akamate.It should be noted that the Searick came with an offer to give me $20 for a 5-star review, but I obviously didn't take them up on that. On one hand, you can factor in that maybe some of the 5-star reviews were bought, or on the other hand you might hope for a free $20 off if you buy the Searick. In any case, I am honestly telling you I like this one the best compared to the other two I've tried.That's all I got. I hope this is helpful. Please rate this review as helpful, so Amazon will place it higher up.
",0.571,electronics,"I have had a few different MP3 players recently that are all around the same price point and it seems as if each one of them is decent but lacking in one department or another.  The Searick MP3 player is honestly checking all the boxes.1.  The build quality of this is awesome.  It has a solid nice black metal frame that looks premium and is heavy and durable.  The size of it is great not too big nor too skimpy.2.  The Video player actually works!  I have had a few other MP3 players that advertise that their Video play works however the conversion of the file format does not work.  This one actually works....huge plus!3.  The accessories are great as I do like the armband because I like to work out and have it there with me and not in my shorts flying around.4.  The Bluetooth connection is quick and works well.  Some of the other MP3 players the connection was not that strong and the Bluetooth sound would be spotty at best.5.  Last but not least the sound is decent coming out of the player it gets loud but might be a little lagging in the clarity department but its not some expensive iPhone 10 or something premium that we are used to considering its price point.Added bonus the built in speaker is pretty cool too and works well!Overall I am very satisfied with the look, build, features, sound, and pricing of this bad boy!
",0.81363695971,electronics,"Highly suggest this MP3 player!!!  I recently purchased the Searick 16gb MP3 player for listening to music while I ride my ATV.  I used to use my phone but my phone would lose its charge before the riding was done.  So, I bought the Searick MP3 player so I wouldnt have to use my phone.  The arm band was super useful for me since I use it while riding my ATV.  The arm band kept is secure and dry, and was comfortable to wear.  I thought it was gonna be difficult to put my music on the player, but no, it was as easy as I could have hoped for.  The fact that the MP3 player has the ability to play radio as well is a BIG bonus for the long car rides when the kids want to listen to different music than us adults!!  When I purchased the player I didnt realize that it would also play videos, but it can!!!  The video file/format/resolution do matter though so keep that in mind.  I had a hard time finding video that would play on it but was eventually able to find some.  I really like that i can store/show my pics on this player as well.  The bluetooth was easy and connected to all of my devices with no issues.  The earbuds that come with it sound pretty good and the player actually has a decent volume level which is nice when riding a loud ATV.  Overall I am VERY happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good and easy to use MP3 player!!

There is also a control to mute your microphone if you choose to and they include an adapter that splits into two different cords for PC. One for a separate mic function and the other for audio. The microphone is great. I own the K8headphones by them as well and the mic on these sound better after comparing them on a pc recording software. The earcups on these headphones are not earshaped. They are circular and not in an oval shape so if you have big ears, they may hurt. Other than that, it is a good buy. I took a few pictures and some in the dark to showcase the lighting they have. I tried to get pictures of each of the different lights the headphones switch to

They are well made, have very good sound and are an excellent value for the money. I am done buying expensive headphones that barely make it past the warranty period when I can get similar quality for 20% the price with these.
",0.84113949574,electronics,"Great sound quality and it looks good as well. Little uncomfortable for larger heads.I have also a K1 headset from RUNMUS. Here is how they compare:Pros:1. Has a RGB light switch which is a great new feature. Unlike the K1, you can easily turn the lights off at night without having to unplug the USB connector. It also has a microphone on/off switch, similar to the K1.2. Sound quality is good, similar to K1. Not like the $200-$300 headsets you can buy, but surprisingly good for the price. Surround sound also works great when playing games.3. Looks great, build quality is solid, and the cushions are very soft.Cons:1. Tight for my large head, works well for my 10 year old son. The K1 is a little wider and doesn't put as much pressure on the head, especially when using it for a longer periods of time.Overall, a very good gaming headset and for the price, it's a steal.

And this one is sturdy enough that it will hold up well to my kids’ antics!
",0.9867103774,electronics,"I had the model before this one came out and have been very happy with it, so when this one dropped I figured it was worth a shot. The comfort and fit of this headset is improved in the sense that it is more adjustable for people who have smaller heads so that it is a tighter fit. This headset also appears to be noise cancelling and maintains a solid seal over the ears while in use. The sound quality is also pretty fantastic, especially with movies where you really get the 7.1 surround sound kicking. Also when you’re using the headset, the chat clarity is spot on...and the microphone quality is certainly a step up from the previous model. All in all I’ve been very pleased with this headset and honestly believe you can’t beat this headset for the money!
",0.88035595474,electronics,"This set of headphones is an upgrade to the previous one in really only a couple of areas.  They seem to be just a little bit lighter but still have the same ear comfort, soft pads that cover the whole ear, No complaints from people that I talk to using the mic.  The other upgrade is the visual lighting on the side, this one the lights ""rotate"" so it adds just a little bit of awesomeness.  You can choose to have the USB plugged in for this or keep it unplugged and the light doesn't come on.  I usually have mine off.  I only counted the Comfort down a spot because of the weight but I'd be surprised to find a headset that would push that to a 5.
",0.575,electronics,"Updated Review on Oct 6, 2019:After nearly a year of using it, I noticed that the issues I mentioned in the original review were largely negligible while reading. The pinhole near the corner was never bothersome because I'd have to remember to look very closely to see it. The battery can last for a long time during hibernation, even for many many weeks if not used. I also hardly remember to notice the uneven screen color temperature. The only thing that's still a bit inconvenient is the glare. When near a window I'd have to adjust my reading angle to avoid the glare. It's something hard to overcome with a digital device and it's not a big compromise for light-weight and convenience. Therefore please take my original review below with a grain of salt, I was nitpicking on a device that I had a lot of expectations for. I also decided to change the 3 stars to 4 stars.Original review on Nov 12, 2018 (with updates on Jan 26, 2019):I have owned a Kindle Paperwhite since 2014. I really liked that old one and gifted it away a while ago. Perhaps I have had too much expectation for this new 2018 version (waited for many months for the release), I felt quite disappointed with a few of its issues.First I must be clear that I am a fan of e-books, and I think Kindle Paperwhite has always been a nice device, light, easy to use, easier on the eyes than an LCD screen, easy to look up words, etc. I also used a Kindle Oasis for a couple of days, I don't feel comfortable with the hard slick aluminum back, and its front lights are located on the sides, so the slight uneven light can be observed from left to right; while for Paperwhite with bottom lights, the unevenness is from top to bottom, meaning within each text line, the light is usually even, therefore less distracting to reading.Here comes the new 2018 Paperwhite:I like the screen is flat with the bezels now. However, both the first device I received and the subsequent replacement have a bright pinhole dot under the screen (see photos). It's like a piece of tiny defect or dust above the e-ink text and located in the light distribution layer (my guess). When the front light is adjusted to a high level, the dot becomes quite bright and distracting. I was surprised the second device had the same issue (just my luck or something else is going on here?), but because it's near the corner, I decided to live with it. This pinhole bright spot issue apparently can be found on the previous generations as well based on many reviews, I am just astonished Amazon hasn't fixed it.Also, I don't know what happened with the charging cable, it took me a lot of effort to plug it into the device, and pull it out, it's like as if the connectors are not made well.(Update Jan 26, 2019: the difficulty of plugging in the cable only occurred during the first couple of uses, it became normal and smooth later.)Also, the screen feels easier to smudge than my old Paperwhite. The texts appear slightly blurrier where there are fingerprints.Another issue is that the screen has a ton of reflection from bright windows or light sources (please see my photo, taken under an east-facing window in the afternoon). I don’t remember if it has always been like this or it’s because of the new screen update. Even with the window blinds shut, I had to tilt Kindle to certain angles to avoid the glare, albeit softer than on an LCD screen, still quite distracting. Under the same lighting, a real paperback has no reflection glare issues.Furthermore, when front light is on and when external ambient light is somewhat dim, my replacement Kindle Paperwhite appears a bit yellower near the bottom, especially on the left side, it’s distracting but hopefully, I’ll get used to it. It’s like real paper books getting old and parts of pages turning yellow—I try to convince myself.(Update Jan 26, 2019: other reviewers have mentioned issues with poor battery life. My experience is similar that if I don't use it for a few hours, even with WiFi turned on, the device will enter something like a hibernation mode, which requires a bit more time to wake up, but it allows the battery to last for many weeks if left on the shelf. If I read about 1-2 hours a day with wifi on, the battery drains very quickly, and will hardly last beyond a week. However, If you keep airplane mode on during reading, it will significantly conserve battery, the only inconvenience is that if you don't know a word and the dictionary also doesn't have it, which is quite likely the case, Wikipedia won't be able to show up without WiFi.)Perhaps I’m just asking too much for a digital device. Overall, it’s still a great device to read books, and Amazon still provided a fast replacement when I asked. However, with these experiences, I can no longer swear to e-readers. I don’t write reviews often, but I feel strongly about this product and sincerely hope it will help fellow costumers and help Amazon improve their devices.
",0.05769711775,electronics,"If you own an earlier Paperwhite and it's still functional there is no compelling reason to buy the Gen 4 ""All-New"" Paperwhite ( Amazon misleadingly refers to this as ""10th Generation"". It's a 10th generation Kindle e-reader but only the 4th generation Paperwhite ) unless a limited degree of water resistance (not waterproof as they claim) is important to you or you want Bluetooth capability for Audiobooks. Neither of these are remotely important nor needed by me in an e-reader and Audiobooks are handled better by smaller, lighter and less power hungry devices. The additional storage is coals to Newcastle as Amazon's cloud can hold any overstorage needs an owner has. Personally, I don't know anyone who has ever run out of onboard storage on any Kindle, including the very first keyboard models, despite loading them with hundreds of books. The much touted, by Amazon, thinness and lightness of this edition is, in my opinion, overblown. Yes it is slightly thinner and slightly lighter but not paradigm changing. Also beware: the supplied micro USB cable packaged with mine will not fit into the device, maybe yours will. All in all I find it breathtakingly stupid and/or venal of Amazon to ship a device so poorly engineered and quality controlled as to not have a functional charging cable. I bought this Kindle solely to replace a Gen 3 whose battery was failing. Amazon took every other Paperwhite edition off the website and left no choice but this one at $10 more than the previous edition. It's a Kindle, it's fine, but it's no game changer. If you buy it thinking it is I think you'll be disappointed.
",0.06479641875,electronics,"I love Kindle, have always had one since the first edition.  This is my third PaperWhite version of the Kindle.  The battery life is non-existent.  If you leave the WiFi option on, it drains the battery life within 9-10 hours even if you are not using the device.  If you disable the WiFi, the battery life lasts a bit longer (approx 3-days) using the device 2-3 hours a day.  The low rating is because of the very low battery life and inability to keep WiFi on all the time.  Otherwise, my Kindle is my best friend.  I most likely will return it because of the lack of battery longevity.
",0.02740696175,electronics,"I feel I need to approach this review from 2 perspectives:1. If you are somewhat new to the Kindle experience and you bought this one.2. If you are a previous Kindle or Paperwhite owner and upgraded to this one.If you are NEW TO THE EXPERIENCE or upgrading from an old Kindle like a Keyboard, welcome. This new Kindle merits 5 stars. You're going to love it. Here are some Kindle Paperwhite features you'll enjoy:* Built in light. Reading in bed while someone is trying to sleep next to you is now an easy joy.* Touch screen. Getting around your Kindle is easy. Turn pages, shop in the store, all by touching the screen.* Waterproof. This is a new feature to this Kindle. Bring it in the pool worry free!* Bluetooth. Sync this up with a speaker or headphones to have a book read to you.Besides that, this Kindle is thin and light. It doesn't fatigue your hand at all. The fonts are adjustable for size. The light is adjustable for brightness. The color of the light is somewhat grayish. My older Paperwhite had the blueish hue which I found a little unnatural. I bought the Amazon case and when you close the cover the Kindle automatically sleeps and when you open the cover it automatically wakes up. I find this Kindle to be a little faster than the previous version. If this is your first Paperwhite there is only reason to be content with your purchase.Now, if you are UPGRADING FROM AN OLDER PAPERWHITE I'd still be happy (I'm still glad I did upgrade) but there were a few things that made me go hmmmm.First off I expected this Kindle to have the latest software. It didn't. I'm waiting for the update where the home page scrolls and you could save font themes. Why doesn't a brand new Kindle not have the latest software? Not a deal breaker because I know the update will be coming, but my old Paperwhite was updated. Last time I checked the update page it didn't even show the update for this version. A little disappointing.Secondly, I had the Paperwhite from a few versions ago, the one with 212 ppi. Upgrading to this one with 300 ppi, I expected the font to be sharp, bold, and clear. Well, I'll just say that it didn't stink. Actually I found it to be a little greyed out, a little washed out to say it another way. Now, this is totally adjustable of course. The font could be bolded and size changed. But again, a little disappointed.The software is exactly the same as my older version, minus the upgrade of course. I wish Amazon would give us more fonts to choose from. I know that we could download fonts now but it would just be nice if they were built in to begin with.So my two biggest gripes are not shipped with the latest software and underwhelming font sharpness. From this perspective I'd give it a 3 1/2 or 4 star rating.But having said that I have no regrets upgrading at all. I would do it again. The Paperwhite experience in general is something I find amazing. When I'm finished with a book I go right to the store and check out samples, download free classics, or pull the trigger on a purchase based on my mood right then and there. I wouldn't trade it for anything.If you are new to Kindle or upgrading from a really old one don't let my gripes deter you. The Paperwhite is the gold standard of e-readers. At an affordable price you're getting this gold standard. And since this Kindle boasts being waterproof, bluetooth, being thinner and lighter, and with 8gb of storage, it's a no brainer.
",0.83450281675,electronics,"It’s infuriating that Amazon went to market with this machine. Do not upgrade from prior Paperwhites.1. To unlock the device, it goes through a long “waking up” period where the backlight is turned up full blast for some reason. It then reverts to your normal backlight setting after unlocking. I blind myself every night reading in bed. All previous Paperwhites unlocked instantly, with no dumb backlight. After you lock it, it will unlock instantly again for a few minutes afterward, so it seems to be “going to sleep” in some deeper way — probably to save battery life.2. It is not significantly lighter, but it is just SLIGHTLY smaller so that it doesn’t fit in the old Paperwhite cases. They obviously did this just to force you to buy a new case. Even worse, there are hardly any cases that fit this design—even from Amazon.3. The battery life is bad, possibly because of the Bluetooth connection. You can turn it off in the settings menu with the WiFi, but it’s disappointing that they only added a feature by making battery life worse AND adding that stupid “waking up” process.Pros:Yes, it’s waterproof—although I mainly go it to stop dog hair being caught in the screen edges. The Bluetooth feature for audible does work, although it’s not better in any way than using your phone.It seems to have more precise control over the backlight brightness... after it wakes up and blinds you.Bottom line: this is not a finished product, and they shoved it out the door because they wanted to have it out for Christmas.
",0.02335837575,electronics,"This is my fourth Kindle. I started with the classic, moved to the one with a keyboard, and then the Paperwhite, and now the Paperwhite 2.0. I've now had it for five days. When I got it, I fully charged it.I haven't tested this in water, so the only thing I can put in the pros column is the increased storage. Otherwise, it seems exactly the same as the original Paperwhite. I don't want to return the device because I can work around the issues, but I also don't want to give it a great rating given the issues I've seen so far - hence the three stars.**Issues I had with the original Paperwhite that persist with this version:**1. Occasionally unresponsive screen. When pressing to go forward or back, the device will sometimes freeze for a second before performing the required command. Based on other reviews, I can only assume this is a device issue. I was hoping it would be fixed with this version, but apparently not.2. Battery doesn't meet marketing claims. I'll be clear upfront: I read a lot, and I read fast. I average three to five books a week, depending on the length of the book. 30% of my reading is done on my phone via Kindle app, and the other 70% is done on my Kindle.Amazon claims ""battery lasts weeks."" If you don't use the device, that may be true. If you do, though, I'd say it lasts about a week. In the five days I've had this device, I've spent about twenty hours reading on it. The battery is half gone, so I assume its full life is 40 hours. Not bad - if the marketing claim said that the battery lasts a week (singular). Again, not enough to make me return the device, but it's annoying - especially given the increased price.**Issues I had with the original Paperwhite that I haven't experienced with this version:**1. Struggling to open large documents or books and occasionally crashing and freezing when getting too far into the document.2. Slowing down when more books were downloaded. It performed best when only 8-10 books were downloaded on the device at a time and the others were cleared out.3. Fully charged battery running out after six consecutive hours of reading, requiring a recharge (annoying, given the ""weeks"" statement when it didn't even last a day).I'll update this review later to confirm if these last issues are resolved with this new version or if they crop up after more use.
",0.04883950975,electronics,"After almost 4 years what do we get? Nothing of practical use. Is 8gb of storage really necessary? Of course not, unless you have 10,000 side-loaded books that will take you 20 years to read. Waterproof? After 10 years of owning Kindles I’ve never needed it. So unless you’re Michael Phelps or love to read underwater with goggles on its not necessary. Bluetooth? Does a real book have bluetooth? Worse yet, there is no immersive reading so it’s pointless....Why is this the the worst Paperwhite yet?It feels flimsy and hollow. It still has the same design as the original Paperwhite, you know the one released back in 2012 which makes it 6 years old. It still has the same Dinosaur bezels and now attracts more reflection, smudges and fingerprints than ever before. There is so much glare on this thing my girlfriend uses it to put make-up on. No but seriously a more appropriate name would have been the ""Kindle Refection"" or the ""Kindle Pinhole"" due to going through three different exchanges due to pinholes and dead pixels. It's sad. In my opinion, the previous Paperwhite 3 is better with the paper-like feel of the screen, it also has no glare and much better contrast and clarity. The new Paperwhite suffers from this as well as the dull and uneven lighting as seen in the picture. It also feels cheaply made and you can tell Amazon cut corners in assembly. As an example, the Voyage is also lighter but feels sturdy and solid in the hand whereas the new Paperwhite feels empty. Needless to say this new release is a major disappointment, but thats what happens when Amazon has no competition, the customer is the one to suffer. We all lose. Amazon is not innovating, they are not doing anything to improve the Kindle in practical ways that matter. More storage, waterproof and bluetooth are all gimmicks that the 99.9% of us don’t need. Its all a marketing scam.What would have been nice is page turn buttons, less monstrous bezels, less glare, and Comfort light (the adjustment of color temperature for nighttime reading). Even the Glowlight 3 has it, and it’s 2 year old technology. Side by side this Paperwhite is worst in every way that matters next to my Paperwhite 3. I'm just disgusted with Amazon right now for slacking and making us wait so long for a mediocre device. Lastly, what is up with the White Logo? Talk about distracting! Amazon went black on black with the Paperwhite 3 to avoid distractions and allow for a more immersive reading experience. To go back to a white distracting logo makes absolute no sense. Why Amazon? Here is a side by side picture of the new Paperwhite 4 which should be adequately named (on the left) and the superior Paperwhite 3 (on the right). The choice is clear.
",0.06323641575,electronics,"I am an avid reader and adore the new paperwhite!  To me, it’s the perfect reader. No light bleed thru, easy to control the amount of backlight, easy to download books and simply just easy to read my books.  It did not come with the very latest software uploaded but within 24 hours of being connected to my WiFi, the kindle updated itself.  Honestly, I’ve never purchased a smart phone that didn’t need an update within minutes of activation...Android or Apple.Using overdrive on my phone or tablet, it’s easy to borrow books and return books from my library. The newest update allows you to return right from your paperwhite and that is a huge improvement. As a prime member, I get a free book every month plus I follow several emails that alert to free or greatly discounted books.  8 GB of storage is way more than enough for me.

",0.0623160375,electronics,"My Kindle Voyage developed pinhole light bleeding so I decided to trade it in for $50 and a discount on a new Kindle.  First, I bought the Oasis - what a total disappointment!  High price and yet awkward to hold, awkward dimensions, horrendous battery life (mere hours), slow to boot up and lousy cover options.  Back it went.  I wasn't about to shell out a premium price for the exact same (old) Voyage tech and the Paperwhite was too big a downgrade (and ALSO long in tooth), so I held off on choosing a replacement.  I was very disappointed when all they came out with is this new Paperwhite, but I got it anyway.  At this point I'll stick with it, but if I could go back, I'd get a Kobo.This newest Paperwhite is ""meh.""  It's OK.  But it's only OK.  No night mode like the Kobo.  Light, but too small and very cheap feeling.  Case is the same overly expensive price, but feels and looks cheaper than the older Paperwhite cases (Hubby still has his 2nd Gen Paperwhite) - they even omitted the little silver tag on the cover, which jazzed it up a bit.  Like the Oasis, the newest Kindle Paperwhite takes several seconds to turn on - it's bad enough even my husband commented on it when we compared devices.  What on earth are they doing to make these SLOWER than old models?  How do they think people will find this acceptable?  My Surface Pro 4 runs an actual Windows 10 operating system and it boots at least as fast - faster than the Oasis.  Yes, the new Paperwhite is waterproof, but I've never NEEDED waterproofing, so I don't really care.  Backlight is OK but nothing special.  Screen is the same old epaper screen.The new Paperwhite isn't truly bad and it's definitely not great...it's just ""OK"".  It's DEFINITELY preferable to the Oasis.  If you aren't committed to the Amazon ecosystem for books, I'd suggest you check out Kobo or some other ereader brand, instead.  Amazon seems to be really missing the mark with their ereaders these days and it's truly disappointing.
",0.06565469576,electronics,"We’ve been using the Ring Peep Hole Cam (formerly called the Door View Cam) since its release in June 2019.  Our Peep Hole Cam is part of a comprehensive Ring security and camera system in an urban environment on a busy city street.What works:When first released, the Peephole Cam had a major streaming latency problem.  When motion was detected or when someone rings/knocks, it took ten seconds or more for the camera to stream the video to the user’s phone.  Ring recently released a new ""Rapid Ring"" app--it's a separate app that completely eliminates this video streaming latency.  It works well, and is designed as a companion to the full-featured Ring app.The physical design of the Peep Hole Cam is great--much smaller form factor than the other Ring doorbells, battery is inside the door where it stays at room temperature and is less likely to be stolen.  Battery power, even on a busy urban street, lasts for months--the battery is also easy to change when needed.  The appearance of the device, both outside and inside, is quite good.  It's modern and doesn't degrade aesthetics at the door.What doesn't work:Ineffective Custom Motion Zone ControlsWhen the Peep Hole Cam was released, Ring said that its primitive means of setting custom motion activity zones on its battery and solar powered cameras (including the Peep Hole Cam) would be updated to the more effective custom motion zone setting capability of its AC-powered cameras.  As of this writing, Ring has not released this update, meaning that if you’re using the Peep Hole Cam on a busy street there will be scores of false positives even when the device is set to the least sensitive setting.  The custom motion zone setting capability is so imprecise as to be useless, and all the false positives become annoying.  Since motion alerts don't work well, we have reluctantly turned them off, which limits the value of the camera as a home security device.Knock Sensor IneffectiveWe have the knock sensor set on its most sensitive setting, but the sensor has never once activated based on someone knocking on the door.  This feature simply doesn't work, at least not with a solid wooden exterior front door like ours.Poor Field of ViewAs mentioned in our original review, the camera’s field of view does not cover the lower area in front of the door, so it cannot be used to monitor packages.Please see the attached two photos--one photo is of the front of our place, showing the Peep Hole Cam mounted in the front door.  The other photo shows the view from the Peep Hole Cam.  Note that the entire area in front of the door even including the stairway leading up to our front door, which extends out for about six feet, doesn’t appear in the Peep Hole Cam’s field of view, while the camera does show--of no security value--lots of sky.  It’s remarkable that Ring, an Amazon company with a strategic imperative to reduce package theft, hasn’t addressed this deficiency.Our assessment after 5 months of use:All in all, five months after release, the Peep Hole Cam continues to have serious design deficiencies, that at least for this location, render it less useful than it could be.  We were obligated to purchase a second Ring outdoor camera that we have pointing at our front door to monitor packages and to create motion alerts around the front of our place.While it is great that Ring has addressed the video streaming latency issue,  it's disappointing that they haven't fixed the camera's other deficiencies that really limit the utility of this otherwise good design.  Based on these factors, we continue to rate this camera at three stars.Here’s what we said in June:We had been waiting for the release of this camera.  We received and installed it on June 21.Positives:Small exterior form factor, battery inside the door where it is less subject to temperature extremes and cannot be stolen, knock sensor and integrated peephole with a doorbell and high-res camera.  All great features unique to the Door View Cam in the Ring smart doorbell range.Negatives:When installed in a peephole at normal viewing height, the camera does not show the area directly in front of the door where delivered packages would be left.  The camera lens appears to be sufficiently wide angle but just not aimed correctly--depending on the installation, video recordings will show the sky or the ceiling of the hallway (minimal security value), but not the lower area in front of the door. For this camera to monitor not only visitors but also delivered packages it would either need to have a better fixed camera angle, or be mounted 2-3 feet from the floor, or allow the camera angle to be adjusted by the user.Mounting the Door View Cam on a door facing a busy street even when motion sensitivity is set to the lowest levels generates lots of false positives.  To eliminate false positives requires turning off motion detection since there is no effective way to set and adjust the motion zones.  Ring offers motion zone customization on some of its other cameras.  Why not on the Door View Cam?  [UPDATE: Ring got in touch on this.  They are intending to transition their battery-powered cameras, including the Door View Cam, to the more advanced motion detection used on their plug-in cameras.  No release date yet on a firmware update.]There is significant latency between when someone knocks or rings the doorbell and when the video and doorbell ring appear on one’s phone.  From talking to Ring Technical Support I understand that there is a focus on reducing this latency.The  final negative in the design is that the peephole is low quality--poor optics with lots of distortion and minimal light transmission, making it difficult to see anything with any detail.  Even a $20 peephole viewer has better optics than this $200 state of the art camera.We like Ring equipment and consider it the most functional home security system on the market--generally well-designed, well-performing and reliable.  This camera is a rare miss.  Hopefully Ring will address these problems as much as possible in a firmware update and release a 2.0 version of the camera in the near future.
",0.21775713676,electronics,"Let me preface this review with the following statement: I am never asked for my opinion on security products because of my occupation and expertise. Now that we've got that out of the way... lets discuss this subpar product from Ring.I am a first and last time Ring product purchaser. The Ring Doorview camera was a novel idea... just a poor concept in actuality. To put it short.... it does nothing well (besides being a delayed people watcher).Knock on the door after setting the device up for knocks... nothing. Turn on the live view feature for real time monitoring... its buggy and has a very obvious delay. Those precious seconds of delay are a serious issue... and no one should discount or attempt to belittle that.The field of view from the doorview camera is downright pathetic. You absolutely cannot see the bottom of your doorway. This glaring factoid is a major security issue.I have several videos demonstrating the ineffectiveness of this device. The doorview camera is useless when an individual approaches from an angle or kneeling position. The delayed camera activation even in its most sensitive setting will allow you to be compromised. A person can straddle a wall, kneel under the camera and walk away before the device can activate!2 hundred dollars for this... no way!I will readily admit that I purchased this device thinking that it would have an adequate field of view... and this isnt the case. The camera is flawed, the system is flawed, and it is quite simply a rushed to market product that needs further tweaking. I cant monitor parcel deliveries at my door because a high spot on my neighbors wall and the top pf their doorway is more important to Ring!Now, with all of that being said. I must comment on how awesome Rings customer support is. Within an hour of my initial review... I received an email from a customer service representative. The rep. was cordial and worked tirelessly to ensure that I was satisfied with Ring products. The rep. communicated multiple times via telephone and email with me and listened to my concerns.Afterwards, the rep. immeditely shipped a different Ring device to me to try in place of the doorview cam along with a few other things. This level of customer service is awesome however, the replacement device is locked in IR/night vision mode... and only films in Black and White.I greatly appreciate the awesome customer service from Ring... but I will be immediately returning their subpar products to them.So, in short... The Ring Doorview Camera has awful blindspots, is buggy with a seriously delayed response and the Ring Doorbell 2 has software issues that will make it default to ""night vision"" in a very well lit area.Thanks, but no thanks Ring!
",0.1709945276,electronics,"First off, I am an owner of a few Ring products, an IP security camera system and a few Wyze cams. I am frequently asked for my opinion on security products because of my occupation and expertise.I’m looking at the Ring Door View Camera for my apartment dwelling friends and I feel obligated to chime in and write this review after seeing that the most helpful and liked reviews giving the product 3 stars. I am not disagreeing with what is written about the Door View Cameras limited downward field-of-view, but I do have to add that ALL those reviewers are extremely NAIVE.The Door View Camera (and other Ring Video Doorbell products) are exactly what they say they are and do exactly what they say they can do in their name. After all, Ring didn’t name this product “Ring Package Monitoring Camera”. The premise of a video doorbell is to see people who come to your door and work as a two-way communication device to talk to them.So, let’s look at the Door View Camera objectively:1. Looking for a video doorbell you can install utilizing the peephole - check2. Looking for a device that lets you use the peephole but will also let you see what’s going on when you’re away - check3. Looking for a device that will alert you to motion in front of your door - check4. Looking for a device that will let you know when your package arrives - check5. Looking for a device that solely watches your packages - NOPE! Buy a separate camera and point it at your doormat.For a little substance, I’ve included a couple of photos showing the view of my Ring Video Doorbell 2. My Ring doorbell has a wedge kit pointing it down and a corner kit, pointing it slightly right. The screen grab shows the FedEx delivery person walking away after delivering my package, which she kindly placed on my doormat, but your can’t see the package. The RVD2 is installed 4 feet off the ground and even with the additional wedge & corner kits pointing the camera down and to the right, it doesn’t capture the ground in front of the door. If you want to see your package, get a camera to point at your package or your entryway (which you can clearly see in my second screenshot from my IP camera system) that shows exactly where the FedEx delivery person placed the package.>>>>> So the point of this review, don’t give a product 3 (or 1) stars because you hoped to purchase a package watching camera, it is not a fair assessment of the product’s capabilities! <<<<<
",0.576,electronics,"This camera was released two days ago, and I saw it in the morning order it right away because I was waiting for this.A little complain here it didn't email me when it was released in the morning, I saw it when I was browsing. Then later it email me around 4pm in the afternoon.(I subscribed to email me when release) still within one day acceptable delay.Now let me explain why I have been waiting for this. I already have some camera system installed I am just waiting for a doorbell one fit my needs, nest sounds promising but it will need to run new electric cable to work for my house (checked not compatible) And the existing ring support more voltage door bell cable also have battery version but I kind of don't like it installed on the side on my door. Because my front door is angled, so I was thinking we should be able do something through this peephole. That was before they announce this camera :) Then one day, they introduced this camera, then I have been waiting for it ever since. Not saying they steal my idea, it is very simple idea, they are smart enough to see the need and design it. Good job amazon ring team.I got it yesterday and installed everything works as I expected. And the view is awesome, the door view angle basically same as you see in the peephole a little bit wider angle. And all other function same as other ring, also the battery is inside makes more sense and looks not so big from the outside.I will keep updating if I notice any bugs, so far I am just happy with this design and perfect location to install.
",0.83482968876,electronics,"09/29/20019 EDIT:  This device and company is getting more and more frustrating every day.  For the last week, everytime I have an activation I have to log-in to their website, wade through their sales promos in order to see the most recent activation (occurring on both both my Android phone and my Android tablet).  The ability to directly go to Live View is gone!  I've tried uninstalling and re-installing the most current version of their app...no change.  Guess that it is time (again!) to contact their Help line...08/20/2019 EDIT:  Ring came out with an upgrade to their motion detection.  The new ""Advanced"" detection allows you to set three zones either on or off.  The bad part for many users is that the zones radiate outwards from the camera face: Left, Center and Right.  I prefer to know who / when someone is approaching from either side of my front door or when they are standing in front of the door.  What I need in ""Advanced"" motion detection is the ability to set ""dead"" zones for depth (further out from door so that passing vehicles and pedestrians  do not trigger alerts...NOT Left, Right or Center right in front of the camera.  The new motion detection also adds additional digital signal processing that substantially delays notification to the point where a package courier, sales person, etc is already leaving / gone by the time you are notified.My Knock Detection has not worked in a couple of weeks...not even with seriously hard raps to the door.  Time to check out their Warranty.07/25/2019 EDIT:  Pulled the battery at 30 days up-time (charge was at 43%) and replaced it with the spare.  I figure that I will change out the battery on the first of each month as part of my normal household maintenance.The most recent information I received from Ring is that the engineers are still working on the motion and knock issues.  Motion is dialed down so low that people at the front door do not always activate the sensor...but, large trucks (particularly light-colored trucks) continue to trigger random activations.The Live View feature continues to be randomly buggy and slow when you want to see who is at the front door...sometimes it loads quickly and other times it gives up trying to connect after a couple of minutes.The lag time before you can view an Event continues to take five minutes (or more) before you can retrieve and review the most recent Event from the Ring cloud.07/20/2019 EDIT:  Over the last week the device has become increasingly unstable.  The app frequently does not connect.  When trying to activate Live View, it will send a query to activate the device, proceed through an authentication process which includes sending credentials to authenticate the device with the app (this all takes from 45 seconds to several minutes) with the end result that the device cannot be connected at this time.  The wi-fi signal is good, battery is in the 40 - 50% range.The service rep is pleasant to e-mail or talk with...but, she cannot automagically correct or overwrite the technical issues (hardware, firmware and software) this device has.A friend who has numerous wired Ring products (and likes them) is interested in adding this device to his home...my recommendation to him was to wait until V.2 is out (and de-bugged) before investing in the Door View Cam.07/15/2019  EDIT:  Twenty-six days up..battery 57% (still in line for my original estimate of <60 days).Interesting note is that the advertising on Amazon's site now includes a disclaimer ""The placement of your peephole may prevent you from seeing items left at your door.""Gone is the ""up to 6 months battery life"" ad copy...after calling their Ring Team I was told that it is good for 500+/- activations on a charge.Ring Team member confirmed that Knock sensitivity is something the engineers are working on...my device continues to require a pain-inducing, knuckle-jarring hard knock almost on top of the device to register.  The product advertising image of a child knocking way down on the door doesn't work in my particular installation.Ring Team also confirmed that the engineers are working to implement Ring's Advanced Motion Detection into this product...no implementation date given.Ring did switch out my Chime Pro Extender for a simple Chime device...a handy addition to the system that works well.07/08/2019 EDIT:  Nineteen days up and down to 69% battery.  Still working with the motion sensitivity (this is ridiculous!)...currently the sensitivity is dialed so low that you have to be ""up front and center"" for detection.Knock detection is glitchy...requires a Custom setting of 9 (out of 10) to register a knock on my door.Fortunately the rest of my home is amenable to a wired camera installation...unfortunately the front door is not.06/24/2019 EDIT:  Battery life - it appears that my original estimate of up to 60 days may be optimistic....four days up and the battery is down by 10%...extrapolating this data leads to (roughly) 40 days maximum on a charge.  Delivery trucks, cars, joggers, children and dogs all serve to activate the motion detector eating up the battery (as well as any Live View events I initiate).  I had to turn the sensitivity down to where people have to be on the porch, at the door to activate the device...I was hoping for a bit more advance notification (apparently, the device does not support setting up separate motion exclusion zones).  Presumably, if the device is installed on an apartment door in a busy hallway the battery drain would, most likely,  be similar.The photographic quality could be better...images of people at the front door are not as crisp and sharp as the advertising leads you to believe...identifiable...not much more.Original Review:As other reviewers have pointed out...the bottom of the field is approximately 5 feet out from the vertical plane of the door...terrible for monitoring package delivery.  However, nice view of the sky and my porch ceiling.The documentation is shoddy.  Setting up the Knock feature appears easy...but where is the notification button and how do you customize the Knock notification?  Over the past two days I have set it up several times and it has yet to respond with the cute little dialogue box the set-up sequence shows.  You have to repeat the entire Knock set-up process just to change the sensitivity settings.  Loud vehicles passing by set off the device on the most sensitive setting while the medium setting sometimes fails to respond to a direct knock on the door.Do NOT waste your money on the Ring Chime Pro Extender.  The received signal from the Extender was -10db weaker than the original 2.4 signal from my router.  Better to purchase a full range AC 750 (or higher) Extender from one of the reputable wi-fi companies (I used an Amped Wireless AC1200 Extender from Costco).  Which brings me to one of my biggest gripes...this camera is only 2.4 Ghz, it does not have the 5.0 Ghz provision that most other Ring cameras have.  The additional speed and bandwidth of a 5 Ghz connection would definitely cut the lag and buffering time evident in the current system.Glad I purchased a spare battery.  It appears that the claimed 6-month battery life is only achievable in a laboratory setting.  Thirty to sixty days is looking more realistic for battery life.Be prepared to be inundated with marketing directed at you to purchase their Protect Plus Plan (before your system is even set-up they start pushing their most expensive monitoring plan).Summation: It works...BUT, there is a lot of room for improvement in the device and the app.  I do not appreciate being the beta tester for a supposedly finished, market-ready product.
",0.576,electronics,"Its ok.
",0.74861437176,electronics,"I've just received this a few days ago after waiting months for its release. Installation is straight forward, fits and looks great on the door. Removed my old Ring (Gen 1) from my account and added this one. All went smooth activating it on my iPhone and linking it to the Ring Chime, alexa and iPad.  I also use a mac computer which I have the Ring app installed and worked perfect with the old Ring. This camera will not show on my device list so I can't see recordings or view live from my mac. The only device that shows up is the Ring Chime. Thinking it was the app, I un-installed and re-installed with the same results. I went a step further and setup my old Ring as a second device and it shows up on my mac and can view that as I did before.  Called Ring support (whom are very nice) and they told me that there is a known technical issue with software or firmware causing this product not to work on mac or Windows 10 apps.  Really????  Also, this only works on 2.4GHz wi-fi. Being such a new product you would expect 5GHz connectivity.This product should have never been released until this major glitch got ironed out and tested!  I'm told I would receive an email within 24-48hrs of my call. Today is 24hrs so I expect a response tomorrow. I will update as soon as I hear from them.Camera and video are of awesome quality, super crisp images but with one other fault. This unit obviously has one mounting option and that is to replace your peep hole viewer and does what it's supposed to do but camera angle is to high to show bottom of door where most packages are left. I do have a side walk leading up to my door and can see someone walk up before they realize the Ring is on the door but I will be unable to monitor packages to make sure they are still there.  I hope thy can fix these issues with a firmware update instead of a V 2.0 camera. For a high end price of 200.00 all of this should have been thought of and tested before release. I will wait just before return period is up and if these issues are not fixed, it's going back.Conclusion: Great idea, great hardware, great support and does work as designed but with the above issue.I will update as soon as I hear from Ring.******Update******I have been contacted by a Ring representative and was told that the app for mac has not yet been updated and is pending as of now. They are working on it.During the first week, this device became unresponsive to all motion and doorbell button alerts. I had to reset the device twice to get it working again. Working fine now. Also, to get the knock sensor to work, I had to change the knock detection setting to high. Works now.As far as the camera angle is concerned by not being able to view your packages, I am amending my initial review by saying that this is a ""Door View Camera"" and is designed as such. It replaces your peep hole viewer and adds doorbell, motion alerts and video. If you need specific aim at your front porch area, I would suggest getting a Ring device that is designed to mount to your liking.I have updated to 4 stars based on the personal support I've received. Hope to update to five pending the mac app compatibility and stability of this device.
",0.76482957676,electronics,"UPDATE:Took one star off - the cover won't stay on and is always falling off when anyone closes the door, and the battery life is nowhere near 6 months - my guess is probably about 40 or 50 days tops - and our doorway is not at all busy======================What another review mentioned - the device works pretty much as described but the camera should really be aiming low to cover parcel placing positions instead it shows me the ceiling of my porch - what use is that? Also, the alexa connection to the device is SLOW - if you are hoping to get a snappy response from Alexa when you say ""show me the door camera"" you are out of luck, you'll be waiting 10 seconds - doesn't sound much but it's faster for me to answer the door. Also, the install needs a SINGLE video showing installation - it's not all that obvious.
",0.07583844776,electronics,"We live in a third floor apartment with a door facing an exterior breezeway and this camera was just what we needed for security. Our front door is the only entry or exit for our apartment so we now have a 30 second video record of every entry and exit plus anyone approaching or even walking past our door. The $3 per month fee is well worth the price. Video quality is great during the day or night (see photos), and we can view from our phones or on our TV with our Fire TV stick. It also sounds a chime on our Echo Dot when anyone rings the door bell or knocks on our door.
",0.576,electronics,"For a product to be on the market for just a short while, it seems to have a few too many complaints to have to not have a decent review period. I would like to respond to some of them. 1.The angle of view seems fine to me. I don't need to see the floor for a package delivery. When I get a package, I am usually home and pick it up right away. If I am gone, I don't need to see it anyway. 2. Motion sensativity can be adjusted low enough that I don't get alerts from the street. 3.I have a storm door in front of the camera and have no problem with viewing during the day, and by turning the night view off as directed the HD camera at night is a crisp black & white view. I have only one small complain not related to the function of the door bell. It deals with the time it takes to charge the battery pack. I bought a second battery pack. Problem solved.
",0.86185276577,electronics,"No more guessing and wasting shots. When people were over I'd have to take two pics one for us and one for them. Now I can make copies of the same pic as many as I want, film stock providing. No connection problems with the app (I use Android). In my case, I used my Canon Camera Connect App to import from the camera directly to the phone and printed it to the Instax Mini Link via bluetooth. Obviously you can use a cellphone pic or any picture for that matter. The collage print feature is another bonus vs. a proper Instax cam. Also, I was able to print in black and white regardless of the color film. Yeah it's 99 dollars, but with its ease of use and fun shots I can give to people... I'll find myself using it a lot more often. No regrets.

However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.

",0.05782234778,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.08309632578,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

",0.97169971578,electronics,"I had an 8 .9 (which was a wonderful tablet for its day).  Then I got a 7"" for my Mom.  Not so great, too small.  I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.  Those who don't would probably prefer other brands of tablets, because Amazon doesn't make it easy to access content that isn't Amazon.

In my review of yesterday (which is gone), I complained that Location Services would not kick in and Tech Support could not assist.  I primarily wanted the tablet to stream TV -- in my case Hulu.  Hulu would not stream due to lack of location and weather had me in Seattle when I am in Alabama.  I gave a One Star review and was deliberating what to do -- perhaps send back.  This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.  I returned home and it now works on my home network.  Not a very high tech or explainable solution -- but a resolution.

",0.84786665479,electronics,"I currently own the Netvue 720p HD IP camera (Purchased 2017) and the newer Netvue 1080p indoor security camera (Purchased 2019). I haven’t had any problems with either except once in a blue moon they may need to be power cycled. When I saw this 1080p pet camera with pan tilt zoom I decided to give it a try. Included in the box is the camera, a 6ft power cord, 5V 1A power adapter, drilling template, mounting bracket and the quick guide. Setup was simple and straight forward. Install the app on your phone, create an account and click to add device and follow the walk through. Note: This camera only operates under 2.4 GHz and will not work if your router only broadcasts on 5 GHz. I find that the iphone app works well without any major problems. It works well on wifi networks as well as cellular. Netvue is currently working on a desktop/computer application but currently there is not one available, so you can only view your cameras from your phone. I wouldn’t say the camera is small, although I find it is aesthetically pleasing and isn’t an eye sore if placed where it is easily seen. It is well built. Once added to netvue app all cameras connected to the app are displayed on the home screen. When viewing the camera video feed, you have the option to tilt/pan/zoom. In my experience pan and tilt have worked flawless, but it is worth noting that it cannot tilt down past looking straight ahead. This does limit how high you can set the camera if placing it on a shelf. You can also mount it on the wall with the included hardware which would increase viewing options.  It can tilt up 100 degrees and pan 360 degrees and is pretty much silent when turning. I mounted it on a wall in my children’s playroom and this allows for complete viewing of the playroom. The zoom function is digital zoom which distorts the picture when zooming, the camera lens itself does not zoom. Picture quality is clear, sound and the talk function are serviceable. Night vision is good on its own but can be pretty impressive if you add a small amount of light in the room. This may require trial and error to get the light in the right place where it doesn’t affect auto day/night function.  Netvue offers 24/7 cloud recording for $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year. You can also put in a SD card, which is what I did. It records fine and I haven’t noted a lot of false recordings. Honestly for the price point of this camera, I would say you would be hard pressed to find a better PTZ camera. I haven’t had any negative experiences with any of my netvue cameras and I am completely satisfied with my purchases. Would purchase from them again.Another note as this is PTZ if you use a power adapter that supplies less than 5V 1A most likely it’ll turn on and work until you go to use Pan or tilt at that time the camera may shut off due to requiring more power supplied.

She exhibited anxiety when we returned home after any length of time away and we wanted to know if she had been distressed all the time or only as soon as she heard the key in the door.Registering the device is a breeze so long as you have the 2.4ghz available. After several attempts to get connected and a lengthy on-line chat with Tech Support, we eventually had to call out internet provider to separate the 2.4 and 5.0 bands. As soon as this was done, all went well.We purchased a 128B Micro SD Card so that we did not have to pay for cloud storage. I was surprised that there is no way to stop the recording without taking out the card. Not a deal breaker though.We mounted the camera up high to avoid it getting knocked about. The sound and vision quality are OK, and there is great area coverage. However, it is disappointing that this camera does not appear to have the advertised zoom feature. There is a slight video delay and when moving the camera which is a little frustrating.On the whole, if you are prepared to overlook the minor frustrations, it is a good product for the price.Pup Update...We discovered that as soon as we leave, she plays with her stuffed treat and then goes to sleep and is absolutely fine until we get home!

",0.93724173380,electronics,"Original review (June 30, 2019)ORIGINAL REVIEW: June 30, 2019: 5/5 starsUPDATED review: July 3, 2019: 4/5 starsFor background information, I am a professor and a tech geek. I have used Amazon devices for around eight years now. I currently own three Kindle e-readers (Kindle Touch, Kindle Paperwhite 3rd generation, and Kindle 10). I also own four Amazon Fire tablets (2015 Fire 7 -5th generation, 2019 Fire 7 – 9th generation, 2017 Fire HD 8 - 7th generation and 2018 Fire HD 8 –8th generation) and 3 Echo devices (1st generation Echo, 2nd generation Echo Dot, and 3rd generation Echo Dot). Please note that I have traded-in some of the dated versions of the above-listed products to get upgraded versions (more on this under the “Saving Money on Purchases” section).This device - Amazon’s “All New” Echo Dot Kids Edition (2019 release) is essentially the same as the Echo Dot 3rd generation with the following exceptions: (1) fabric cover colors (Rainbow or Blue) are different; (2) the addition of a 1-year free subscription of FreeTime Unlimited (henceforth referred in this review to as FTU); and (3) a 2-year replacement warranty and service plan with no questions asked). This combination of quality and value are tough to beat, and the speaker does well overall. This is a comprehensive review, but for those looking for the bottom line, scroll down to the end of this review to see my thoughts on how to save money on purchasing the Echo Dot Kids Edition (henceforth referred to as EDKE3) and my final recommendations on this product.I have spent the past few days interacting with the EDKE3, using it, and reading other online reviews about this device to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of information provided in this review. As previously mentioned, I also own the “regular” Echo Dot that I have used for around 2 years now.- The Box (package): The Echo Dot Kids Edition (EDKE3) smart speaker, a quick-start guide, 15W wall adapter, and a USB cord (around 5.5 foot or 66 inches). The item arrived sealed and packaged well.- Availability (Color): Blue or Rainbow.-Set up: Plug in the device to receive prompts, and then connect to the Internet using the Alexa app (download the app to your phone/tablet), and you are ready to go by asking “Alexa” (Amazon’s virtual assistant) for specific requests.- Key things that have not changed from the prior Echo Dot 2nd generation Kids Edition(henceforth referred to as EDKE2):--- Alexa is the same, but also Alexa has several skills and is constantly being updated.--- Price remains the same (factoring out sales discounts)--- Voice shopping turned off for kids--- Filtering of songs with explicit lyrics- Summary of critical aspects that have changed in this version (Echo Dot 3rd generation Kids Edition vs. Echo Dot 2nd generation Kids Edition).--- An improved FreeTime Unlimited (FTU) Subscription and parental controls are being constantly updated.--- Larger speaker (1.6 inch vs. 1.1 inch), which makes a world of difference. Amazon makes the claim that the volume quality has improved by around 70%. I would say sound and volume quality has improved tremendously though it is not comparable to the Echo or Echo Plus. However, what more can one expect from a device the base Echo family device sold at an very affordable price?--- The EDKE3 has 4 microphones as compared to Echo Dot 2 (7 microphones), though I didn’t see any decline in microphone functionality with the reduced number of microphones.--- EDKE3 has two options for fabric colors (Blue or Rainbow) vs. EDKE2 (Black color with Blue, Red, or Green kid-friendly cases).--- Dimensions: EDKE3 [3.9” x 3.9” x 1.7” (99 mm x 99 mm x 43 mm)] vs. EDKE2 [1.5” x 3.5” x 3.5” (38 mm x 90 mm x 90 mm)]. The new device is a bit larger (looks inflated with rounded edges) on all fronts because of the better speaker and has a futuristic design--- Weight: EDKE [10.6 oz (300 grams)] vs. EDKE2 [6.7 oz. (191 grams)]. Again, the new device is a bit heavier because of the better speaker.- Technical specs and other details:--- Size: 3.9” x 3.9” x 1.7” (99 mm x 99 mm x 43 mm)--- Weight: 10.6 oz (300 grams)--- Warranty and Service: 2-year worry-free guarantee: If it breaks, return it, and Amazon will replace it for free. The value of this service cannot be overstated especially for a kid’s device.--- Dual-band Wi-Fi. Uses 802.11a/b/g/n/ac (2.4 and 5 GHz) networks. No support offered to connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) Wi-Fi networks. I was able to connect to the Wi-Fi network without any technical difficulties and I used the Alexa app installed on my phone to complete this connection process.--- Ports: 3.5 mm stereo jack and power port--- 4 Built-in microphones and integrated speaker (1.6 inch).--- Buttons: Mute button and two volume controls.--- 1-year subscription to FTU with automatic renewal at $2.99/month plus tax. Subscription can be canceled at any time by contacting Customer Service or visiting the Parent Dashboard. Important- one FTU subscription can be used across multiple Amazon devices (more on this topic later).*** Please note that this product is only for Ages 3 and up as there is a choking hazard with small parts.Comparison between Echo Dot Kids Edition (3rd generation) and Echo Dot 3rd generation.--- Regular Price: EDKE3 ($69.99 + tax) vs. Echo Dot ($49.99 + tax).--- Most common sale price: Echo Dot Kids Edition ($49.99 + tax) vs. Echo Dot ($29.99 + tax).--- FTU: EDKE3 (1-year free subscription after which it will be $2.99/month + tax) vs. Echo Dot (sold separately at $2.99/month + tax).--- Warranty and Service: EDKE3 (2-year worry free guarantee and replacement – no questions asked) vs. Echo Dot (90-day limited warranty).--- Colors: EDKE3 (Blue or Rainbow) vs. Echo Dot (Charcoal, Heather Grey, or Sandstone).- Some limitations (to be expected because of this device being sold at a bargain price and also being the base model of the Echo series):--- The speaker is not as good as compared to the Echo or Echo Plus--- FreeTime and FTU are not without flaws (more on this later).--- No audio cable included.- Some useful features on Echo devices (not a comprehensive list).--- Accessibility: “The Alexa app and Alexa-enabled products include several features for customers with accessibility needs related to vision, hearing, mobility, and speech.”--- Bluetooth: “Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) support for audio streaming from your mobile device to Echo Dot or from Echo Dot to your Bluetooth speaker. Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) for voice control of connected mobile devices. Hands-free voice control is not supported for Mac OS X devices.” However, please note that Bluetooth requiring pin codes are not supported.- FreeTime vs. FreeTime Unlimited (FTU):---- Please note that FreeTime is automatically enabled on this device since it is a kid-friendly device.--- Enabling Amazon FreeTime in the Alexa app can make any Echo Device kid-friendly. This enables parents to “automatically filter explicit songs, add approved contacts, set time limits, or review activity with easy-to-use parental controls in the Amazon Parent Dashboard.” FreeTime is FREE (no payment).--- Whereas with an Amazon FTU subscription (starting at $2.99/month after a free one year subscription), kids can access “over 1,000 Audible books, premium kids skills from brands like Disney and Nickelodeon, ad-free radio stations and playlists, and more.” Several more features are available on FTU when Amazon tablets are used as compared to the Echo device.-FTU: Many of these features listed below will NOT work without explicit parental permission and when FTU is enabled (more on this later). However, if you want to use the device as a regular speaker then you can disable the FTU option--- Customers can make purchases from their Amazon account--- Customers can make shopping lists, set alarms or reminders, create lists, play jokes or games, ask Alexa about the news (by choosing respective stations on Alexa app), play audible books, podcasts, get weather updates, ask Alexa to share your daily schedule, ask Alexa for trivia, traffic updates, personal growth tips, hands free calling, sports updates, etc. to name a few.---  The “Drop In” feature on Alexa functions as a two-way intercom between any 2 Echo devices. Additionally, customers can use Announcements as a one-way intercom to other household devices. This can be done by asking Alexa to “Drop In” on Kitchen, Kid’s bedroom, Living Room (depending on how you have named your Echo devices), etc.  Children also have the option to call a list of pre-approved family and friends. Family members do not need to accept Drop Ins (announcements) as compared to a hands-free call that needs to be accepted (similar to a traditional phone call, people can reject the call). Basically, the Drop In feature works in your house while the hands-free call feature (calls require that you input the contact name and phone number by letting the Alexa app access this information) is making a physical call to either someone in your home or somewhere else using the Echo device. Calls can be made to the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Calling family members has been amazing. The noise-canceling set-up works really well and conversations are crisp and clear. Additionally, the microphones are definitely on par or better than prior version.--- You can pair 2 Echo Dots for better sound and volume quality. However, my recommendation would be to get an EDKE3 and a “regular” Echo Dot (cheaper) if you wish to provide your child with this option. However, there is not a substantial increase in quality.--- Music streaming is available.--- Voice control is available. This means you can purchase smart home devices that are compatible with Alexa and use them to turn on/off lights, adjust thermostats, lock doors, etc.** As mentioned, parental controls can be used to limit or block many of the above-listed features.Amazon FTU Unlimited (Echo Dot or Echo Dot Kids Edition)--- Any Amazon Echo Device (even if it is not specifically a Kids edition) can have the FreeTime skill enabled (you do not need subscription for turning on FreeTime) and can access FTU (if subscription has been purchased). This can be done by opening the Alexa app -> selecting “devices” -> selecting “All Devices”-> selecting your respective device -> then scroll down in your device options and select FreeTime -> Then select the “enabled/disabled” option. This device can then be used as a dedicated child’s device whenever FTU is needed.--- As previously mentioned, FTU can be canceled at any time by visiting the Amazon Parent Dashboard or contacting Amazon customer service.--- As previously mentioned, FTU gives access to over “1,000 Audible books, thousands of songs, plus favorite games and skills among other things on Echo Devices.” (Many more skills and options for FTU are available on the tablet, more on this in the next section).--- This device provides an amazing alternative for parents who are concerned about giving their child too much screen time yet want them to learn through auditory methods. For instance, Alexa can also read bedtime stories to kids and engage kids in conversation (though nothing functions as well as interaction with adults who can engage kids in back and forth conversation which is critical to their brain development). Kids also need to hear and see interactions (facial expressions, tone, etc.). However, on those unusual days when you are tired and worn out, this would be a good supplement.- FTU applied to Fire Tablet or Fire Tablet Kids Edition (more on the rationale for this later)---  FTU can work with your Amazon tablets – Fire tablet or Fire Kids Edition). I am mentioning this as an option because in my opinion the best way to maximize use of the FTU subscription is to get both the Fire tablet Kids Edition and the Echo Dot KE (more on this later in the “Saving Money on purchases section”).--- FTU is a subscription that offers over “20,000 books, movies, TV shows, apps and games for kids 3-12. Age Filters ensure kids see age-appropriate content. Parents can add content to kids' profiles to give them more access to apps and games.” “In FTU, kids do not have access to social media or Alexa. In-app purchases require parent approval. Parents can exit FTU using a passcode.” Another unique feature is Amazon’s FTU is available in Spanish for several apps! Hopefully, there will be even more language options in the future to help bilingual or multilingual families and also to help those who wish to learn additional languages.--- Parents also have the option “to set educational goals and curfews, and manage content for up to 4 child profiles with easy-to-use parental controls.”--- Generally speaking - FTU offers an unbeatable value – I mean where else on earth can you get kid-friendly and generally holistic content for $2.99/month (after the 1-year subscription expires). Additionally, kids can’t make any additional purchases without parental authorization so it protects parents from liabilities.*FTU has several nifty features that I cannot cover because of space limitations but it is pretty intuitive and outstanding. Amazon has done an outstanding job in this process. Parents have a lot of flexibility in choosing and curating content for children, permitting downloads, and even setting the tablet to turn-off after a preset amount of use or at a set time and turn on at a set time. This is a great feature, so you don’t have to constantly follow your kid saying – “you have 5 more minutes before to turn the tablet off.” The automatic turn-off absolves parents from this responsibility, avoids a potential meltdown, and teaches kids to be time conscious.  Additionally, kids can also be tasked with completing some educational apps/tasks before playing a game, etc. This is a nifty feature that helps build self-discipline and establish tangible expectations.-Some Usage Tips (Amazon’s review space limitations prevent me from putting any more):--- Changing Device Name: Please note that the device name can be changed from something generic to something specific. This is especially helpful if you own multiple Echo devices and was automatically assigned a generic device name (like “Echo Dot”) and has no clue which device is which on the Amazon Alexa app. This can be done by opening the Alexa app -> selecting “devices” -> selecting “All Devices”-> selecting “your respective device” -> then scroll down in your device options and select “Edit Name” -> Then you can change it to whatever you choose. Personally, I have named devices either based on user, model and/or location at home.--- Changing Wake Word: Please note that the “wake word” can be changed from Alexa to something else and can be device specific. This especially applies if you have multiple devices close to each other. This can be done by opening the Alexa app -> selecting “devices” -> selecting “All Devices”-> selecting “your respective device” -> then scroll down in your device options and select “Wake Word” -> Then you can change it to “Amazon” or “Echo” or “Computer” (three options currently available).--- Devices can be registered using the same methods listed above and getting to the Device specific page. This applies especially if you are gifting the device to another individual or are reselling it.- Saving money on purchases--- If you are considering buying the EDKE3, now is the time to get it. The FTU subscription alone will cost consumers around $36 + tax per year. Additionally, having 2-year warranty and service (with no questions asked) is an outstanding deal for a kid’s device. The regular Echo Dot usually goes on sale for $29.99 and this device is just 20 dollars more for the all above perks.--- FTU can work with tablets - Fire or Fire Kids Edition. So, the best way to maximize your FTU subscription investment is to get an Amazon tablet in addition to Echo Dot Kids edition because you can utilize FTU across multiple devices (one subscription works for multiple devices).--- My recommendation would be to preorder this item now. If you don’t get a chance to do so, then you can purchase this item during a sale event (for instance, Amazon Prime day is in mid-July).--- Also, another option is for customers to get the Fire Kids Edition tablet with 2-year warranty and service and includes a free 1-year subscription of FTU. Then get the regular Echo Dot on sale (you can get it for as low as $29.99 during Prime Day/Thanksgiving, etc.). The customer can then use the free 1- year subscription on the tablet and convert their “regular” Echo Device into a kid-friendly device. I recommend this option because kids are more likely to damage the Fire Tablet Kids Edition (moves around) than this Echo device (placed in one location). The customer can get the tablet on sale, and then stack the trade-in price and the 25% discount previously mentioned to get the EDKE3. However, one thing to keep in mind is that Amazon might decide to remove the trade-in gift card and 25% discount at any point. The above method can be used to purchase the “regular” Echo Dot.--- Occasionally, Amazon also offers discounts for a bundle sale on products (get 2 or 3 items for a substantial discount).--- Amazon recently offered a bundle sale to purchase both the Fire Kids Edition Tablet (henceforth kids edition is referred to as KE) and Echo Dot Kids Edition (colors can be customized for both devices) for a substantial discount. Fire 7 KE + Echo Dot KE: $129.98; Fire 8 HD KE + Echo Dot KE: $139.98; and Fire 10 HD KE + Echo Dot KE: $199.98. I recommend the Fire 8 HD KE + Echo Dot KE for $139.98 (these items are offered at a substantial discount of $60) because it is the mid-tier model. My reasons are several and include: the 8 inch screen (as compared to 7 inches), higher resolution (189 PPI vs. 171 PPI), increased RAM (1.5 GB vs. 1 GB), better battery life (10 hours vs. 7 hours), and Dolby Atmos, dual stereo speakers as compared to the mono-speaker. Besides, the Fire 8 Kids Edition has more reviews, a recent release, and a well-rated product when compared to Fire 7 Kids Edition. This bundle pricing is hard to beat and I strongly encourage customers to make use of this opportunity.- Conclusion: 5/5 starsTo sum up my review, this is the basic Echo Dot Kids Edition tablet. No bells and whistles, but it does the job. It works really well in a small room, plus the sound and volume quality is good for young kids. Updates worth noting in this version include better speaker, microphone, improved FTU options, and new color options (Rainbow or Blue). The bottom line is that if you are looking to get a super affordable Kids speaker that is well rated, small, lightweight, has an outstanding warranty and service (2-year replacement –no questions asked), and has FTU (several educational apps) then this device is the way to go.Update # 1: Privacy and Protection: 4/5 starsAmazon is currently involved in one federal lawsuit alleging that Alexa violated privacy laws in 8 states… “by making permanent recording of children’s voices without their consent”. The last thing I want is my child’s voice recording floating across the globe where Amazon analyzes it. So, I am docking a star because the lawsuit was permitted to move forward. I might add or delete stars pending the final outcome.Please also note that several resources were used in the compilation of this review, but most of this review was based on my personal testing of the product. Occasionally, I have repeated key concepts for new customers.Whenever I make any purchase, I try to do a thorough, honest, and accurate job with the review. I always post future updates and corrections based on new information if deemed necessary. Additionally, I always include photos of products to verify that I purchased this product and to back up appropriate claims.
",0.580,electronics,"Very disappointed. The only thing that’s kids friendly is that it keeps the music clean and can read them kids stories. You cannot set up voice recognition on a kids profile. You can not set up a calendar in a kids profile. You cannot make a morning/night routine for your child that plays over the Alexa. You have to disable the Free Time to do all of those things which is not kid user friendly, it’s basically like having another Alexa for yourself not for your kid to be able to use. I thought we would be able to set this up for HER morning routine, for HER daily calendar, for HER voice recognition. Very poorly thought out.
",0.17567190580,electronics,"Not worth the extra cost over the regular DOT.  Can always disable explicit music in spotify or app directly.  No need to pay 2x and a monthly fee to access content that is delivered free over YouTube or other online services.
",0.11337760180,electronics,"We have a few Echo devices in our home. My daughter loves to use them for music, books, random kid questions, and what not. I got her this second generation  kids edition Echo Dot in the rainbow.We have had our kids Dot for about a week now. My kid was so excited when she saw the bright rainbow stripes!I debated if it was worth it to get a kids edition vs. The regular echo dot since the kids version was a bit more. I am glad I went with the kids version. You get a year of Amazon FreeTime unlimited. FreeTime has kid friendly music, audio books, and additional skills kids can access. You set up a profile for your child in FreeTime and echo will even say the child's name at certain times in their interactions. With parental controls you can filter explicit music, set time limits, and check their activity history. You can manage who they can call and you can select which smart home devices they can control from their Echo Dot.This is exactly what I would expect from a kids edition Amazon product. There are easy to use parental controls that make me confident I can allow my daughter to use it without worry.I say it's definitely worth what I paid for it. The little bit extra you pay is for the FreeTime Unlimited; I didn't notice any other differences between the regular and kid version. However, the FreeTime unlimited is what makes this more fun for kids. Even after the year is over I'll still pay the $2.99/month to keep the service.

",0.9899411880,electronics,"Picture this, you're scouring Prime Day deals looking for a good solution to an ongoing problem in your house and come across the Echo Kid's Edition. You think it would be perfect for what you need, a device with built in parental controls that can work as a remote for your child so he can ask age appropriate questions, dance to Kid's Bop songs, and control his TV without a remote that will go disappearing every three seconds because he's young and forgetful.I ordered this Echo Dot Kids Edition, as I also recently purchased an Insignia Fire TV edition for my son and wanted him to be able to utilize the voice control for his TV. A function that every other Echo device in my house will do. After wasting about an hour of my time playing around with the settings thinking I was crazy I decided to try Amazon's product support number. It couldn't just be me, the TV was able to be turned on and off with the Kids Edition Echo, but it was not able to access any of the apps (Netflix, PBS Kids, and Nick Jr.). I spent roughly an hour on the phone with the first representative attempting to do all the same things I did on my own prior. As we could not come up with a solution, I was told the issue would be escalated to another department and I would receive a call back in an hour.Needless to say, I never received that call.  I tried back later in the evening and was disconnected on 2 separate occasions after waiting on hold for a representative. When I was able to get a representative on the phone without being disconnected, I was informed that my complaint had in fact, NOT be escalated. In fact, it was never even documented that I called.  After an extended discussion, I was told that the only way I can enable a video skill on the kids edition, is to switch profiles from my son's to mine. Doing this would essentially be eliminating the kids unlimited and parental controls and turning it into an ordinary dot. Which had I known, I could have bought the regular Echo Dot for less than half of what I paid for the Kid's Edition.  At this point, I had been on the phone for more than 2 hours total with Amazon support, not to mention the time I wasted troubleshooting on my own. All of this was only to find out that the device is not capable of doing the one thing I bought it for.To add insult to injury, when the issue was finally escalated to a supervisor I was told that the only way to allow me to purchase a regular Echo at the Prime Day price (which is when I purchased the Kid's Edition) was to REFUND A DIFFERENT ORDER to create a credit on my account. Not that Amazon would give a credit for the time, aggravation, and false advertising leading me to purchase the kids edition for nearly $50 versus the $20 standard Echo. So in order to ""make my situation better"" they would refund a previous purchase of their choosing, to create the credit on my account. Both my wife and myself, having worked customer service in prior jobs, saw red flags with this option. What if the item they ""refund"" needs to be returned for any reason? It would already show as refunded and we would be stuck with no options. We are returning this waste of money Kids Edition, and seriously considering getting rid of our Prime Membership, Free Time accounts for our kids, and discontinuing use of Amazon products going forward. We've heard some great things about the Google Home and may very well make the switch due to the lack of service that Amazon's customer service was willing to offer, as well as their poor advertising. Nowhere did they mention that this particular Echo device would be prohibited from accessing video capabilities like Netflix (which has parental controls connected to it) or Prime Video (also with parental controls through the app).  If you have any desire to utilize this particular Echo in a similar fashion, save yourself the time and get a regular Echo or try a Google product. Customer Service will NOT be willing to help you.
",0.16447225280,electronics,"Are you thinking of getting this so your kids can use voice control for their fire tv? Well don’t because after an hour on the phone with people I will loosely call tech support having me linking and unlinking, enabling this and disabling that. Someone finally told me that some idiot at amazon decided that with “Freetime” enabled (the only thing that makes this echo dot a “Kid’s Edition”), kids can’t use voice commands to control their tv which is the whole reason I got this crap. Amazon should have put that in the tech specs: Caution, this echo dot kids edition doesnt work with fire tv voice controls. I have to send the fire stick back because that is the only reason I got it. I should never have switched. So long Alexa, Google home here we come!
",0.22196155881,electronics,"I see so many people on here who are technology ""experts""  stating how its slow and it sucks and its awful and its build quality is awful.With due respect its build quality is in line with paying $150 bucks for a 10.1"" tablet.  Yes its plastic, yes its screen is only 1900x1200, yes its Media Tek processor is not the top processor available today, yes it ONLY has 2GB of ram.  However your stupid if you feel like this is a letdown, after all most of this information can be found right on the page to purchase the tablet.Here is the deal with this tablet.- I bought it to watch and consume Prime video, Netflix video, (maybe someday put the google store on it for youtube (but even now i can go to youtube on the silk browser and it works perfectly fine)- I play light games, but its able to play what I play without problem.- I do not feel i need to baby this tablet because I only paid 180 bucks for it (64GB not 32) in fact i got two HD8's and this HD10 for me for less than my wife's IPAD.  So if they break it.. im not out 300 bucks-Being a network engineer this is my get away from computers without getting away.  I have zero productivity apps on it (which i like) I have zero communication apps on it (which I like), This tablet for me is a way to get away from life.  I have a phone for talking, and work, and teams, and slack.Dont kid yourself, this is not a high end tablet.  These one star reviews needs to take a better look at themselves and understand  you get what you pay for.  And for me, this absoutley works for what i need it to do.  And i dont feel like crap if i drop it and break it.why not five star.  Speakers are not great, again get what you pay for... which to me is not a big deal... i would of only taken a half a star off for them if I could.
",0.03439861581,electronics,"Why was my initial review removed?I was about the update my previous 5-star good review with the following only to find my video + photo review was removed!However I discovered that there's around 10% battery drain daily, probably due to the ads on lock screen, even when airplane mode is turned on (wifi off)!I lose almost 70% to 80% charge in about a week!I am aware there's an option to pay to get rid of the ads,but the lock screen ads even consumes so much power on standby just doesn't make any sense to me.I don't mind seeing the ads.

",0.05782234781,electronics,"NOV 16, 2019 - If I could, I'd drop this to 2.5 stars. Why? Because it lost all my collections today.NOV. 6, 2019 - I've now spent about a week with the new HD 10. In this cut, I've done some rearranging to, I hope, make the review more useful.Also, I want to say that I agree with other reviewers, like Cody Schiemann, who assert that it is unfair to compare a $200 tablet to, say, a $1k Apple iPad. That's absolutely true. I want to emphasize that I do notexpect Amazon to sell for $200 a device that matches both the hardware and software sophistication of an Apple iPad.  But Amazon is no longer a neophyte player in this market. The problems with its software have now existed for several generations and can't be justified on the basis of cost savings. These flaws are not product ""killers"", but $200 is $200, and buyers should know what they can and cannot expect for that money.NOV. 1, 2019 - I plan on a ""Third Cut"" in the next few days after I've had a chance to more carefully compare the 2017 and 2019 HD-10s (beyond the technical specs which are available from Amazon). Please check back if you're still trying to make a decision about this model.Oct. 31, 2019 - NOTE: If you read my ""First Cut"" written about 3 hours after I received the 2019 model on Oct. 30, 2019, I apologize - a bit. I wanted 3 things from the 2019 model: performance, stability, and a better way to handle my collections of applications and games (around 300 in 30 or so collections). The still brain-dead ""application collection"" software design simply infuriated me.I'm going to assume there are several different kinds of buyers for this Amazon tablet and will try to organize this review so that you can easily identify the sections that pertain to you:1. Newbie - have an Android smartphone or tablet but have never owned an Amazon tablet (or have never had any kind of ""smart""  portable device).2. Current owner of a non-Amazon tablet.3. Current owner of one of Amazon's smaller tablets.3. Currently own the HDX or 2017 HD-10 and are trying to decide if this is an upgrade.4. Own only Apple devices. (If you fall into this category, I can pretty much guarantee that none of Amazon's current tablets will meet your standards.)Also: I bought the 64GB model without special offers in Black.BACKGROUND:I owned 5 Fire tablets: the original 7"", the 2012 8.9"", the 2013 7"" HDX and the 2014 8.5"" HDX and the Fire HD 10 (2017 model). As I discussed in my review of the 2017 Fire HD 10 (https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GZTHJ4SWER0C/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MYXPMVK), I bought it mainly out of desperation because the battery in my beloved HDX was on its last legs.HDX vs. HDThe 2019 HD-10 is still not an HDX, and I admit to being baffled by Amazon's decision-making. I understand its desire to concentrate on the low-end market, to see its devices as delivery mechanisms for its products. But the 8.5"" HDX was produced in 2014, 5 years ago. I don't work in the technology sector so I don't have any facts about production costs, but I find it hard to believe that Amazon couldn't produce an HDX quality tablet without busting the buyer's budget. Why not go back to the more comfortable 8.5"" form factor (saving materials) and increase the screen resolution back to the HDX's 2560 x 1600?MY HD-10 (2017) EXPERIENCESo why did I order the 2019 model? Well, just as I felt I had no choice in 2017, I felt I had no choice but to try the presumably improved 2019 model. During the past year, I've pretty much stopped using the 2017 Fire HD-10. It was too slow, too erratic, the software too clunky. Apps would constantly disappear from my collections, and even with the help of a spreadsheet I built, recreating them took 2-3 hours (depending on how badly Amazon had messed things up). Books would fail to download. When I finally got one downloaded and started reading, I'd often get kicked back to the Library screen. So, for most of the past year, I have been relying almost completely on a Samsung Galaxy S8+ smartphone. It's fast, I can switch quickly and reliably between apps, and it even has a split screen (although its usefulness on such a small device is questionable).Still some things work better on a larger platform: reading books and PDFs, watching videos. So, I took the plunge and ordered the 2019 model, not without a lot of fear that I would be wasting my money.First Impression: Major, huge disappointment. Yes, it seems to be faster than the 2017 model but the OS has barely changed at all and not noticeably for the better.PACKAGINGThe tablet comes in a very simple box for which I am grateful. For too many years, Amazon has shipped its electronic products in extremely attractive, often difficult-to-open boxes. They looked too nice to toss in the trash but were so designed that they were pretty much impossible to ""re-purpose"".HARDWAREIt's a $150 - $200 device. Don't expect iPAD quality. Does it matter to me? No. It looks and feels fine and I always put my tablets (and smartphone) in cases, so ""looks"" don't matter to me.SIZEI still prefer the 8.5"" form factor: it's large enough for videos and reading and small enough to fit comfortably easily into briefcases, bookbags, or larger purses. But this is definitely a matter of personal preference.CAMERASThese are identical to those in the 2017 model, and, as I argued in my review of the 2017 model, I don't much care about the fact that they are not ""top-of-the-line"". Smartphones these days are practically being sold on the basis of their cameras, and they are simply easier to use than a 10-inch tablet. (To control, look for 3 itsy bitsy dots on lower right of the camera screen.)AUDIOI'm not an audiophile. I listen mainly to the BBC and podcasts. When I do listen to music installed on the tablet, I use headphones or connect to a Bose Bluetooth speaker. From my perspective, this is more than adequate.VIDEOThese tablets are designed to deliver video. You'd have to pay a lot to do better than this HD-10.MICRO-SD CARDI've not installed a microSD card, so I can't evaluate its usefulness. I will say that owners of the 2017 HD-10 spent pretty much the first year (at which point I stopped checking) complaining about a wide range of problems with the SD card.ANDROID vs. AMAZON INTERFACEAndroid purists consider Samsung's ""skin"" to be ""unacceptable"" for reasons I don't understand. Having used Amazon tablets for years and the Samsung Galazy S8+ for about two years, I am agnostic about the interfaces.Samsung gives me a lot of flexibility, which I like. But there's something to be said for the major categories (For You, Home, Books, Games & Apps, Shop, Music, Audible, Newsstand, etc.) that adorn Amazon tablets. They are logical groupings, albeit with limited customization within the groupings.If you've never owned a smartphone or tablet, you should find the interface friendly and useful. If you own an Android smartphone or tablet, well, you may or may not like Amazon's interface. And if this will be your umpteenth Amazon tablet, the interface will be very familiar.SETUPMy DSL is 50Mbps so your experience may differ timewise. Also, I ordered it registered to my account and, as mentioned above, I'm a longtime owner so Amazon ""knows"" me.Startup was fast.It asked me to choose my language, ""registered account"", installed updates (a process that took only a second), greeted me, connected to my Wi-Fi.Then it gave me the option to ""restore"" from my Fire (apps and games, Fire settings, Wi-Fi, email, search history). It listed one of my earliest HD tablets (the 7-inch HDX) but gave the option to show others. It came up with my 8.5-inch HDX and my 2017 HD10 - which is the one I accepted (although I was a bit worried that it showed a backup date of Oct. 8, 2019).Note: I did check my 2017 model to make sure that everything looked OK, especially that all of my apps and games were in their assigned collections on the Home screen.Setup went through several stages very quickly: restoring, signing into the account, updating to the latest software, Fire settings, etc. Then, and this is where catastrophe struck, it started to download my apps. The screen went blank. I thought perhaps it had done a hard shutdown and would restart shortly. But after about 5 minutes, the screen was still blank.I pressed the Start button and got a message that I needed Wi-Fi which was rather odd since the Wi-Fi symbol was on and when I checked that setting it was, indeed, connected.Set up continued but showed an erratic downloading time, ranging from around 40 minutes to 5 minutes to various numbers in-between. Finally, it said ""restoring error"" and told me to contact Amazon service at www.amazon.com/devicesupport or select ""do not restore"".Well I definitely wanted a restore from the cloud and I figured device support would be essentially useless. (Amazon had great customer service for its tablets during the first 4 or 5 years but, well, not so much anymore.)So, I decided to turn the tablet off, turn it back on and hope for the best.MOVING FROM ONE FIRE TO ANOTHERAmazon has never handled tablet synching well. I've spent way too much time with each new tablet bringing it ""up-do-date"". This was, however, my very worst experience.  None of my application collections were downloaded. Neither my Silk history nor bookmarks came through. All that showed up on the Home screen were Amazon apps.I treated the lack of application/game collections as an opportunity to discover if Amazon had finally updated its software. No such luck. The only way to create collections and add to them is by dragging and dropping, and it's an infuriating process due to a user interface whose creator should be sent to Purgatory. I had to download each app from the Games & Apps Library, then drag and drop to create the collections. You can't open a collection, expect a link to applications where you can click and add multiple collections. Not only has this functionality existed in the Books Library for years, but I'm pretty sure it exists on even the cheapest Android smartphone. Since I'm sure that every programmer who works for Amazon owns a smartphone of one kind or another, it's not as if I'm asking the company to invent a new technology.It took me close to 3 hours to recreate my collections (using the spreadsheet I built more than a year ago to deal with the 2017 model's erratic destruction of my collections). Beyond infuriating, especially since collection management was one of my main reasons for wanting a new tablet.(If you don't own hundreds of apps/games sorted into multiple collections, this probably won't be a problem for you. But for me it is a major disappointment.)WORSE: As of Nov. 16, 2019 all my collections are lost. Back to square one. Unacceptable.Games: a warning. If you play games like Candy Crush that allow you to create cloud accounts, your progress will, of course, transfer to the new tablet. However, King stores all the power-ups (bought or won) on the local device and those do not get transferred. This isn't an Amazon issue. Just King's way of trying to get more money from you. (I suspect this is true of other game developers as well.)SETTINGSGetting to the settings is not intuitive. There's no icon at the top of the Home screen. You must pull down, kind of ""hard"", to reach the settings icon. I have no idea what possessed Amazon to make this change to the UI.Amazon has made a number of esthetic changes to the settings, and seems to be offering more control over privacy and security.I was rather upset to discover that there was no longer an ""allow application installations from unknown sources"" generic option.  Instead, Amazon listed several apps, including Silk, with the option to accept (the default being not to) application installation from those sources.  Using Silk, I downloaded a 3rd party market application (to download apps not in Amazon's store). That went fine. Then from that marketplace I downloaded another application. At this point, Amazon asked if I wanted to accept application downloads from that source. I said yes.  In short, instead of a generic ""OK, you can do this"", Amazon is requiring that you specifically authorize any application that wants to download something. This is smart.PERFORMANCE & STABILITYThe 2019 HD-10 is the fastest tablet available from Amazon. It is also way more stable (so far) than my 2017 HD-10. None of my collections have disappeared. I've been able to move from one application to another (reading a book, surfing the web, checking Twitter or email) quickly and easily. Instead of using Twitter's built-in browser (as I've done for years because it was faster than using Silk), I made Silk the Twitter browser and noticed absolutely no difference in performance.The one quirk: the screen periodically ""blinks out"". I've changed the display timeout to 30 minutes, but that hasn't fixed the problem. When it occurs, I must press the Start button. I haven't yet been able to figure out when/why this is happening.GAME/APP STORES: APPLE, AMAZON, GOOGLEI honestly don't care about the relative number of games or apps available in each of these stores. 10,000? 20,000? Really, who would want to look through all of them? I own around 300 and, to be perfectly honest, got most of them with my first few generations of Fire tablets when Amazon was offering a free app every day.It should be obvious, but I will say it: you cannot install apps/games from Apple.As for the Amazon and Google stores: yes, Google has more apps/games. If you already own an Android smartphone or tablet, you're likely to find that some of the apps/games you use are not available from Amazon.What to do?Well, first of all, Amazon's own apps (Kindle, Audible, Alexa, etc.) are available in both stores (based on my smartphone experience). BUT, whether you are using an Android smartphone or an Amazon tablet, they may not play well together. Those of us who installed the Google Play Store on the 2017 HD-10 quickly ran into a problem with the Kindle app. The one from the Google Play Store didn't remember anything: it kept greeting us as if we were just starting out. The only ""fix"" was to turn off automatic updating in the Google Play Store and avoid updating Amazon apps from that store. On my Galaxy S8+, I've also run into intermittent problems with Amazon apps (especially the Kindle) downloaded from Google's store vs. from Amazon's.In short, with respect to the Amazon apps, be very careful to only download/update them from the Amazon store. I suppose this is the price we must pay for competition, but it is annoying and rather ridiculous since, I assume, Amazon is responsible for the Amazon apps in Google's Play Store.NON-AMAZON APPSThere are basically two ways to download apps that are not available in the Amazon app store. You can download the .apk files from several different sources (Google it) or you can install the Google Play Store.I've not tried the latter yet in part because I suspect some of my problems with the 2017 HD-10 may have been related to installing the Google Play Store since it is not a single app but a complete sub-system.OTOH, if an application or game you use depends on Google's play services, you pretty much have only two choices: install the Play Store or resign yourself to depending on your Android smartphone for those applications and games.I wrote about the pros and cons on December 10, 2017 in Amazon's digital and device forum. Specifics may have changed, but I think it still describes the basic issues fairly well. Title: Sideloading Apps and the Google Play Store: Should You or Shouldn't You? (https://www.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tablets/466696-sideloading-apps-and-the-google-play-store-should)Note: if you downloaded apps or games from non-Amazon sources to an existing Amazon table, you must download them again. They do not get backed up.SILK - AMAZON'S BROWSERAmazon's first tablet (2011) was panned by almost every techie and possibly nothing got dinged more than Silk. Yes, it was Amazon's first browser, but it wasn't as if web browsers were new in 2011. Silk has grown up and is an acceptable browser if you don't want to download Chrome or Firefox.  BUT, you can't sync Silk across tablets. Think about that for a moment. It is Amazon's own browser, designed solely for use in its tablets. Amazon provides cloud services around the world. You can install Chrome or Firefox on your desktop, your laptop, your smartphone and even on an Amazon tablet and sync your bookmarks and history. But you cannot do this with Silk.DOCUMENTSI won't go into the entire sordid history around Amazon's ""docs"", how it dumped non-Amazon ebooks into docs rather than the Books library, for example. What I will say is that you should plan on backing up to a source you control any documents you create or edit on your tablet because they won't show up on the next tablet you buy. And, believe me, finding them on your old tablet so you can transfer them to your new tablet is .... very annoying and time-consuming.NON-AMAZON E-BOOKSAmazon doesn't want you to get e-books from other sources. It doesn't even want you to get Kindle e-books from other sources.  Several years ago, it created a proprietary format so that programs such as Calibre (an ebook management system) couldn't even index them.So, what to do? If you use ""send-to-kindle"", well, don't open up the Files folder and look for them. They won't be there. You must use the Amazon ""Doc"" app (long since banished from the top row to a tiny little icon).What about other kinds of e-books?  I've gotten books from several different sources, all of which have informed me that their books are not compatible with Amazon tablets (even if they are, theoretically, ""Kindles""). So I have installed the Bluefire Reader, BookFunnel and Moon+ Reader. But of course the books I downloaded to those apps didn't get backed up by Amazon. So now I must figure out where they are stored on my old Fire, and how and if I can get them on to my new Fire.NON-AMAZON MUSIC, PHOTOS AND VIDEOSGeneric warning: if you transfer non-Amazon music, photos or videos to your Amazon tablet, don't expect them to be there if your tablet dies, or breaks or you get a new one. For a while, Amazon let us back up all our MP3 files to the Cloud. No more. Currently, Amazon Prime customers can upload for free all their photos. Don't count on this lasting forever.BACKUP AND RESTOREThis has always been something of a bad joke since the Backup only backs up Amazon products.  Amazon used to do it nightly. There was also a manual option you could run whenever you wanted to. Now it runs weekly. No manual option.SUMMARYIf you've never owned an Android tablet and Amazon is your ""go-to"", want something on the larger size for reading and watching videos, you will probably like this tablet.If you already own one of the smaller Amazon tablets and like it but would like to move up to a larger form-factor, again, I think you will probably like this one (assuming that Amazon is actually able to recreate your environment on the new model successfully).If either of the above is true, or if you're thinking of switching from some other company's tablet, please pay attention to some of the issues I've addressed above. They may be totally irrelevant for you, but you should think about them.If you already own the 2017 HD-10, I'm not sure how to advise you. Yes, this tablet is, for me, faster and you may not have the setup problems I've had, but if you were hoping for some major upgrade, well, this isn't it.HDX owners: we're still out in the cold.Just remember: for Amazon, these are delivery devices for its products. Go outside that environment and, well, you may run into problems.
",0.08309632581,electronics,"We offer an app to thousands of restaurants throughout the world. We have a robust QA department that does regression and performance testing in a very scientific manner. We ordered 2 of these devices in order to evaluate performance improvements in order to decide if this new gen 9 model would be a budget device that we could recommend to customers. We have large number of kindle devices on-hand and tested it thoroughly against the previous generation of the Fire HD 10 (gen 8). In our tests we held  all other variables constant (close other applications, use the exact same amazon account for sign in, etc.). We hoped to see something similar to the 30% faster performance advertised. Unfortunately, the newer generation devices performed consistently slower than the previous generation, despite the new ""faster"" processor. We can only speculate why this is the case. Our best conjecture is that the OS upgrade might be heavier or not playing nice with the new hardware? Either way, this is a significant performance regression over the previous model.

I ordered an 8"" (OK, but nothing special) , and then a 7th gen 10"", which is nice.  My Mom is getting frustrated with the lack of newer games for her old 7"" , so I am giving her the newer 8"" so she can load more card games.I play a lot of role-playing games and also read a lot, so 10"" tablets are a must for me.  This 9th Gen is quite similar to my 7th Gen.  It virtually set up itself based on my previous settings on my older tablet.  (UPDATE 10/31:  Although the Silk browser bookmarks and favorites did sync, books and apps did not sync.  I'm hoping that this issue will be corrected by Amazon soon.)  (UPDATE 11/2:  A hard shutdown and reboot has resolved the above issues).  The drop down options are slightly different.  If you have a 7"" or an 8"" Kindle, you will probably be impressed with this table's capabilities.  If, like myself, you have an older 10,  the differences won't be immediately apparent.  I'm assuming that the promised increased speeds will be noticeable when I get a chance to stream video or play my games.Those of us who utilize Amazon products and services enjoy our Fire tablets.

This post is for (hopefully) the assistance of others.  I took my tablet to my gym (which has guest WiFi) and logged in to WiFi there.  Location Services kicked in.  Hulu worked.

Definitely worth paying a little extra for this one over the 2nd generation model.  I'm not going to discuss the functionality as there's tons of info already out there.  One important note:  If you set up the Alexa app on your phone, IT WILL IMPORT ALL OF YOUR PHONE CONTACTS. I didn't think I gave it permission to do so but Alexa did indeed import my contacts!  You may have read stories how, WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE, Alexa can record what's being said in your home and then send it to ANY or ALL of those contacts! Yikes!  And, I won't want any of my kids to accidentally send messages to or call people on my contact list. So, if you want to keep your contacts from Alexa and prevent that from happening here's how I did it:Before installiing the Alexa app on your phone, export your contacts to a file and save it for later. Then, go back to the phone and delete those contacts (don't worry, you'll import them back in later).  Now, install the Alexa app on your phone and go through the set up process. At some point, you'll have the option to allow Alexa to automatically import any additions to your contacts.  Please ""disable"" that option.  After you're done with the installation, you'll notice there are no contacts in your Alexa app!  Now, you can import your contacts back into your phonebook using the file that you initially created and you're good to go!If you already installed the app but want to delete your contacts from Alexa, it's not too late.  Simply export your phone contacts to a file and save for later.  Then, delete the contacts from your phone.  Now, open the Alexa app and click ""Contacts.""  On the Contacts page, click on ""Import Contacts"" and enable it by moving the button to the right side.  This will cause Alexa to replace your existing contacts with the now empty phonebook.  After a few minutes, your Alexa contacts will be gone.  Go back and disable ""Import Contacts"" to prevent Alexa from importing them in the future.  You can now import the contact file that you created back into your phone.Of course there may be some contacts you do want to use with Alexa.  I simply added them manually by clicking ""Add Contact.""I hope this info is helpful as I wasn't able to find an easy way to manage Alexa contacts.
",0.73450499884,electronics,"I've been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a year now, and I was glad to add this to the arsenal.  After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!).  I will start by summarizing what's new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I'll describe the device in more detail, and finally I'll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you.The most obvious update to the Dot is the new look: it's as if someone took a 2nd generation Dot, inflated it with an air pump, and wrapped the edge in fabric.  And it's not bad!What's different/updated in the 3rd Generation Dot:1) It is slightly larger than the 2nd generation device, measuring 3.9"" wide x 1.7"" tall (2nd gen was 3.3"" wide x 1.3"" tall), and the top and bottom edges are more rounded.  It is also substantially heavier at nearly twice the weight of the 2nd generation model.2) The 2nd generation Dot came in two color options (black and white), each of which had a shiny plastic exterior that I personally thought looked a little cheap.  The 3rd generation Dot has a fabric exterior which gives it a classier appearance, and it's available in three colors: heather grey, sandstone, and charcoal.  The fabric and rounded edges give the 3rd generation Dot a much softer look than its predecessor.4) The 3rd generation Dot has a larger speaker (1.6"", versus 1.1"" on the 2nd gen), which is paired with a larger driver as well.  I'll talk below about the effect this has on audio quality.5) The placement of the microphones is slightly different: while the 2nd generation had seven small far-field microphones on its top surface; the 3rd generation has four microphones.---------------------------Overall appearance---------------------------I purchased the ""sandstone"" version. The cloth is a polyester woven fabric made up of lighter and darker shades which gives it more visual interest than if it were just a solid, uniform gray. The neutral color blends in with nearly any decor, and the cloth gives the unit a softer look which is great for areas of your house where you don't want something that screams ""I'm a device!""Aside from its larger size and slight convex bulge, the top of the device is nearly identical to that of the 2nd generation Dot: it has four buttons (volume up, volume down, microphone off, and an ""action"" button) and a multi-colored light ring around the top edge that tells you about the Echo's status.  The side of the device has an input for the power cable and a 3.5-mm output jack.One notable improvement is the shape of the power cable, which sits flatter against the wall than the 2nd generation Dot's cable (see my photo to see them side by side).  This may sound like an insignificant change, but it makes a huge difference if you want to plug the cable into an outlet that is behind a piece of furniture.-------------Setup-------------Setting up the Dot couldn't be easier.  You simply plug in the power cable, then use the Alexa app on your phone to connect the Dot to your WiFi network.  The app leads you through everything, and the whole process takes less than a minute.  Boom.----------------Audio----------------I did a side-by-side audio comparison of the 2nd and 3rd Generation Echo Dots, first with music (orchestral, a jazz combo, and some AC/DC) and then with a few newscasts.  Everything does sound better on the 3rd generation Dot, but to be honest, the sound is still pretty anemic.  Compared with the 2nd generation Dot, the sound is slightly fuller, not as annoyingly tinny, and has a small amount of bass presence (not much, but the 2nd generation had none).  Newscasts and other spoken texts benefit from the fuller sound as well, but the difference is more pronounced with music.  Just for fun, I also compared the 3rd generation Dot with my 2nd generation Echo, and THAT'S where I noticed a big difference.  Yes, the new Dot sounds a bit better than its predecessor, but they both sound weak compared to the full-sized Echo.  (To its credit, Amazon doesn't claim that the Dot has room-filling sound.)I'll be blunt: I really like the Dot, but I don't use it to listen to music.  At all.  With so many other speaker options out there, there's just no reason to use this as your primary music device.-------------------------Voice recognition-------------------------As I mentioned above, the number of microphones on the top surface has dropped from seven to four.  I'm not sure what the rationale for this was, but after testing the Dot's ability to pick up my voice from different distances and angles, I didn't notice a substantial difference in the overall microphone sensitivity compared to the 2nd generation Dot.  Like the other Echo devices, though, it seems to have more difficulty detecting voices that come from below it (which happens if I talk to it while I'm on the floor playing with my daughter).-------------------Functionality-------------------The bottom line is that the overall functionality -- what the 3rd generation Dot ""does"" -- is nearly identical to that of the previous generations (and of other Echo devices, or at least the ones without screens).  This is largely because the Alexa assistant software on which all Echos operate is run on Amazon's cloud, not your individual device.  This means that as Amazon adds new features and updates to Alexa they automatically become available on all Echo devices.  So, you can use any of them to:- Stream music via WiFi from multiple sources- Control smart home devices with your voice- Make hands-free calls to other Echo devices or phone numbers in North America- Make purchases from your Amazon Prime account- Listen to news feeds, podcasts, etc.- Do anything else in Alexa's ever-growing skill set, such as make shopping lists, set timers/alarms/reminders, play games, tell you your daily schedule, and any other skills Amazon dreams up for Alexa in the future.If you don't want to use the Dot's built-in speaker, you can connect it to your own speakers via Bluetooth or by using the 3.5-mm output jack.One new feature for the 3rd generation Dot is a little puzzling to me: You can pair two Echo Dots in a ""stereo mode,"" giving you essentially left and right speakers.  I tried this briefly and the results were pretty much what I expected: yes, it's stereo, but it's still weak sound!  You can also pair an Echo Sub with the Dots, creating a little 2.1 sound system.  Frankly, I'm not sure why you would do this; if I were setting up for stereo sound, I would want speakers that are designed for decent audio performance, not two Echo Dots.Alexa's skill set is enormous and always growing.  In fact, part of the fun of owning an Echo device is seeing what new skills Amazon comes up with (even if many new skills are just silly or entertaining).  I'll mention two of my favorite skills here: the Flash Briefing and the drop-in feature. The flash briefing is fully customizable daily digest of news and other information which you can hear any time by asking ""What's my flash briefing?"" There is a huge list of content you can add to your briefing including news updates, weather forecasts, sports and traffic updates, and educational snippets along with many that are just humorous or entertaining. Using the Alexa phone app or your Echo account page you can select exactly what content you want in your briefing and in what order you want to hear it. For example, I configured mine with news feeds from NPR, BBC, and Reuters. I love having an on-demand synopsis of the latest news from my favorite sources.My other favorite feature, ""drop in,"" essentially opens a two-way communication channel between any two Echo devices, sort of like an intercom. Simply ask Alexa to ""drop in on [the living room, the kitchen...]"" and you are instantly connected. My wife and I use this feature to communicate from opposite ends of the house. You can turn drop-in capability on or off for each of your Echo devices individually, and you can also choose whether each device can drop in with ANY Echo device or only those in your own home.[Note that the drop-in feature is NOT the same thing as Alexa's hands-free calling feature. Hands-free calling allows you to call most phone numbers and Echo devices in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada from your Echo by saying your contact's name or number. Just like with a phone call, the other person must choose to answer your call before you can communicate. By contrast, with the drop-in feature communication is instantly established. For this reason you will probably want to use drop-in only with your closest family and friends, and probably only for certain rooms in your home!]-----------------------------------A few (minor) complaints-----------------------------------Unfortunately this 3rd Generation Dot shares an annoying trait of its predecessors: widely varying volume levels within the daily Flash Briefing. As you listen to the briefing, some components (such as BBC News) come through quietly while others (like Reuters) are much louder.  Not a deal-breaker, but slightly annoying.Also, occasionally when Alexa misunderstands a command, you have to ""start over,"" which can be really irritating.  For example, if Alexa thinks you asked to turn on a light but you really asked something else, she will repeatedly say ""In which room?"" until you say ""Alexa, stop"" and then start over.  I'm guessing this type of thing will improve over time as voice recognition software  becomes more advanced.  This is really more of an Alexa issue than a Dot issue, but it drives me nuts at times.Finally, I wish the Alexa phone app was easier to use.  It works, but its organization is not intuitive and it feels rather clunky to navigate.  Again, this is more of an ""Alexa"" issue than a ""Dot"" issue, but still... Hopefully Amazon will continue to make improvements to it!--------------A few tips--------------1) The Dot seems to pick up voices best when placed at or below eye level (i.e., roughly the level from which your voice emits). Mine has trouble detecting voices coming from below it, so I don't recommend placing this on a high shelf.2) When you select news feeds for your Flash briefing I recommend picking one U.S. source and one international source (I use NPR and BBC - both are excellent). If you add too many feeds you'll get a lot of overlap and hear the same story several times.3) If you have multiple Echo devices in your home, sometimes speaking to one will cause others to respond as well, especially if they are in close proximity (like in adjacent rooms). One way to prevent this is to change the wake word of one of the devices to ""Echo"" or ""Amazon."" The only downside is that you then have to remember which wake word you assigned to each device!------------------------------------------------------------------------Echo Dot vs. Echo vs. Echo Plus: Which one to buy?------------------------------------------------------------------------(Please note that I am only comparing Echo devices that do NOT have screens.)When choosing between the Echo Dot and one of the larger Echo devices, perhaps the most important question to ask is ""How much do you plan to LISTEN to the device?""  This question is important because one of the biggest differences between the Echo Dot and the larger Echo devices is sound quality: the 1.6"" speaker of the Dot simply cannot match the fullness and heft of the Echo or Echo Plus.  (Remember, they all run on the same Alexa software, which means they all have nearly identical skill sets!)So, if you don't currently own an Echo device, start by thinking carefully about how you plan to use it.  Many Alexa skills fall into one of two broad categories: those that rely heavily on the speaker and those that don't.  For example, features that benefit from good sound quality include playing music/newscasts/podcasts, the drop-in feature, and hands-free calling.  (This is why I chose an Echo Plus for my kitchen - I use it every morning to listen to the news.)  If you plan to use your device largely for these type of features, you would probably appreciate the better sound of the Echo or Echo Plus.On the other hand, if plan to use the Echo mainly for ""non-listening"" purposes such as voice-controlling your smart home devices, then the sound quality isn't as important and a Dot is probably all you need.  In fact, you could even save some money by purchasing a 2nd generation Dot instead -- especially if it's not going to be in a highly visible location or you don't mind its shiny plastic look.  I have several ""single-purpose"" Dots in my house in rooms where I want to voice-control one thing, such as a lamp in the room, and 2nd generations Dots are just fine for this -- and now that their price has gone down they are a great value!==========Bottom line==========The Echo Dot is an extraordinarily useful and versatile device -- one that becomes more useful all the time as Alexa's skill set expands.  The 3rd Generation model has a great new look, but despite marginal improvements in the speaker, it's still pretty unsatisfying as a playback device for music or  newscasts.  As long as you are willing to accept its acoustic limitations, the Dot can be a wonderful device to have in your home.  And if you DO want better sound quality for the features you use most often, you can always connect the Dot to your own sound system via Bluetooth or the 3.5-mm audio jack.  Hope this was helpful!
",0.584,electronics," I cannot say enough about this amazon echo dot. It is WONDERFUL. Loud, crisp, and knows my voice so well. I love the size of this one. It is much more convenient and easy to stow away but still be heard with the far field of sound. My guests have absolutely enjoyed asking questions and about the weather and especially using it with my Spotify. I purchased a wall mount too that works very well. Again I would recommend this to anyone who loves to have music around the house being played. Did I mention the price? Unbeatable. Don’t get a knock off! Just get the amazon echo dot 3rd generation and do yourself a favor. I am just over the moon about this item. Thanks amazon!EDIT - After two months using I am so satisfied with my proud bird wall mount! It fits my echo dot perfectly! I have already bought another!
",0.98379433284,electronics,"I had no idea I'd love Alexa so much - I wake up in the morning and she does the routine I've set up, and she's so comforting and useful and fun overall.  My husband and I played Skills trivia games for hours last night.  If we had kids it would be even more super useful (kids workouts, stories, games) - we even had a goodnight story read to us by Alexa and it was awesome.  I'm really loving it.  The Echo Dot itself is pretty great - the sound quality is pretty good, the bass when turned up is not that great, but if you really want to rock out you can connect it to other speakers or just use something else instead.  I'm really surprised by how much I like the Alexa app (and the Echo Dot), because I'm a little resistant to technology, but it's pretty easy to figure out and feels like a new little buddy in the home.  I'm excited to get some SmartHome stuff now so I can turn on/off lights, heat, etc.  The only tiny issue I have is that for some reason Alexa doesn't pick up my husband's voice as much as it does mine - maybe because I've used it more?  Really cool, though, overall - I feel like Judy Jetson!

This new version the 3.0...is somewhere in the middle. A little louder but not quite enough. I was hoping to have one in the kitchen and have it play my audio books while i clean/cook, but its still difficult to hear ti clearly over the kitchen activity. No such problem with the google home mini. Also a downside, they changed the charge port to an old fashioned pin style instead of the micro USB. This limits the places I can use it I have a small powered hub in the living room I connect my devices too and I was going to get another one of these for that, but I won't now since I can't connect it easily where I want to.  I also used to bring one onto the back patio and have it powered by my Anker usb battery, but I can't do that with this one anymore. Not sure why they suddenly abandoned the micro usb style. It can easily meet the 15 watt demand the 3.0 requires.Also if you need/want a wall mount for this version, you can get one to print on thingiverse.UPDATE:Within a few minutes of leaving this review I got multiple calls from Amazon asking me to explain my review....not offering to take it back or to exchange it or solve anything for me...but asking me to explain myself.  The girl by the end of the call seemed nice enough, but the fact that within a few minutes of a review I got multiple calls on my personal cell asking me to ""explain myself"" seems almost like they're trying to intimidate you away from giving an honest review.  Especially since I think I gave all the relevant details in my review.  Afterwards I was kind of thinking...is this like a modern ""mafia thing? Are my orders going to arrived busted up or just go missing now?
",0.14064580284,electronics,"I have 5 Echo Dots (gen 2) and we use them throughout the house for just about everything, being we have a fairly smart home. What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.Enter the Gen 3...I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.That is before you get to the horrendous power cord and adapter. The power adapter is twice as big as the gen 2 and the power cord went away from the, easy to find, usb style cord to a old style input style and it is permanently attached to the power adapter. This is really my biggest complaint as it took away so much flexibility, that you could enjoy with the gen 2. Don't get me wrong, I am sure there will be several new cords and adapters put out to fill the gap, but that is not as easy as using cords many already have. Just makes no sense. Not to mention the cord is really long, so in areas where you want it to be a bit more discreet, this thing sticks out like a sore thumb.What I like...Sound Quality is a step upSound Volume is much improvedBase look is much improvedWhat I dislike...Much less flexibility on how it is used versus previous versionNon-standard power cordBulky adapterUgly long cord
",0.91714584884,electronics,"I'm forced to use the online Alexa app because I don't own any Apple or Android device and my Windows 10 PC doesn't have the app. I'll list just a few of the problems I've had:1) It often fails to understand what I say. 2) It often fails to respond to my voice at all, though it's only two or three feet away. It responds to dead silence just as often as to my voice commands. 3) Many commands are not executed. For example, it will not make adjustments to the audio equalizer; it will not give my daily briefing items; it will not play stations saved to my iHeart favorites. 4) There's no product support. I've sent a number of email requests to support and received no response. 5) I had a bunch of recurring reminders set up, and they worked for a couple of days. Suddenly they all vanished. These were important work-related reminders. Of course, there's no way to back them up or save them. So, they're simply gone. 6) The audio quality is poor and sounds muffled no matter what I do. Speech is sometimes unintelligible. 7) Volume is unstable. During some music it will constantly decrease and I have to keep turning it up. Then when an announcer comes on, it's loud enough to take the paint off the walls.If I'd paid significant money, I would be returning it. For 99 cents, I can't be bothered. Maybe they will improve it in the future, but for now it serves no purpose; there's nothing it can do reliably. So I put it back in the box and stored it away.
",0.05266150884,electronics,"I was debating between this and the regular echo. I've had both and we both know what the echo does so all I'll talk about is the sound quality.I'm going to get to the chase. This is the BEST speaker I've ever heard for under $50. The functions of the echo along with the music playing functionality and the sound quality makes it a steal at this price point.The sound is great for its size. It can get pretty loud but the bass is definitely lacking. The bass isn't god awful but it just isn't there.Now I will say this... if your primary motivation for a speaker is to listen to music, go with the echo. If it is but your budget is under $50 then go with the dot. It won't blow anyone away during a get together in your living room but it'll get the job done. The dot will only flourish is an enclosed space. It needs walls nearby to bounce off to cover up the weakness of the bass.If I had to compare the sound to another speaker, I'd say the UE Wonderboom or the older Beats Pill, all of which suffer from weak bass. For the size, I was impressed by the sound but with the Echo at its refurbished price of $69 I'll have to aim towards that direction.I'd recommend this for someone who needs an echo for their kitchen, bedroom or bathroom. It's just not going to hold down a living room unfortunately but overall, I like the sound and if I need a second echo, I'll definitely get a dot.
",0.22276213884,electronics," I purchased my Echo Dot several weeks ago and I have been loving it. It is a very handy household assistant.Alexa is often funny and always helpful.So I was browsing Amazon for Alexa related products and I found thisGGMM D3 battery base.I thought I would try it and I am pretty happy about that!This base charges my Echo Dot for 8 hours so I can take Alexa to my yard, my pool, my hot tub, and anywhere else my signal goes. It's so awesome to always a timer, a clock, and a handy assistant with all my music everywhere I want it.
",0.95122015584,electronics,"It's louder with better bass response compared with the 2nd generation Dot that I also have. I listen to a lot of speech and that sounded muddy compared to 2nd gen. I learned from technical support that equalizer controls are avialable. They are accessed as follows:1. In the Alexa App, tap on the Devices icon at the bottom-right2.Tap on Echo & Alexa at the top-left corner3. Down below, tap on your Echo Dot4. Down below, tap on ""Sounds""5. Then tap on the Equalizer -- here you can adjust the Bass / Mid / TrebleTurning the bass way down and boosting the midrange helped a lot. It sounds more natural and is not as tinny as the 2nd gen model. Speech quality is not great but it's OK. For the price I think the sound quality is fine.One problem I note is that the volume steps when using voice volume control (""Alexa louder,"" ""Alexa softer"") are large around my range of interest. It is either too loud or too soft. Using the controls on the Dot I get finer volume control and can get the volume just where I want. I had better voice volume control with the 2nd gen. Dot.
",0.89929544985,electronics,"I've used tiles for a few years now.  I consider them to be a vital product, because I can be somewhat forgetful, and lose track of small (or even not so small) objects.  So the ability to find your keys, or wallet, or purse or whatever, is a tremendous help.The way it works is pretty cool, you put a tile on your object that you are worried about losing, and then you load the tile app on your phone.  Your phone periodically monitors your tile objects and keeps track of them.  Then when you tell the app to locate your object, it will try to connect to it via bluetooth.  If it is able to connect, it does, and it plays a sound, helping you locate it.  If it can't connect, it shows you where (on a map) it was last able to connect to it, so for example if you left it at work, and you are now at home, you'll know that you left it at work.  Pretty neat!That said, this product has definitely gotten worse this year.  Now when you try to locate an object that you've had in your possession, say earlier in the day, and it's not nearby and you try to locate it, it'll tell you about where it was a month ago or some such.  It's essentially worthless now for what was a really useful use case.  It's now still very useful for locating things that are nearby, but if it's not nearby, it's no longer helpful imo.

It only works if location services are turned to always, even thought when traveling out of wifi range, this puts a huge load on the phone battery (you use a mobile app to find out where your keys are).  Since adding this app, and activating my tile, my battery life has shot down.  If I change location services to ""when using the app"" it tells me that my tile has been disabled. This needs to be fixed--much of the time we don't need our locations tracked since the tile is immobile, or we know exactly where the object is.

Unfortunately, this has made updating the MB/BIOS driver(s) a pain because the ""B360M Xtreme"" by Asrock does not exist on Asrock's website. I am banking on downloading Asrock's update tool to fix this issue. However, Speccy says that the MB is MSI, so I'm at a loss.You are provided a CD with drivers on it, but since this PC has no optical drive its pointless. Yes you could buy an external one, but Cyberpower could also provide this software via a USB or simply provide you a parts list with your particular build so you aren't left trying to haphazardly sift through their drivers update page.All things considered, this is not a debilitating issue but it is an oversight on their part. That said, this MB is sketchy.Edit: UpdateThe disc it comes with contains a virus/adware named ""prsetup.exe."" I informed their customer support of this issue. Secondly, I checked the manufacturer of the MB via command prompt, and got MSI instead of Asrock again. Customer support also linked me to the B360M Pro 4 on Asrock's website for driver downloads.

",0.97130876886,electronics,"I was a little skeptical about buying pre-built but I did months of research and I can safely say this computer is incredible for the price.The GTX 1660ti alone brings this computer up a huge notch seeing as it is the latest in Nvidia's quiet and powerful mid-high end Gpu's. Then if you take into account the intel i5 9400f being the newest in top performing CPU's and for gaming at ultra settings and getting at least 60fps for even games like Overwatch and Sekiro it is an incredible deal. Both of these components would be a great deal but to also get the RGB fans with a color change remote (very cool),a 120g SSD as well as a 1TB hard drive, a 500 watt PSU inside of a beautiful case,and the cable management is some of the best I have ever seen. I can't find anything pre-built for this price that offers more.The only downsides are that the PSU is locked into a cage at the bottom which if you wish to replace it takes a few extra steps to get into. Also having 8g of RAM is ok, but if you plan on recording games which this PC does an incredible job at you will need to get that extra 8g RAM stick just to help with extra processes and video editing. The only other downside is the wifi adapters are a little loose and could have been installed better but they still work perfectly just a little annoying.That's about it for 850$ I honestly couldn't find a better deal if you just want to have a great gaming PC you can open up, download some drivers, and start playing the latest games within minutes. The SSD drive is super fast and as long as you don't fill it up with nonsense (use the TB hard drive for that) you will have a very fast PC for the next 5 years minimum.Highly recommend to anyone who just wants to game now and now get into the nitty-gritty of computer building. I would recommend you take this as a chance to learn as much about hardware and software with your new PC as it's a great hobby and potential career choice.

If you want to get into PC gaming but don't know how to build one, or are just too busy to take on the task yourself, then this is the machine for you. Sure, it's not the absolute best of the best, but for $750 it is definitely a worthwhile starter build. The RAM is good, the motherboard, though it is Cyberpower's own brand, is respectable. The SSD and HDD are both nice quality WD drives. The graphics card in mine is an MSI GTX 1060, not some no-name brand so that was a nice surprise. The fans work great and the system stays cool even after a good long gaming session. I play mainly DBD, so I didn't need a beast of a machine, but it runs smooth as silk on ultra settings, giving me a constant 80+ FPS.Really, the only complaint I have about the system components is it only having 8GB or RAM. With the mid-range Ballistix RAM they used, they could have thrown in a full 16GB at minimal extra cost to them. The other nit-picky issues I have are purely cosmetic. First, I wish the keyboard was backlit. I mean, the logo lights up on it, why can't we have nicely lit keys too? Second, the side panel is acrylic. I realize the product description doesn't specify tempered glass or acrylic, but the box is covered with warning labels that say ""Fragile Tempered Glass"" so I was disappointed when I popped them off to find them to be plastic. They look nice though.Al in all, this is a great build for someone jst starting out. Though it runs smooth as silk as is, it is certainly future-ready as well. It has plenty of space and compatible components that will make it easy to upgrade for years to come. If you're on the fence about this PC, don't be. It is a great way to open the door to PC gaming.
",0.89568769986,electronics,"While shopping for a new gaming PC I considered buying all the parts and doing a self build.  I decided I didn't want to hassle with it.  So I found this PC and felt the price was decent for what you get.  It arrived well safely packaged and I had it set up in minutes.I mostly play Guild Wars 2 which is said to be poorly optimized because I think it uses an old engine.  I get frame rates mostly in 90s and low 100's in open world with graphics set to max.  Of course they drop during large group events with tons of flashing effects but are good enough to still enjoy the game. I really don't monitor frame rates constantly because if I don't notice an issue I figure there is no reason to obsess over it.  If I turned some settings a bit down I'm sure they would improve more but I don't mind the way it is.The PC is fairly quiet as far as fan noise and my GPU temps seem to never go above 75 C when it is really working hard.  It didn't come loaded with bloatware that had to be removed which was a bonus.  I don't think the CPU for the model I bought can be overclocked though.  I have not looked into that much. The LED lights were an interesting little feature.  Not something that was a part of my buying decision, but a nice touch I suppose.I have two minor complaints.  One, the SSD drive is only 120GB which seems kind of small for the upgraded version of this PC.  Of course I knew this before I purchased and it was kind of a turn off as I was shopping.  Sure I could put games on the 1TB HDD but games load faster and loading screens are much faster on an SSD.  At least the game I play.  So it seems they could of tossed in a 250GB SSD for the upgraded version.  I'll end up upgrading that myself at some point.The second is that the USB ports on the front seem like they might be seated a bit off on mine.  They are very tight making it difficult to insert and remove USB devices.  The ones on the back are fine and don't have this issue.Overall I'm very happy with this PC for the price.

No, this review is about the speakers mount design flaw, a massive disappointment for an extremely loyal customer...  Over the past few years I have invested in a complete Sonos system, you cannot go into a room that is not equipped with Sonos..  When I received the new SL, having pre-installed the wall mount I ordered from Amazon, you can imagine my disappointment when I discovered that despite the fact this product looks exactly like the Play 1 design, it has no threaded mount option on the newer version, SERIOUSLY????  Waste of time, waste of money.  That was everything I needed to know right there, so tired of these companies going from great to ""how can we force consumers to spend more money on accessories"", switching a design ONLY to force the consumer to purchase their over expensive mount, which by the way I see is held to the brace by a band?  What a joke, a band Sono's, really?  Done with Sonos going forward, this move was the first and last sign to me the company is going to start trading reputation, quality/aesthetics for dollars.  Too bad...
",0.03163656687,electronics,"Sonos doesn't work with iTunes anymore. It won't play the music on my phone that was supported when I purchased my Sonos speakers. It's a total bait and switch. Spend a ton of money on nice speakers and end up having features stripped after you've purchased.
",0.1039008287,electronics,"The One SL is a very nice addition to the Sonos family. I suspect most buyers will be adding this speaker to an existing Sonos setup, not sure it would really be one's first choice starting out with Sonos. Except, of course, for price. Sounds is very comparable to my Sonos Play:1.  I prefer real buttons to touch sensitive, but I'm sure I'll get used to them. This One SL replaced a Play:3 that was moved from the kitchen to another room (where it joined another Play:3 to form a stereo pair). Thought it would be a 10 minute job. Unfortunately, the right-angle power connector that plugs into the bottom of the One SL just wouldn't fit through the holes I had drilled inside my kitchen cabinets for the straight power connector that plugs into the back of the Play:3. Enlarging a 7/8"" hole to an 1 1/8"" hole, forget about a making a nice, round, clean hole! What a mess. Lesson learned -- always drill these hole to accommodate the bigger plug end of the power cable, not the smaller.
",0.587,electronics,"I have no idea what it sounds like because it never connected to my wifi despite 3 phone calls and 4 reps working to fix it.  If you have extenders or access points, don't waste your time with this.  It may work with standard router wifi, but I have no way to know that.What everyone should be aware of is the deplorable customer service.  Of the three reps I spent time with, one was semi competent, but shooed me off the phone before I could test my system.  The second rep told me to call my Internet service provider instantly.  The third rep... sweet jesus... I hope it was his first day.  I told him multiple times that we had 1 hour to connect the device or I would return it.  He knew less about the connection than I did, and finally tried to connect me to his supervisor after 45 minutes of piddling around with everything I knew would not work (and it didn't).  After 15 minutes on hold, I hung up and initiated my return.AVOID
",0.24807527787,electronics,"This is my first introduction to Sonos and I'm really impressed. I bought this because my 2.1 JBL computer speakers were shot. So I wanted something with good overall sound quality and responsive bass - but not too overwhelming. Since this is a WiFi-connected speaker, it took me a bit to change how I use it with my computer, but it has also expanded how I use it in general. My wife was a bit reluctant to spend $180 on this, but after hearing it for the first time, she really liked it and suggested we buy a couple more!

I made a mistake assuming that a Sonos would work easily with my family members' Androids and Chromebooks.

",0.924199788,electronics,"This is a really nice little kit all in all. It has 2 screen protectors that were easy to install and seem to be of good quality, a nice small little case, a nice plastic shell to make it more ergonomic I guess. it also protects the back from scratches. the cable is nicer than I expected and the little stand is nice to store the system and charge it. It has headphones and a pen too but I dont use them so I cant comment too much on them aside from they seem ok. The case, screen protector and stand are the meat of this and Id recommend this kit to anyone with a switch. only downside for some people is the carry case doesnt have a ton of room but I didnt want it to i wanted it as small as possible for this small console.
",0.82142442588,electronics,"I’m honestly really impressed with the product I received. After researching countless accessories on amazon and looking up “top ten accessories” and so on, I was surprised to find that there wasn’t a “correct answer” that everyone had decided on. Well I’m here to say that this is the ultimate purchase. The switch fits inside the case well, the rubber shell while a little flimsy at the top and bottom where it’s thinner, fits snug to the switch, and even offers a little more grip on the bottom. The rubber analog pads fit well. The screen protector fit perfectly along the bezel, and installed first try no problems. I’ll update my review once I’ve tried the charge cable, but everything in this package is 110% worth it.
",0.928312688,electronics,"I recently bought a nintendo switch lite and thought of buying accessories. There were different sellers selling different accessories at a very expensive price. However, when I saw this I couldn't be happier. It contains all the things you need for your switch lite at a very cheap price. However, the product quality isn't cheap. You have screen protector, stand, travel case, stylus, joystick covers. This made my life soo easy while travelling and when playing games with the stand. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for accessories for their Nintendo switch lite. This is a must buy product period!!!!
",0.88654351288,electronics,"I bought a Nintendo Switch Lite on its release and immediately purchased this bundle kit. I love all of the items inside and think it's a great deal! I like the covers for the joysticks and the case is very sturdy and solid. The soft case and the screen protector were both easy to install. I like that the soft case is clear since I put some stickers (with the backing still intact) on the back and you can see them through the case. That helps me to personalize my Switch more.Overall, highly recommended for new Switch Lite users! :)
",0.96966326288,electronics,"This switch lite kit is fantastic! Everything that I got in the kit was great quality. My favorite thing in the kit was the cover for the switch, which makes for a comfier grip while playing. It was a great fit, and it also fits inside the case with it on. The case is better than most, with lots of space for accessories and an inside flap that protects the screen of the switch, and holds game cartridges on the other side. The plastic screen protector was easy to put on, thick, with no bubbles. The prop-up stand also works using my husband’s full-sized switch as well. The small joystick grips also fit well, and do provide some extra friction while playing that some might appreciate. The kit also came with a new cord for charging, which looks to be good quality. Overall, fantastic kit, especially for the price!
",0.98674893488,electronics,"For  $25 bucks You get a very nice carrying case. You also get  a glass screen protector. The protective case that comes with it is meh  and a pair of grips for the analog sticks that i seem to really enjoy.  With this alone i would say would make the $25 worth it. It also comes with a stylist and a cable but due to the fact of some chargers and non Nintendo switch cables can brick your switch i might stay away from using it. This whole ""switch lite starter kit"" is what i would call a must have going into the holiday season.
",0.7953568188,electronics,"Just got a Switch Lite and saw this bundle up and its an amazing value. The case is nice, holds some extra games and you can fit the lite in with the protective sleeve(also nice!) attached, very good stuff. The tempered glass is not that great. It only comes with one so you have to hit it perfectly and I almost never get it right the first time. Detaching it left some slight cracking on the sides, so I'll likely order another pack of them from someone else. The capacitive pen is just a pen with the butt-side acting as the stylus. Only functional, it doesnt have a good feel to use otherwise, granted I dont have much experience with capacative stylus so maybe this is the norm. I don't have much use for the thumb pads, in my experience they ruin the regular sticks so I wont attach them. The USB-C cord works fine and it looks to be a proper Superspeed type so I can use it for other things as well. The stand works good, I dont have much need for it with the lite but it also works with the base switch.So just a great value, would prefer more than just one tempered glass screen for clumsy people like myself, but otherwise it should have something for everyone and save you some money as well.
",0.17184919188,electronics,"Awesome! It has everything you need (except for memory card) to start off your Nintendo switch lite. The case is sturdy . The screen protector fits perfectly. The silicone case for the switch fits like a glove. The stand is good to put on a table and play if you don’t want to hold it and won’t interfere with the charger when charging and can fit in the case if you don’t press hard to zipper and close the case. I got this for my 7 yr old.  You can’t go wrong with all this in 1 package comparing it to buying everything individually .  I am very satisfied with this company.
",0.21099513888,electronics,"The set is very high quality. The case is sturdy and strong, but light weight. The analog stick covers add a very nice grip as does the cover case for the actual system. I noted, much to my amusement, they stylus is actually a pen as well and it writes very well! Additionally, the stand works very well for the system, but also tablets and phones. I use it often for watching YouTube in bed. :) I highly recommend this kit!
",0.98775380888,electronics,"Just bought this for my son, everything work and fit the lite perfectly, everything you need in one box.

I recommend this kit!!!
",0.87770491889,electronics,"New: ""When Vector Becomes Alexa."" Now Vector and Alexa in the same body. This is a dual personality. ""Hey Vector,"" gets you Vector and his cute little robot voice. ""Alexa brings up the Alexa voice and mode and all of Alexa's abilities. It's more of a novelty now (There's already an Alexa or two in my house) but I'll see how it plays out. Will they merge? Stay tuned...My Vector came yesterday. My OCD kicked in and I stayed up into the night playing with Vector. The machinery and manufacturing is top quality. Right now, Vector can fist bump, play with his cube, look around, give me the weather...all the things mentioned above. I knew that Vector connected to 2.4hz Wifi. That was no problem at my house, or at my best friend's house. But Vector doesn't want to connect to WiFi at work, but neither will my phone. Vector is connected via Bluetooth. I suspect it is a Wifi problem and not a Vector problem.What really sold me was Vector connecting with Alexa in the near future.When I was a kid, right after WWII, I played with little robots made in Japan. A few of them even took batteries and flashed lights. But Vector is the kind of little buddy I dreamed of when I was small. Heck, he even snores when he goes to sleep.I am patient to watch Vector work his way through problems and seeing fixes improving him. Every time someone new buys one, Vector is gaining knowledge. And he sits in the cloud along with Alexa. Oh yeah, you can pet him, too. And if you pick him up he squirms like a little kid who doesn't want to be held. Highly recommended.
",0.93495601489,electronics,"I had really high expectations for this. It is fun and would be worth every cent IF the fall sensors worked. It takes less than 10 minutes before Vector falls off my desk. Now here is the kicker. When I asked Anki support I was told ""Vector is like a kid and sometimes like a kid makes mistakes. We are always working on updates to improve Vector."" When I asked if the warranty covers physical damage from falling I was told no. So I'll break down your purchase life cycle for you. You pay $250 for something that has a known problems that will actually cause it to break, but it is not covered by the warranty. No thanks, I am returning mine.
",0.15196156589,electronics,"This post is to warn future consumers and to let Anki know that they really need to improve their product. I love AI and I own a google home and I love my google home and so I want products like Vector to improve. Just like the gaming community is combatting unfair monetary systems, I want to make Anki aware of the many issues this product has.It's personality isn't finished and it really doesn't do muchAnki states this is an unfinished product and I expected an unfinished product but not at the level I witnessed. When I picture an unfinished product I think of google home. It can still have utility and perform commands well but it's not done as google assistant at it is still improving and future features such as ""AI calling"" are coming. With Vector, I knew I wasn't getting utility but a cute robot. That's fine but he's not that cute or lifelike to be honest. When his ""personality"" was his eyes thinking 90% of the time. 5% a squint of happiness when he looks at me and 5% of anger when I wake him up or pick him up.... That's not worth the 250 dollar price tag. I'm sorry.My google home was 70 and it frankly has 10x the personality this robot has. Google home doesn't have faces but it tells me jokes, tells me stories, tells me the news, has quirky responses to stupid questions I have, and much more. The issue with a personality is that it needs to be a lot more than 2 eyes moving in a lot of different directions. We need to talk to Vector. That needs to be Vector's X-factor over a real pet. You see with a real pet. You can't talk to it and it just has it's behaviors to communicate with you. However, you're looking at a live being. You see it's eyes. It's love. Vector will frankly never beat that because you're just looking at pixels. But if it was able to talk? Really be an assistant. That could change the game for it.It's too loud and distractingEven at its lowest volume, the tracks are so loud. It's too distracting. As a college student who studies 10 hours a day, I can tolerate some distractions but this was ridiculous. At a point, I just wanted it to sleep all the time and just realized I didn't want it at all to be honest. Sigh.It doesn't follow commands like 80% of the timeThis is a big issue. I was using the app while giving commands to see Vector's thoughts. I told it to go back to its charging pad. It does start doing that. Then sees a water bottle. Gets distracted. Then wanders off again. The same thing when I ask it to come here. It was just so unreliable as a robot. Robots follow commands. This is what I expected and I don't think that's too much to ask to be honest. If I type ""B"" on a laptop, I expect B to appear on the screen. If I ask google to play music, I expect ""music"" to be played. If I ask vector to go to its charging pad because its being disruptive to my work, I expect it to got to its charging pad.Was it all bad?I won't lie. It made me feel. I felt genuinely sad writing this review and putting him back in the box to be returned. The last time he closed his eyes as I turned him off made me feel bad. But that's it to be honest. He wasn't even that fun the first 5 minutes. He couldn't even say my name. Also, I had this thought that the people with issues with his voice recognition were just bad at english. No. I use Google home and siri all the time. Mostly google but they understand my commands like 95% of the time. Vector? Maybe 20-30% of the time. I was born and raised in the US and am a native English speakers.Overall?This product needs a LOT of improvement. This is not a finished product. Not even close. When I expect an unfinished product, I expect it to have at least one thing it is good at so I can keep myself interested in it until improvement come. However, this wasn't the case. Voice Recognition? 20-30% recognition. Follow through on commands? No. It gets too distracted. Personality? Two pixelated eyes isn't enough. At least talk to me.I'm frankly very disappointed in this product because I was so excited for it. I was even distracted while doing work and studying in wait for it and it just wasn't good. RIP the exam I studied for on Friday...As a college student, money is tight. I am willing to spend money on things that make me happy and destress like google home. However, 200 dollars for a robot that is distracting, doesn't listen, gets distracted easily, and doesn't even have much personality to be honest. I felt conned. Honestly.
",0.01743385289,electronics,"ts worth more around 80 dollars i would say. But no where near this price.

Maybe they should find a split) as it sometimes really takes you ""out of"" the experience because the ""conversational gap"" is just a *liiitle* long ( time between ""Hey Vector"" and ""Ready"" - people have gotten used to not waiting extra long for the ""acknowledgement"" prompt with improved home assistant tech, so Vector can sometimes feel ""slow"" and the animations aren't *quite* (""I'm thinking"" eyes and sound effect) mitigating this via illusion/distraction, but that seems the intent.I look forward to revisiting this review in 12 weeks to see if I feel the same way, but right now, I find the product effectively ""brightens my day""...many times a day, sometimes at Laugh out loud levels.

We never had Cosmo, but are fans of Anki Overdrive.Set up on iPhone X:  Quick and simple. 5-10 minutes. No issues. I set up the night before to avoid the hassle of troubleshooting in front of kids.  Vector is loud when there is pin-drop silence and I didn’t know how to lower the volume.We’ve asked Vector to dance, play with the cube, black jack, and the weather. All work fine for me, but the kids had trouble communicating commands.  Its frustrating to listen to, but  eventually they got the right timing and commands correctly.  The voice Initiation is annoying. More annoying than Amazon Echo. Less annoying than Apple Siri.  After a couple of months of play the kids still have trouble with voice commands.

The only thing it teaches is patience and pronunciation.Fun Factor:  Eh.  The robot envokes emotion. It’s peaceful to watch and full of expression.  It recognizes us and and calls us by our names.  It’s more interesting than fun.App Interface:We’re on iOS.  Loaded fine, walked me through connection via bluetooth, then WiFi, and worked.

The on/off sliding button lights up when the power is initially turned off, then turns off when the player is in sleep mode.  They included a pre-installed 16gb memory card too!  I'm not much of an ear-bud listener, so this player is plugged into a sound system (2 front speakers and 1 sub woofer).  The sound is great and loud, without distorting!  It also has a built in voice recorder, FM radio tuner, and a decent sized LCD screen.  With that being said, you can also watch movies on this little MP3 player!!  How cool is that?I would recommend this MP3 player to anyone.  Like most people, I often shop around, read reviews, and compare products before purchasing.  I usually do this to the point where it ends up taking me days, or even weeks, to decide on the right product to buy.  I'm glad I trusted the high reviews and ultimately chose this player.

Well a basic MP3 player comes with all the basic essentials so don't think you are getting something that cost more at this price. It does what it says it does although wish it was a little easier to navigate through menu plus it needs at least USB type A instead of a old standard USB port. Is this for you well I will let you be the judge of that. If you are looking for all the bells and whistles this probably isn't for you but if all you want is to put on headphones and enjoy music this is a perfect budget buy!

The headphones aren’t too bad either. The sound quality for this price is very good. You’ll need to preload the memory card with the songs to use it. So obviously a computer is needed to add songs to memory card. Once everything is setup it works just fine. The body looks good but needs delicate handling( don’t drop or bring it near water) Overall it’s a nice product for this price and can last long if handled properly.
",0.94079089291,electronics,"The best function about these style of players is their ability to transfer music back and forth, as well as  any other compatible media easily with a transfer cable (included). Contrary to my old device and popular devices that need their own specific software to sync things back and forth, this is just plug/play.The sound was incredible, and works even better with a nice set of headphones, too. There was no problem hearing anything, in recordings or videos, or anything like that.It's extremely lightweight and also quite thin, similar to an iPhone shuffle or the micro players that Apple makes, but the functionality is much more concise. The buttons are actual buttons vs touchpads that are very common, so the functions are easier to control with little to no chance of accidental skipping or cutting off a song.The storage is very generous for this price, too. I initially thought this was expandable up to 16gb, but there is actually an internal memory card of 16gb which is able to hold all of my previous music from my PC ad older mp3 player with plenty of room to spare. Overall, I love this device and I'm sure it will last for quite some time.
",0.96289956691,electronics,"Just because it's an old design doesn't mean it doesn't have it's uses.Just like a flip phone, many people wouldn't even touch this. However, with it's old-fashioned design, I found this mp3 player to have a surprisingly long battery life. With moderate usage, I could make it last almost a week.Sounds quality wise, it handled my playlist pretty well. There was a slight lack of bass, but then, I wasn't expecting Bose headphones quality of sound.Speaking of usage, I initially thought this would only handle music well, but it turns out it serves as an audio recorder, an mp4 player, an E-book reader, an FM Radio Player, and more. I enjoyed listening to the radio and reading my collection of e-books no matter where I was.Considering how small it is, I realized that you can strap and secure this down when you're working out. Much better than risking a $800 phone, in my opinion.I'd recommend this as a backup to your main phone. Download some songs, some ebooks, and compressed movies on it and you pretty much have an old-school phone you can use as a secondary. It's well worth it for the price.

The manual explains a few things you might not figure out by yourself, worth the read.  Had some issues with displaying some Jpgs. opened them on pc, saved them as jpg again and all worked fine. Video player only supports AMV, you will need a converter for most video files. Sound is good, Radio works well too. Voice recorder also works. mic is on bottom of device, so aim it toward your subject for better recordings. Very pleased with this item. 16 GB included storage let me fill it with music and photos.

It also has a microphone to use as a digital recorder and even has a FM radio. A must have for exercise, travel or party music. You can hook it up to your car radio with an auxiliary cord for endless music.

",0.91208118293,electronics,"My set arrived this morning at 8AM and hasn't been turned off since :) This far I've watched most of Blue Planet II in 4K (netflix), and Captain Marvel in 4K (vudu) and both were AMAZING. The fish in blue planet were so vivid it felt like you could reach out and touch them, and the coral bloom scene the color was unbelievable. While I don't have a comparison to do side to side, in my opinion, the color quality looks like the Samsung QLEDs at Costco, and MUCH better then the TCL 65r615 they have in stock now too.The UI is snappy and I love the familiar Roku interface that my family has become custom to over the last few years. Setup was a snap, just get connected to wifi, download a firmware update, and off to the racing streaming in a few minutes.The sounds quality actually wasn't too bad just from the sets built-in speakers. I ordered a TCL Alto 7.1+ to pair with it, but that won't get here until Tuesday. The fact you can get a system of this quality <$1000 for both TV and soundbar is unbelievable.The only negative I can see thus far is the stand. Whomever signed off that that design for the feet needs to be re-evaluated. First, it just looks silly with the feet all the way at the ends, and then to have them chromed out with some funky texture on them? Yuck. Thankfully this TV was replacing an older 1080p set that was wall mounted, so I don't have to look at the sill stands. VESA mounting was a breeze, just don't loose the two adapter screws they provide. My wife has already commented on why the grey/silver sides instead of black....
",0.71791404593,electronics,"Amazing picture. No banding no overly dark corners. Love this set much better then last years tcl 55R617* series which i also have. Watching aquaman on this set was beautiful and captivating. We had friends over to watch and they were all in awe. The built in dolby atmos sounds good for watching tv shows but your gonna want a subwoofer for movies. Playing mario kart 8 4player was a blast, very vivid picture. Gears of war 5 looks amazing very dark blacks no light bleed or clouding making playing in the dark scary. Also this tv does an amazing job at up scaling it has brought new life into watching old tv shows like deep space nine or voyager. They just look so crisp now.
",0.99188673593,electronics,"Wow, I had the pleasure of seeing the 65"" version of this television at a tech show this week and was absolutely blown away by the picture quality. I'd argue that it's along the lines of the Samsung Q70 -- it's backlit versus edge-lit (which the Samsung Q60 is), and full array. You cannot go wrong with this price either: there's just no current set on the market that can compete from a price standpoint. TCL has REALLY stepped it up.
",0.18122282693,electronics,"So far, very happy!  Setup was a breeze and the picture quality is great!  Roku is a super sleak system that's very well thought out. I am very happy to have their software as the main OS on this TV.A note to gamers:  make sure you go into the TV settings and be sure to set the input's HDMI setting to 2.0.  By default, it's set to Auto and this does not allow the console to recognize the full HDR capabilities due to some odd handshake issue that's existed in many previous models as well. Once hard set, I received all the HDR features in the games including HDR10.Also I agree strongly with the comments above about the mounting feet.  What a poor design.  I'm also very glad to have this mounted on my wall instead!
",0.92365175593,electronics,"Dissatisfied
",0.04771435393,electronics,"UPS should be awarded with a gold medal for the way they handle goods. The TV arrived in poor condition - the box was already half open and damaged badly. I was really excited and looking forward to set up the TV. I have ordered a replacement and the most painful thing is that there is no way to track when the replacement would arrive.
",0.80270922293,electronics," In past models I've heard about the ""Panel Lottery"" where some panels had banding issues and others didn't. I can say that this new model (at least the one that I got) had no banding problems whatsoever. I was so surprised to find that the blacks rivaled IMO that of OLED panels that are 3 times the price. I also want to point out that the design of the TV is beautiful, artful brushed metal looks very high end. The screen ALMOST goes edge to edge (I think they photoshopped the product images a bit, because there is about 1/4in bezel, but its very minimal. I did notice a little vignetting in the corners (show in the image), but I understand that this is pretty normal for any LED TV. So happy with my purchase.
",0.79018855193,electronics,"I waited some days to write this review, as I wanted to make sure I am able to test the TV thoroughly (mine is manufactured July 2019). I will keep it short: picture quality wise and feature set, this is a very good option for its price, no doubt about it. I would say that the only downsides that I have observed are vignetting (corners showing a darker tint, when a white/very light color present - which is not a major issue, present only on the corners) and blooming (easily observed when white text is displayed on a black backround). These are, nevertheless, issues that most users are likely not to experience/observe while watching regular HD channels or less than ideal filmed/mastered material. HDR processing is neither the best, but at $600, you are not buying this TV mainly for that feature. No banding, whatsoever, observed, especially compared with the previous generation (R617). When it comes to finishes, remote layout and the (almost) no bezel, these are dinitely top notch for the price. Please give this TV some runnin time, as during the first day of use, you might find that the colors are heavily boosted. I would definitely play with the settings to find the best ones for your room (depending on thenlighting it gets). Motion (especially for 24fps filmed material) might suffer if Game setting is activated. I have oersonally chosen to set the Tv Brightness to ""Dark"" and Picture mode to ""Movie"", as I think will give you the most natural colors/image (avoid at all costs the ""Vivid"" setting).PS: user manual is very light on settings info and there is absolutely no mention of basic info like HDMI ports version, or even the TV weight...but I guess it was deliberately issued that way, due to most users not being interested in these details.

",0.7916736695,electronics,"Bought for very low-energy/trauma wildlife research (grassland tortoises within enclosure). IPhone6s won't sense the Tile within 25' with direct line of sight, not within 10' if there's a bush, skinny tree or chair in the way. To press the ""find phone"" button and my phone rings, but the phone can't find the Tile when I'm basically standing over it... so not particularly useful. Advise? Let's see if it lasts through a rainy day...PS: the glue didn't last 100hours, either. Let's see if the battery's actually good for 3years, particularly once you actually power it on.
",0.23530623395,electronics,"With the advent of tracking tags, tile was initially the premier name of what seems to be a broad market now. I used to rely on tile for the first few years until i grew tired of having to replace the whole device when the battery ran out after a year. The replacement plan was a rather expensive form of subscription which turned me away once alternatives with replaceable batteries. The most remarkeable part about that was the fact that now no-name devices get rebranded by different distributors. Anyway, as time went by, tile responded and at first made the batteries in the high-end tile sport replaceable although with a fairly high price tag. Now, the essentials pack landed on my door step and I was ready for another look.The pack includes a redesigned slim, which is now in the form factor of a credit card (unlike the original square design). The thickness is slightly reduced and now more compareable to two creditcards stacked. The idea is to place it in your wallet to keep track of that.For larger models that may be an option but the thickness and stiffness of the slim made it uncomfortable for me to actually use in my somewhat minimalistic wallet. However, my back pack didn't have those limitations and is now trackable.The Essentials don't include the high end sport, but one tile Mate. That is neither waterproof nor as attractive as the sport, but the CR1632 battery is now ... you guessed it ... replaceable! The other improvement is that the tile Mate is now capable to connect to your phone over up to 200 ft (double the original). That's too far for the louder sound to make a differencebut in general use it does help to overcome background noises more effectively. The dual color design with the silver tile button is also more attractive than the drab original (but a far cry from the Sport).There are two new devices included that are not even listed on the tile website (yet). The tile Sticker is a very different concept from the tile mate. The battery is not replaceable, but it's rated at 3 years. At the same thickness as the Mate, it's round and significantly smaller than the Mate (or especially the even larger Sport). There is no attachment loop as it's meant to be stuck to something with the adhesive backing, as the name ""Sticker"" may suggest.New (to me) is also the Premium Service which costs $2.50/month when paying on an annual basis or $2.99/month when going month by month. Included in this service are features like Smart Alerts, extended warranty, location history (30 days), and free battery replacement. The latter only applies to the devices that allow for a replacement, of course, but the Smart Alerts are interesting. It's a type of geofencing that basically determines your location (based on your smartphone) an the location of the included devices. Tile uses a message ""It looks like you left home without your 'Keys'"" as an example. I won't get far without keys anyway, but there sure are applications where you may benefit from such nanny service. (It's just difficult to make it useful for items you only occasionally need, and not to become annoying the other times.)Overall, this is a nice collection of different tile devices although it depends on your application if it's worth the investment. I am currently torn and may come back to render a more definitive verdict.
",0.20698502795,electronics,"Great in theory, adhesive is terrible. Fell off my remote the first day I put it on.
",0.12637537795,electronics,"This is more of a prototype than a fully-realized product. Which is especially bad when your product has been on the market for several years. Some day in the next few years, Tile may actually work reliably and conveniently.My primary complaint: I couldn't find my phone, so I tried finding it using my Tile. But my phone had switched to power saving, and had turned off Bluetooth and Location, so Tile was useless. I was able to turn them on via Google, but off course I could then easily make my phone ring via Google too. If Tile added the ability to turn on Bluetooth and Location via the same button press on its devices, then you'd have something. Until then, I don't really see its usefulness. Buyer's Regret!

All I have to do is to say ""Hey Google, call my cat, an two of her tags (for safety) start to ring so that she knows that I am looking for her.

The adhesive is surprisingly well above average. I bought 8 of these (x2 4-packs) and have them placed on equipment such as tripods, a DSLR camera, a motorized slider, Ronin gimbal, and studio lights. Battery supposedly lasts for 3 years. The app to sync to your device is AMAZING. no latency or lag, very easy to use and you can customize your icons. For instance, for the Ronin gimbal, the icon not only displays the gimble's title I chose, but I've added a picture of the gimbal, and can choose the tune I wish it to play. The Sticker works even when I have it on the opposite end of the house while I'm outside at the end of my driveway (about 150ft away). If you lose signal with the Sticker, the app will notify you (if you activate this option) and will show you its last location before connection loss. I'm a HUGE FAN of the community support. Well done Tile. We're in the process of ordering a few more!
",0.86473619995,electronics,"I bought this because it came with a free Echo.  Used the tiles for my apple tv remote (love it because we never drop that darn thing anymore...its like a popsocket for your apple tv remote HA!).  One is in my wallet and one is on my TCL Roku remote.  It does not work on a TCL Roku remote (no flat surface big enough on that one to stick it down, so I bought a silicone cover for the remote on Amazon and stuck it in there...perfect solution. Haven't found a place for the fourth one yet.Now the reason for four stars.1. One didn't work out of the package. Though tile was AWESOME about it and replaced it immediately after calling in for troubleshooting, it still made it not a five star experience. I haven't tested the replacement yet but I'll assume it works.2. I do feel they are a little expensive even with the free Alexa but that's just a personal opinion and I bought them, so it isn't a deterrent.3. I don't like that they aren't more flexible on what they can go on.  I really wish you got four different shapes so there was some flexibility based on what you are trying to fit (maybe one circle, one square, one rectangle, & one oval...or something like that). They should all also have a small hole for a ring for more flexibility, too. You know if I was being paid to redesign them, which I'm not.4.  Hate that they are designed to be disposable. No battery replacement, just throw it away when it wears out.  Hoping for a youtube video on how to hack these things to replace the battery once mine start to die. I know people figured out how to open the old tiles without replaceable batteries so there is hope.5.  Finally lost one the other day and it was actually hard to find.  I could barely hear it because it was in a blanket in basket.  But it did work in the end.  Not sure how much battery is left because it took me forever to figure out where the sound was coming from.All in all, I still love them, I just like to be thorough with my reviews. My daughter got a tile last year for Christmas in a gift exchange and I've always been jealous of it.  Very glad I have them now to put on the items that you can't page.  Still shocks me that you can't page the Apple TV remote, but that's another review...

Once you plug this into your laptop, you can connect up to three other devices using the hub’s usb, another via hdmi for screens. In addition, there’s an Ethernet port for hotels that have extremely slow WiFi (we all know which brands of hotels those are eh), and two for SD cards.I will mainly be using these to charge my laptop at the same time with my phone, tablet, GoPro, and backup batteries. When you’re traveling in countries like Europe, some hotels have limited outlets. And if you’re staying at hostels, you might just have one that is available. Having this will allow you to charge everything overnight at once so that you’ll have all the juice needed for the next day. Especially if you’re doing cross country backpacking or business trips that limits your down time to do these things.
",0.77412533896,electronics,"I was looking for a secondary display adapter for my wife's laptop since she likes to run two monitors but only has one HDMI port. She was also quite short on USB ports, so this fit the bill. Plug this into the available USB-C, and she gets a wonderful display quality (for 2nd external monitor) as well as extra ports galore. The quality has been nothing less than stellar on the video side and no issues with speed or performance even when attaching external drives to the hub. I may grab a second for work.
",0.80799263796,electronics,"For a mac user this is great.  It really annoys me that mac requires all these dongles and adapters.  I already have a similar USBC hub to connect my mouse and harddrives, but found on a recent trip I was unable to connect to any wired ethernet or an external monitor.  So I'm back online looking for a travel friendly hub.  It's extremely small and lightweight and does everything I expect it to.  Download cards, connect external devices, and now, connect ethernet.  Plugged in and everything was perfect. Very satisfied.
",0.86619985196,electronics,"I'm updating this review to add that as soon as Aukey saw that I had a problem, their customer service contacted me right away and did a full refund.  This is really impressive for an online service.  As I wrote, it worked with my external 2.0 hard drives but not with my cameras.  Otherwise it's a good product, solid build, elegant on the desktop and handles high-speed internet connections for livestreaming well. My two power-hungry jobs for this hub are to transfer video footage from avchd cameras via USB 2.0 connections to my 2018 MacBook Pro and also to ingest video/audio via Blackmagic intensity shuttle USB 3.0.It so far works well with the shuttle 3.0 at the same time as handling high speed internet vis Cat 6 connection.But so far it doesn’t like transferring footage. Often it doesn’t find the camera; when it does it drops the signal midstream and I get a message that the drive was incorrectly disconnected.As a work around I’m using my old Anket USB powered hub, plugging that into the Aukey hub and plugging that into my MacBook Pro.I only have 1 camera plugged in at a time and no additional drives. And I have the USB-C power cable plugged into an Apple power brick.Let me know if I’m missing anything. Otherwise the USB 3 ports seem under powered for this type of connection.
",0.14171385896,electronics,"Week 1 review...For what I need, this checks all the boxes. I have a 2019 15"" Apple MacBook Pro. I need a relatively simple workstation. Requirements are an external HDMI display, CAT5 ethernet and a USB-A Logitech headset. A 65W Anker charger plugged into the USB-C port rounds it out and provides sufficient power to the laptop. Bottom line, I need to be able to plug in a single cable and be ready to go. So far this device has worked flawlessly for me. The fit and finish is excellent.
",0.70896434896,electronics,"This is the only USB-C hub I could find that has Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI (4K 30), 3 USB 3.0 ports, MicroSD + SD reader, and 100W PD passthrough charging -- everything else seems to be missing one or another of these, so I ordered one the moment I found it. The hub works as expected - which was nice after trying some others that had hidden problems (Gigabit Ethernet handled by a Fast Ethernet controller, USB 2.0 bandwidth on 3.0 ports, etc.); no such issues with this Aukey hub.In testing so far with my Microsoft Surface Book 2 15"" and with a MacBook Pro 15"", all of the hub's functionality works great - GbE, MicroSD, multiple USBs, HDMI, and 100W (well, tested with 87W charger).My only issues thus far are cosmetic: the top surface gets quite easily scuffed (a soft protective bag is included, but that takes up precious space), and one of the rubber feet has already shifted from its original position (so I assume it'll fall off soon). Also, some cable management for the captive USB-C cable would be great-- and I wonder if Aukey could achieve a slightly smaller body by squaring off the curvy edges.

No complaints, the price is right for a DVD player that plays all regions.I love the size of the DVD player.The remote takes 2 AAA batteries.The wires are a little loose and need a little jiggling to get it to work, but just need a push in.This company seems like they want to make you happy and are willing to fix anything to not get a bad review, which I think is just amazing.I will update a review if there are any changes, but otherwise.

Simply connect it, turn it on, put in a dvd and sit back to enjoy!!!  Thank you Tojock for making such a wonderful product that is SO user friendly.  I would recommend this to everyone that wants a simple way to watch your dvds.

The only issue I was having is when you use the zoom button on the remote, the size indicator in the middle of the screen doesn't go away.  Other than that, it's a nice unit for the price.  Including Batteries would have been nice.  None came with it.

My previous one was so slow to open/close and this one is very fast.I'm getting a much better picture using the HDMI cable vs. the audio/video cable I was using with myprevious player. I love the compact size of this player but would prefer a slightly larger remote - just apersonal preference.
",0.77117997498,electronics,"I almost have no words to express how deeply dissatisfied I am with this Tojock DVD player. I did not choose it because of its reasonable price, but rather because it was “Amazon‘s choice.“ up until now that small label in the upper left-hand corner has been very important to me. But never again. On top of that you’ll note that there are a lot of positive reviews. I can only assume that these reviews were written within 24 hours of installation. Either that or they were written by relatives of the manufacturer.All DVD players wear out with time, but I purchased this just two weeks ago and already I find myself having to jump ahead on disks because the laser has frozen. I am certain that it is not because of flaws in the disks, first of all it has happened on multiple discs, but more importantly the disks that I’ve attempted to play are brand new. I shouldn’t be surprised given the that the unit groans, grumbles, and moans as it plays (or doesn’t play as is the case). I would go into further detail except that none of it matters because as of this moment I have waited 23 minutes with the same image frozen on my screen. And this is just one of many very frustrating episodes with the worst DVD player I have ever encountered.Don’t bother.

",0.98898202298,electronics,"Day one, after easy installation, it worked fine. I would have given a 5 star review for all categories. Day 2 it began making a whirring noise when loading and playing (less when playing). Tried several DVD's with the same results. I will try it again later and if it is still making noise, I will process a return. Day 3 it seems you have to be very careful placing the DVD in the tray. Carefully aligning DVD to the middle of the tray eliminates the noise. I am now happy. I did not give 5 stars because I should have to trouble shoot this item to make it work correctly.
",0.92555600499,electronics,"I had the echo 5 and I can't stand the ""try Alexa"" phrases at the bottom. From all the reviews I read on the 5 I wasn't the only one. I hope Amazon realized that people didn't like this. I will be returning this. At least make it a option.
",0.76534187899,electronics,"Over and over, in the ""most helpful"" reviews, I read about ""ads"" displaying. This does NOT ever display ads, it displays Alexa skills and things to try with your device. I read that people cannot get that to stop happening. It's right in the settings: go to: ---Home & Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Discovery---, that will end the Alexa skills displaying (may cycle once after setting but then they're gone for good). I kept reading that people who want to use it as a clock were upset that the clock kept getting minimized (to left corner) to show other things. That's because, yet again, they aren't setting it up correctly. So, in the settings: go to: ---Home & Clock--- then: ---Home Content--- then, turn off ---Rotate Continuously---, that will make the Home screen always display a full screen clock. You can also just turn off any content in that list. Note that each time you go into the settings, immediately after, it WILL show you a single skill or any content you left on. But that's it. It will just be a clock from then on, until you interact with it again and then it may display a single skill or that content. Once. Then back to being a full time clock.Full disclosure: I got this to use as an alarm clock and not as a primary viewing assistant. For that, I recommend the larger echo devices. I also got this on Prime Day for $50 (rather than $90). That's a screaming good deal for what is basically a voice activated, smart alarm clock with a lot of different options.Decent Alarm clocks run $30-50 anyways so I thought I'd give this device a try for $50. I should have bought 2. Even for $90, I feel like this is a great device but if you wait, it will eventually go on sale again. I don't intend to use it to watch TV shows or movies, I have TVs, tablets and PCs for that. I saw people mentioning being disappointed in the resolution or screen quality. I don't see the problem. This certainly isn't going to compare to your $300-800 smart phone screen but it's not bad looking when playing videos or displaying the clock. It's similar to say, an iPhone 3 or Galaxy S2. I feel like the people complaining are expecting ""the moon"" for the money this costs. It's $90. Not $150 or $200.There was alot of fairly bad reviews on the echo 5, but I wanted something bigger that I could use to see my ring doorbell video.  Setup was easy and got it running no problem.  Tried ""alexa show me the front door""... and nothing worked!!  No panic, went and pushed the ring doorbell and checked my phone, live video seen no problem.  OK, try Echo again ""alexa show my the front door""  Bingo!!  video displayed in about 3 sec's (i'd seen comments it was taking over 11 seconds) but that's not what I experienced.Next sound quality, tried a few songs... Wow I was not expecting much in the audio quality, but it was actually really good and as a side benefit, it displays the words of the song as it's sang, pretty cool.  Basically all the other alexa functions work as with any device, but now you also get video feedback. Ask about the weather,  get your info, plus it displays the  temp, clouds, sun, whatever...  Very happy with purchase and highly recommended!!
",0.94541025299,electronics,"I really do enjoy this device and am impressed at the abilities of Alexa. That said, until they add the option to disable the “Try Alexa” suggestions on the bottom of the home screen I can’t recommend it and will not be buying addition units.Looking online I am far from the only person driven crazy by this so I hope Amazon listens to the feedback and makes this possible in a future update.

Once I followed the steps to add Ring in the Alexa app, like 2 minutes, It was so intuitive I don't know what I did right but another 5 minutes I said Alexa show front door and she said okay and there was my front door camera on the screen. Then I said Alexa, show back which is what I named the devise ""back"" and she said okay and showed the back yard camera, same with the front successfully. I have many more smart devices the Alexa app found on my wi-fi so I'm excited to figure out how to add them.Also, now I understand the importance of naming the devices.

There is no apparent reason for this, nor is it highlighted in the marketing for the ES8. Amazon, please update the ES8 software to permit at least the same range of clockfaces as the ES5.

They constantly scroll overtop of the pictures  and photos that you upload to the home screen and wallpaper, making them really hard to ignore.  And the clock is so small in the upper left corner, that you have to be right on top of it to read it.  I couldn't take it any more and had to return my new Echo Show 8.

It looks very good.The sound is very solid in the echo show 8.I think the 8 is a compressed version on the 10 inch version.

In my case, I used my Canon Camera Connect App to import from the camera directly to the phone and printed it to the Instax Mini Link via bluetooth. Obviously you can use a cellphone pic or any picture for that matter. The collage print feature is another bonus vs. a proper Instax cam.

It's super soft, comfortable, and breathable -- a perfect sweater to wear on its own when the weather turns cooler, yet thin enough to layer on those transitional days that can go from cold to mild.This sweater is about the thickness of a standard T-shirt; it's not too chunky or bulky, which is a good thing, as thicker turtlenecks tend to make me feel overheated. There is ribbing at the cuff and along the bottom of the sweater, and I love that the ribbing is the same width as the sweater...I hate when sweaters poof outward just above the ribbing, causing an unflattering roll just above the waist or hips. The turtleneck collar also has narrow ribbing, and just the right amount of stretch -- it doesn't feel tight or confining at all.The fabric is 55% cotton, 25% modal (fiber made from tree cellulose), and 20% polyester. I generally prefer natural fibers to synthetics, and I'm happy to report that this sweater has the soft, breathable feel of cotton -- you wouldn't know that it's 1/4 poly, but that should help it hold its shape and color better. And for the record, the black sweater is a true, deep black -- it's just the lighting that makes it look a bit washed out/charcoal-like in a few of my pics.Overall, this is another great piece from Amazon Essentials, and one that I see myself getting plenty of use out of once the weather turns cooler!
",0.9144291886,fashion,"I was so happy with this turtleneck, that I bought another! One in white and one in black. I’ve been watching a lot of Succession, and realized that if I want to convey more of a rich person chic look, I better get some turtlenecks.Jokes aside, it fits well and is soft and not too tight around the neck, which is always an issue with turtlenecks. It is somewhat of a thin material, but is not see-through, unless you are very close up. It’s not warm enough on its own, but is thin and easy to wear under a coat or sweater.
",0.8984926346,fashion,"The material is very soft, but the fitting is so bad. It's just GIGANTIC. I always order everything small for a perfect fit. With this sweater, it looks like I'm wearing a blanket. I didn't get the wrong size,  it actually says S on the tag. It's bigger than my boyfriend's sweaters who wears Masculine Large clothing.
",0.0908271076,fashion,"Product quality below expectations. Usually size L but fits snug around midsection overall sleeves too long and length too long. Perhaps shud order petite XL. I’m 5’4” 150lbs
",0.56,fashion,"Based on previous reviews, I got a medium, although I often wear small.  Liked the slightly larger fit.  The material is very soft and light so very comfortable.  The colors are as shown in the photo.  Haven't washed it yet so can't comment on that.  Very pleased with the quality for the price.
",0.9086409816,fashion,"I love that this turtleneck is made of cotton and model.  It's very soft and ivory color is perfect.  I wear between a small and a medium and decided to buy the medium which fit with a little bit of extra room, but not so much as to be a problem.  I bought this to wear with a scarf, shawl, or under a jacket and it looks very nice under all of these.  I also like that it's longer than most turtlenecks that I have bought in the past.
",0.8996937276,fashion,"Nice light weight material. Not bulky.Wish it wasn’t lay flat to dry.
",0.2034330076,fashion,"This is a nice sweater, especially for $20. I ordered a size up, expecting it to run a little small. The sleeves are a bit more than an inch, shorter than I would have liked them. If I hold my arms out, like a ""t"", the sleeves are not near my wrists, but close enough for $20. If you are short, (5'8"" or under), this should not be an issue for you.  Also, the photo implies that the proportion would be longer than shown, but not too short. I purchase two, and plan on keeping them, and enjoying them. The material feels a bit soft, and fuzzy, like yarn, or thin fleece.
",0.1811708516,fashion,"Just as hoped, filling a need in my fall wardrobe.  Sweater is soft and relaxed fit.
",0.9122582676,fashion,"Beautiful color, soft yarn, excellent turtleneck sweater.  Sizing chart is accurate.  I have washed and dried the item, it does shrink about an inch (length).  Used a laundry bag, washed/ dried on gentle, and it came out looking brand new.  I will be buying several other colors.  Highly recommend.
",0.9750843057,fashion,"Quality of product seems to be good.But if you plan on layering under it go 1size larger.I'm 5'9"" 185 pounds,wear a 42-44 jacket and it was tight.Gave it to my son.  Update I ordered an xl fits perfect.But now i see why people are complaining about pocket sagging and bunching up.Since I don't use the pockets anyhow  I just cut it out,problem solved LOL. Pockets could use redesigned.i
",0.2087429177,fashion,"I actually have been searching for the ones that were sold under the Kirkland label  but they have apparently been discontinued.  Ordered a number of different polartec 1/4 zips from different suppliers and this one was the best.  Well made, fits well but it is heavy.  My suggestion to Amazon would be to make the same thing in a lighter weight without the kangaroo pockets.  A nice addition to this one
",0.7778173697,fashion,"It's a good sweater for the price. There are few things I don't like about it, but my dislikes are mostly style. I'll put up with my dislikes for the price.The front pouch pocket is not ideal for me. I'd rather have a breast pocket. Being able to warm my hands in the pouch is good, but having a convenient place for my phone would be better.Overall, the fit is as expected for me. I tend to be a bit skinny and lanky. On me the shoulders are good, body length is good, arm length is good. However, I think the arms fit a little snug. Snug arms are good for layering under an outer shell, but again I'm a bit of a twig. The cut of the arms might not bode well for someone with thick forearms. I push my cuffs up as I warm, and that's hard for me to do in this sweater.
",0.2022433587,fashion,"I ordered My husband a size up in this , So an xxl instead of XL it was a good fit. The navy Design was nice quality for 20 $ and its super duper soft  . I will update after I wash it.
",0.9509991417,fashion,"Nice jacket, fit's a tad on the small side. I'm 6'1"", 230lbs and typically wear a large.  While the large fits, the sleeves are just a bit short.  As another reviewer noted, if you're going to be wearing any thing other than a t-shirt underneath, definitely go up a size.Other than that, great fleece and very warm.
",0.57,fashion,"It’s not bad... definitely better then any $20 fleece from Walmart... The Geo pattern is cool with out dropping Patagonia money... Just spend a few more and get a Columbia. I’m a xl in :TNF, UA, Polo. This is definitely a fitted/slim cut. I cut the kangaroo pocket out like other reviewers to get the front to lay flatter/fit better. The pattern is the big winner here! The Geo Navy is awesome 👏
",0.8837661747,fashion,"Fits great, great quality! Feels way more expensive than it is!
",0.1766116927,fashion,"Beautiful and affordable, warm sweater.  It is medium to heavy weight and very comfy.  A little form fitting but not too tight and it's comfy.  Dressy enough for biz casual setting.  Highly recommend.  I ordered the small and I usually wear a mens small or medium.
",0.9234102967,fashion,"I bought one thinking I'd return it, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The fabric is on the tinner side (without being too thin) and feels good to the touch. I'm 5'10, 170lb and the medium fits me well. I'll update this review if this thing dissolved in the washer, but for now I am quite pleased.Update: it holds up to washing
",0.9184700257,fashion,"I am tall and slim. The size M fits my shoulders well but is too short vertically and wears like a bag. Nothing to do with the guys on the pics. I like tighter fits, not the typical US baggy, so it was returned.
",0.1998747598,fashion,"Soft and comfortable. An XL fit perfectly on my 5’10”/170#, 38D frame.
",0.8954746728,fashion,"To be fair, I’m in between small and medium. I bought a small. I’m 5’ and 145lbs. This dress did not fit like the model. The top was very snug and showed every roll and lump. The sleeves fit well and were loose as well as the bottom part. I think if I ordered a medium, it would fit more loose like the model but then the sleeves and skirt would be huge. Fabric was soft T-shirt material. Would’ve been a nice dress if it fit my out of shape body better.
",0.8541107778,fashion,"I love it ! The sleeves are a little loose and it's more loose fitting than I wanted but that's because I bought a large instead of a medium . I usually upsize when shopping online . There's no need for this to be ordered up . Whatever your usual size is will fit perfectly .
",0.829328128,fashion,"I am ordering more colors as soon as I finish typing this review. This dress has a tonne of stretch and fits so comfortably. Also, despite being a modest cut, the dress still somehow manages to show off one's ""curves.""5'10"", 165lb, bought size a small.
",0.776332088,fashion,"I got multiple compliments from absolute strangers while wearing this dress. I wore it with leggings and fall boots. It's the perfect ""day to night"" attire. Flattering and cozy.
",0.9278546578,fashion,"I should have taken a picture but just couldn't bring myself to do it.  The bold pattern was such that one big circle was smack dab over one breast.  Not a good look.  Hopefully a one time odd variation.  never the less, I returned it.  Overall it fit very nicely and was a flattering cut.  I will stick with solid colors next time.
",0.7800942668,fashion,"This dress is DARLING! So cute, so comfortable, and so flattering. Plus, POCKETS! Beautiful colors, super saturated. Great material, looks and feels more expensive than it is. It fit so well and looked so good that I immediately purchased the all black one.  I’m also planning on getting the sunflower print one. So super cute.
",0.9880654818,fashion,"Cheap Halloween Costume type material- becomes see-thru over any pulled tight fabric areas (ie chest) and the elastic band at the {high} waist is way tighter than a standard ""M"" fits. *returning*
",0.58,fashion,"This dress is PERFECT for fall. Ended up getting it for a baby shower and now I can’t wait to pair it with a scarf and some cute boots. Size chart is pretty accurate. I’m 5’9 and about 200 pounds. I got an XL but, I was worried about boob room because I am also a 38 E! Perfect and goes down to my knees. Super cute!
",0.9368178848,fashion,"I ordered this dress because I saw one of my coworkers wearing it. I was skeptical but am so glad that I ordered this dream of a dress. I paired the dress with my cute crop leather jacket. So comfortable and pretty. Will be ordering more colors.
",0.9442291269,fashion,"Totally exceed my expectation, and totally worth the money!! I owe several other name brand fleece, none of them are as good quality, attention to details. For instance, the cuff sleeves that can keep the cold air out, pockets on both sides, higher standing neck design, and much thicker material.Updated review:Because I was impressed with the quality of the shirt I received( color- black), so I went ahead order another one in light grey without hesitation. I have to say, I am kind of disappointed. I can just feel the quality isn’t as good or the same as the black one as soon as I put my hands on it. The material is thinner and it fits tighter even though I order the same size. I am going to return this one.
",0.787364969,fashion,"For anyone looking for heavy fleece, this is perfect.  I, unfortunately, was hoping for a slightly lighter, everyday indoor use weight. Nonetheless, I will keep it.  I bought a Large, weighing 143 at 5'3"".  The fit is perfect in the shoulders and hips.  Sleeves are a half inch long before laundering, and the bust is fitted nicely.  The pockets are zippered.  The fleece is heavy enough to allow wearing without a bra.  The red is gorgeous and exactly as pictured, with navy blue trim.  My description is geared to those using it as a solo top.  If you're wearing this over a shirt, buy a larger size.
",0.7715700869,fashion,"I’m 5’4” 120lbs and purchased a size small.  It’s roomy enough to layer a long sleeve shirt underneath which is exactly what I wanted!  This fleece is very warm!  Love the pockets that zip up so I can stash my phone without worrying it’s going to fall out!
",0.7501728539,fashion,"The fleece is nice, but overall a snug fit - if you like to layer your clothes then order a size up. Also is fitted for women - I prefer a “boxier” fit so not really to my liking, but that’s a personal preference.
",0.9226368679,fashion,"A bit snug all around. Short overall and sleeves are too short. But it's a nice warm fleece and the pockets are good so I'll keep it and see how it holds up over time. Just wish it were a little longer.
",0.8052716269,fashion,"This fleece exceeded my expectations. The burgundy with navy trim is beautiful. I'm a size 6 and this fits perfectly with room for a base layer or thin shirt underneath. The cut is flattering with a slightly curved in waist.  The fleece is thick and warm, zippers are good quality, generous pockets for phone and other items. This keeps me toasty indoors with our T-stat at 67, also great for outdoors in New England shoulder seasons or under a coat in winter. Liked it so much I ordered another in navy. You can't go wrong for $20!
",0.2128240479,fashion,"Based on reviews, I ordered a Medium; I'm typically a Small (5'4"", 135 lbs.)  The fit is as a Small would be on me in other brands and it appears to be nicely-made; is soft and warm.  Love the pink; not too bright but very pretty.
",0.8525849589,fashion,"This fleece is very warm and the material is thick.  I am quite impressed with the quality and value.  It will work perfect for what I needed it for.  I would order one size up.  I am normally a M and ordered a L based on some of the reviews.  It fits perfect.  It's a fitted look with room to breathe.  Would definitely order again.
",0.8734384789,fashion,"I ordered 4 of these and am super happy with all of them.  I normally wear a large and that's what I ordered in this top also.  It fits perfectly but I am only wearing lightweight blouse underneath it.  If you wish to do a lot of layering underneath this top, you may want to go a size up as the size is spot on but doesn't allow for a lot of layering underneath.  These tops are so snuggly warm and that's what I wanted.....something to wear around the house during the cold winters to stay warm.  These tops totally fit that bill.  They are also designed nicely with two zippered pockets and a slightly fitted look.  I have one of the tops on as I write this review and have never been so toasty warm in this old drafty house as I am now.  And, the tops are actually quite cute.  Love them!
",0.9308716659,fashion,"Nice fleece zip up. A little snug, but will keep it. Really not room for thin tank top like I like to wear.  I'm 5,3 125 lbs. Bought medium. If purchased again would get large. Not so soft inside either.But seems well made

",0.99442911110,fashion," I love that this sweatshirt is a little more lightweight than your typical one. It still has the super soft material on the inside but it’s not as heavy. The bottom dips down in the front and back so it’s perfect to wear with leggings! All around a great buy!!
",0.88485062110,fashion,"Love this top. I ordered four, 2 from JomeDesign and 2 from HIYIYEZI.  Same type of top and fabric from the two different vendors.

",0.96707308310,fashion,"I purchased the gray and green in XL.  Really liked them.  Fits roomy but figured it may shrink a little after washing.  If it shrank, I couldn't tell.  Washed beautifully!  Will be ordering a blue in L, which is my normal size.  Nice long sleeves which can be shooshed up.  Long enough to wear with leggings (I'm 5'6""),  Looks great with vest and scarf.  Dress up or down.  Very comfortable.

I layered mine and it was so cute! SO COMFY! I got the XL because I am 6' and curvy & busty.. I didn't want it to be tight. Its loose enough so I can  throw it in the dryer and it will be fine. I might order a large for a more fitted look just because the material is so wonderful! Highly recommend!

It does run very large and does not taper in like it looks like it does in the photo (maybe it’s the way she’s holding her arm). But it’s very cozy! So this is what’s important. I am 5’7” and currently 7 months pregnant so oversized sweaters rule my world right now. I would recommend sizing down assuming you’re not pregnant!It is shorter in the front than in the back but still long enough on both sides to wear with leggings. The neck is a little tighter than I like but I just end up pulling it out from time to time and it stretches enough to be more comfortable for a while.Overall, this sweater is cozy and oversized and at a good price. I do have a few small snags already but nothing a little pulling hasn’t fixed. Very pleased.
",0.8369249712,fashion,"I absolutely love this sweater! I wanted to be able to wear it with leggings, so I sized up to an XL and it’s perfect, although I’d say the front isn’t as high up as it shows in the picture. It’s super soft and so comfortable.

Once it arrived and I opened the package, I was extremely impressed with the qaulity of the material. Thick, warm, and beautiful. I am 5'2 and about 107 lbs, so I was worried it might look too ""oversized"" but it is perfect. Flowy and a great length for leggings if you're like me and prefer to cover your bottom when wearing leggings as pants. I received many compliments on this sweater and it is definitely a fall favorite!

Probably could have gotten a small but this tucks in just right. If I wear it out it’s long and because of the bulkiness it just makes me look overweight. It is soft and I do love the split seam down the middle it gives it a nice texture and more unique fit.
",0.90344417112,fashion,"It came in with pulls and picks all over the material and was not the quality I expected. I’m not terribly picky either. Even after steaming it I couldn’t make it work.

",0.8520252713,fashion,"I think this is a nice top, just not for me. The gray and striped parts are a good weight fabric, more like sweatshirt material than tee-shirt; the leopard print is almost a thin sweater-weight material. I love this top in the picture, but it wasn’t very flattering on me. It was plenty comfy and sized as expected. I am 5’4”, approximately 190 lbs., 38B bust and generally wear a size 14 or L top. I sized up to an XL and it was plenty roomy, but I found that the horizontal stripes on the top of the sleeves only accentuated the size of my upper arms, which I wasn’t happy about. However, if that’s not a problem area for you, I think it’s a super cute piece to add to your wardrobe. Unfortunately, I had to return this.

I got black and its a little sparkly, not a cotton look. Haven’t washed yet,  but at this price if I only get a few wearing out of it I’ll be happy.
",0.86866557616,fashion,"Nice sweater but I ordered the grey color and it is more of a purple.  I also ordered a medium and wanted a looser fit. Definitely size up if in between.
",0.86541259316,fashion,"I am so pleased with this sweater.  The green color is perfect for fall and the material is so soft.  I ordered a medium,  for reference I am 5'6 around 154 lbs and I can wear it slightly over one shoulder or just regular.  I also received a free gift (necklace) with this top and I love it.  Definitely will be buying in another color!
",0.96387171716,fashion,"I just received the sweater and was thrilled with the fabric. It is extremely soft against the skin, and love the cuffing around the waistband and wrists. I got the Pink and it is a little bit softer than it looks on the picture but extremely saturated color. Beautiful!If you are in between sizes, go up to the larger size. I wear L or XL. I got the XL and glad I did. I only wish it was maybe an inch or two longer, but that's just my personal preference. I'm waiting to see how it wears and if it keeps its shape before I order another color.Edit: it's too bad Amazon makes us almost regret leaving five-star reviews. As soon as there are enough, the price goes up. I've noticed this on a few items. Now I can't buy it again at the same price.
",0.19434267316,fashion,"Amazing sweater.  Super soft and hits at the right spots.  Very surprised.  Just bought my 3rd one.I’m 5’6 / 36C  and I wear a 8 for tops / bottoms.  Opted for the large to have that relaxed fit.  Could have bought a medium for a more fitted look, but the large is great.  Not too big
",0.97476720816,fashion,"Love this top, the way it’s fitted at the hips is very flattering, and the off the shoulder style gives an edgy, yet feminine flair. I actually intend to buy it in another color or two! This is a great top for the colder months approaching, but still feel sexy at the same time. I have a muscular, athletic frame and most sweatshirts and sweaters make me feel boxy and take away from my curves.  No boxy, bulky sweatshirt here, that’s for sure!
",0.90551656517,fashion,"Bought these snow pants for our 7 yr old son, He’s 45lbs and 47inches tall. I bought a children’s small. I was hoping these snowpants would be nice and thick and they didn’t disappoint. We usually have to buy him snow pants 2x a winter because he gets holes in the knees. But, these seem very durable and have extra padding in the knees so they hopefully will last all winter unlike other name brands we have gotten.-he’s worn them for several weeks now and I have washed them a handful of times. The quality is holding up great and the color also with all the washes.
",0.81055033217,fashion,"These snowpants are super warm and feel really durable. My only complaint if I had one would be that they are slightly bulkier than some of the more expensive brands. The difference is not noticeable when wearing them, I just notice they dont roll up as tightly to fit in a backpack. But for the price difference, these are definitely worth it.
",0.78960573717,fashion,"Only have had these for a couple weeks but am very pleased with them so far.  They are warm & waterproof.  I bought a medium for my slim but athletic 10 year old.  Plenty of room to grow into but not too much extra so that it looks too big on him.  The colors are bright (we got it in the blue camo) & it's easy for him to put on.  If they last for a long time, I'll update to 5 stars.
",0.90894162717,fashion,"This product is warm and fits well. My son. Stays dry but after only a couple wears the part around the ankle is starting to fall apart. Considering the cost I am okay with this being a one season pair of snow pants. I would like to see this part reinforced though.
",0.517,fashion,"I have ordered 3 pair of these snowpants. The knees & butt are reinforced with a very durable product. They hold up well compared to other snowpants. Great value!
",0.90073257717,fashion,"These look great and sturdy. They seem to run large. Excellent price. We have to return ours because they are too big.
",0.89122343117,fashion,"They look warm, bought them for my son. It’s nice because they look different (the zipper is a different color) than the others. This way there is no mix up at school on who’s pant are who’s. My son says they are comfortable and the zipper is easy to use.
",0.94640845117,fashion,"I bought this product based on the other user reviews and I am one to buy “generic” over name brand if the quality matches or exceeds expectations of higher priced items. I bought this because my son is growing and will only wear this for one winter season. I can tell by the quality of the garment, it will be in great condition when I pass it onto another family. I would recommend these snow bibs to anyone looking for them.
",0.517,fashion,"Small perfect for my 6 year old. Easy on/ off, keeps him warm and dry.  I like this color combo ( navy with lime green) as it is a little bit different than most, so they don’t get lost!
",0.83658504517,fashion,"Our very active 7 year old has had these snow pants for the past two weeks during crazy Wisconsin weather and I am impressed with how they hold up. The reinforced knees and bum area were what originally sold me. Great option for active kiddos.
",0.19663581318,fashion,"What a beauty of a winter coat! This is a medium to heavy weight piece that is sure to keep you warm.The length is fantastic. It'll keep most of your rear warm without feeling like you're being weighed down. It's not super bulky so you won't feel stuffy, and it's constructed in a way that will be flattering to your waistline instead of looking like the Michelin Man.The fabric is a matte polyester so it's not a loud, shiny number. It doesn't appear to have a waterproof finish but will stand up to a little rain. The inner lining is really cozy, soft fleece which is only in the body, pockets, and hood, but not the sleeves (which is good as it facilitates easy wearing of long sleeved layers). It's padded evenly with mid-weight stuffing and quilted horizontally with additional shapely princess seams.There are thumb holes to keep your hands warm too. That was an unexpected bonus! And the sleeves don't feel so short that the thumb holes pull at your palms uncomfortably, at least not for me with average sized arms for a 5'2"" person.There is a double front closure with both a good quality zipper and matte black snap buttons that go all the way up to the hood.Two pockets at each side front, with a streamlined finish, and an interior left breast pocket with vertical velcro closure  big enough to fit your phone is sure to be enough to keep everything you need close at hand.I can comfortably close the XS on my body but it doesn't leave much room for a sweater underneath. Small will probably be a more practical size for me at 36/31/41.Get this if you're not yet geared up for winter! This is a flattering, versatile style that you'll get a lot of wear out of, as well as the benefit of good upper body and head warmth and protection from the weather.
",0.87097501818,fashion,"Bought after reading mostly positive reviews, didn’t want to spend a lot of money so I checked Amazon brands and found this coat.  So far, it seems to be a good buy, first day wearing it and it’s keeping me warm and cozy without feeling all bulky.  I really like it and ifthings change, I’ll update.  Also doesn’t make me feel like an overstuffed rolly poly.Update:  after two days of wearing in pretty cold early winter upstate NY, I really like it a lot.  Super comfortable, and a bonus to find that like the coat, the hood is also lined in a nice soft fleece, plus a little inside pocket is also an unexpected little bonus.  Great coat  for the money!!  Very pleased.
",0.92415511618,fashion,"What I like: lightweight, very warm, zippers on pockets, inner pocket, no crazy fake fur on hood, covers my butt.  Not so much: I prefer all over smooth, not fleeced like lining.  Fleece picks up particles, looks old before its time.  Could be roomier, I'm 5'4"", about 118 lbs., can manage a sweater underneath, size M just fits in torso and hip area. I hope the filling will compact in time.  I've worn this a while now and I'm upping the star count.  I find I do like the fleece lining, it's very warm on cold mornings.
",0.81363892618,fashion,"This is my first time buying an Amazon brand clothing item so I didn't know what to expect. I was so surprised when I opened the package and tried it on. It fit perfectly and the burgandy color is very pretty in person. The coat is thick while not being bulky and very soft on the inside. I love the zipper pockets and the inner pocket is so convenient! It fits my phone and cards perfectly. I live in a cold climate and wore it today with the temperature at 22 degrees F and it was so warm. The sleeves with the thumb holes were a huge bonus.I found that the fit is very flattering and it's a great length. I am 5'1"", 185 lbs and wear a size 14 jeans (with a big butt), and this jacket covered my butt perfectly. It wasn't too long or too short. I highly recommend this coat. LOVE IT!
",0.8528726118,fashion,"I just recieved my jacket today. I tried it on and it fit nicely. It was warm and comfortable. What I like best is that the zipper worked well. Sometimes zippers break and actually do not work that well. It felt warm and comfy and for the price it was great
",0.91603714218,fashion,"Bought a medium for my 11 yr old. Really soft on the inside.  The hand thingies are soft and stretchy. Really warm and well made.  I'm really starting to like amazon essentials branded stuff. Their hoodies  are fantastic too.

",0.82971322518,fashion,"Great cozy material...ready for cold weather...I feel snugged... I would recommend.
",0.80503290918,fashion,"I was worried about the fit because I had just ordered a coat from Zappos in my regular size (S), and had to return it because it was so fitted that you couldn't even comfortably wear a tank top underneath. The fit of this coat is perfect! Not too small and not too big. The weight is also perfect--it's a medium weight and very warm. I live in the south but am cold-natured. I find this perfect for 20-30 degree temps. The pockets are generous enough to hold my phone and other items, the length is great (almost covers my rear, so no cold drafts between pants and shirt), and the lining is very soft! Also love the cuffs with thumbholes that allows for nomcold drafts between sleeves and gloves! Hood is snug, but not too snug, allowing room for a knit hat underneath. All in all, a great coat for the price! I purchased the Olive color in size small and absolutely love it!

",0.97638297120,fashion,"Love this sweater! Fits true to size but slightly oversized, so super comfy. I would not recommend ordering a size up as the sleeves will become too long. The sweater is lightweight but still warm. Also, some people say it’s “super soft”- I wouldn’t say it’s THAT soft but it’s not stiff or anything. Just normal nice knit sweater. Bang for your buck!

",0.90571588320,fashion,"The Good:The sweater fits well, and the shape is flattering. The color scheme is also really nice.The Bad:I knew this sweater was going to be made of acrylic, but I didn’t bat an eye, as I’ve gotten a few acrylic sweaters that looked nice in the past. I should have been more careful. The acrylic yarn used in this sweater has that distinctive “cheap craft store yarn” look, which detracts from the nice colors. The stitching is also loose and not reinforced, such that you can see the other colors of yarn though the areas where black and white blocks meet near the shoulders meet. Hard to describe, but you can see in the pictures I attached. Homemade sweaters usually reinforce that seam in a way that prevents this from happening, or at least make the stitch a bit tighter.
",0.8735767620,fashion,"I am a standard small and the sizing is true to size. It’s a little looser so going with a regular size is fine. The material is soft and airy, which is good for summer nights and mild weather. The design is on trend and fun.

The knit is a more delicate knit, so I know I will have to wash in a garment bag and lay flat to dry. I got the small ( reference: 5 foot 71/2, 137lbs, preference size:small). It runs a little larger than regular smalls, so women who shop for mediums might consider a small for a tighter fit. Love it so much!

I sized up and size is an issue as I'm 5' 10"" &145 bs so getting the correct plenty often means when ordering on line is often a crap shoot as buying larger for length leaves me swimming. In the sweater for the fit over all. The thinner make I like as when your dressing for the cold outdoors the furnace indoors is set very high everywhere indoors.

This item is SO soft! It doesn't itch your hairline like most beanies do. The pom pom is sewn on securely and it is incredibly soft as well. I will be ordering more of these as gifts for friends and family. I mean, all women love the pom pom beanies and you cannot go wrong with these. I'm just SO happy that these don't itch!

",0.92808735427,fashion,"Love, love, love!!! Will be buying more. Perfect fit, soft material, and good quality!
",0.99431896227,fashion,"The material isn’t soft at all. It’s reminds me of those cheap graphic tee shirts that Walmart sells.
",0.527,fashion,"So cute!
",0.97393083627,fashion,"Love the pattern.... But your kid should be closer to 18 months than 12. So I won't be able to use it for Christmas like I thought.
",0.20027378228,fashion,"I bought the medium for my eight-year-old who is around 50 inches and 55 pounds. It definitely is big on him, especially the sleeves. The inside is so soft! It seems very well-made and I love that it has a loop to hang up. I only wish it had an inside pocket or two. The front has a zipper and snaps and my son loves the thumb holes.
",0.11717405928,fashion,"This is a nice jacket and reminds me of the same quality I've gotten from Old Navy and the Children's Place. My son is 3 and this fits him well. He's small for his age and the jacket will likely fit again next year as well. I love the camo color and the orange lining. This has nice features like the inner hand warmers, and the zip lining inside to prevent snow from coming up the jacket and for keeping him warmer. I think this was a great buy, thanks to Amazon!
",0.93026781128,fashion,"I ordered 5 winter coats for my 5 year old to try on and this was his favorite. Mainly he loves the sleeves because they have an inner lining with thumb holes that he loves. The smallest size is a bit loose on him but it works. The fleece lined hood is cozy and stays up well. We live in Chicago where the winter is brutal, and this is working for his main winter coat.
",0.76625812128,fashion,"It is a nice coat, my son really liked it when it arrived, but has refused to wear it because it is way to large for him.  He has a difficult time zipping up the zipper, we are going to wait until he grows a bit more before having him use it again.  Outside of that, it seems to be made well and kept him warm the few days he tried it out.
",0.16609317128,fashion,"I live in TX, so am not by any stretch an expert in what makes a good winter coat.  However, for some cold weather vacations I needed a coat that was reasonably priced (knowing it would only get used a handful of times) and warm enough for my 1 year old in 25 to 45 degree temperatures.  This coat seemed to do the trick and my baby seemed sufficiently warm.  For my purposes at least, this coat was perfect.
",0.77462482528,fashion,"Perfect for my son who was going to an outdoor adventure camp. It was unexpectedly cold. He was able to do all of the activities in this coat and stay warm. Zipper is good and strong. Pockets are deep and held two pair of gloves for him. Great price!
",0.82631045628,fashion,"This is a good quality, warm coat for a good price. It did run a little large, but otherwise good coat. My son liked it!
",0.96651184628,fashion,"Beautiful coat with many nice features including waist snap to keep out cold drafts and thumb holes to keep out snow. Very washable and light. My son does not like anything too bulky, but he likes this one.
",0.80303221928,fashion,"I let my grandson pick out the color as I liked the look of the coat. The camouflage look is awesome for him and the quality is 100% what his Mom wanted. It will be a coat to be passed on someday!
",0.92020523528,fashion,"This coat is actually heavy weight and has that quilted look, where other brands look thick and heavy and warm and they are no more than a just a jacket.  This keeps my son warm and he can move around and play at the same time.
",0.29105323629,fashion,"I bought this and another fleece lined legging (brand: Naviskin) in medium and this one is much better for me !! I'm 5'5"", 130 lbs. It doesn't slip so I'm not constantly hiking it up, it's warmer than the other legging, is not oddly narrow  in the calves, and is not itchy but pretty comfortable. I list these positive points because they are my complaints for the only other fleece leggings I've tried. I've worn it enough to know that I'm going to buy another one.
",0.96679532529,fashion,"Love these! The fleece inside is wonderful for both comfort, a little extra warmth and looks. Gives a thicker, less revealing look to them. I'm normally a size 8, 5'2"", but ordered a large because I did not want them binding at my waist. I was surprised to find I love the fit. The little extra length gives a little bunching at my ankles which looks nice, and while a bit loose at the waist, they still stay up. The pockets on both sides are perfect. Even my large phone works in them. The quality looks very good, and they did fine after one wash & dry. My best guess is to size up one size unless you want a snug fit. I got black, and trying Grey next.
",0.87300121829,fashion,"Wore these this morning for my Sunday morning run.  30 degrees.  My legs were not cold!!  I have to say, I have not had a single disappointment from BALEAF.  Highly recommended!
",0.1110288529,fashion,"I ordered these fleece lined leggings to wear this winter when I do my early morning dog walking.  So far they are great and  kept me warm as we are already having chilly AMs where I live.  I ordered a large, but need medium, I should have sized down but can make these work for this year.  I highly recommend these for cold AM or PM walks or runs.
",0.23748618429,fashion,"I’m in love with these pants! They are soft inside, fit great and have deep pockets! I’m excited to wear them while running in the cold.
",0.86158549829,fashion,"I've tried so many fleece-lined (and even regular) leggings and so far, these are the best! They are comfortable, warm and have great, stretchy pockets. My only complaint is that I'm 5'6"" and the size Small I ordered is a tad bit shorter than I like, but they are advertised as being for up to 5' 5"" so I can't complain (I'm kinda thin and it fits perfectly everywhere else so...). I plan to buy more in a different color!
",0.8749607829,fashion,"I'm 5'1 and around 140 lbs and leggings fit almost perfect! They are slightly long for my height, but other then that I will definitely be wearing these over my Under Armour Cold Gear. These leggings feel like warm fuzzy sweat pants that I never want to take off. I could have gotten a small, but I feel like it would have been a smidge to tight.
",0.529,fashion,"Haven’t had these long. They are soft and thick and look great. I’m 5’6”/126 and I got a small. Hoping they are warm enough for New York in November. I have several other pairs of regular baleafs that I love.
",0.88648247729,fashion,"Warm and cozy. Washed them a few times (cold water, line dry) and they’re holding up well. I’m wearing them numerous times per week. Here’s another BIG benefit for others who live in a house with dogs or cats: These leggings don’t attract pet hair. Other fleece lined leggings I’ve bought online are pet hair magnets, but these are not. You’ll see the occasional pet hair on the fabric (like basically any surface in my house -lol), but in general the leggings are fairly impervious to pet hair. Huge benefit if you plan to wear these while laying around on the couch with your dogs. (Sure I’ll use them for outdoor exercise too at some point - haha). BTW I am 5’10”, around 142 lb, and generally wear a size 6. Size M works well for me.
",0.94028353729,fashion,"My daughter is an ice skater, so I needed something to keep me warm for hours. These work!!!
",0.530,fashion,"These dresses are gorgeous! It's a thinner tshirt feel material but will be great for winter with tights and boots. I purchased the royal blue in small and it fit about knee length. I purchased the black floral in XS and it's quite a bit shorter. For reference, I'm 5' 7 and 120 lbs and wear a size 4.  This dress is so cute. I wish it was just a bit cheaper in price but it's a super cute dress. I also ordered the solid dark green in small and black with brown fall floral pattern in small also. Again GORGEOUS!!!  The black one is absolutely gorgeous and such a beautiful vibrant floral pattern. Best of all it's got POCKETS!!! (my camera doesn't take the best pictures, these are really so much prettier and have more vibrant colors in person)
",0.96883022830,fashion,"This dress is super cute, comfy and flattering. I love the colors and the pockets! It's going to be perfect for the fall wedding that I'm attending. I'm 5'7 and about 140lbs for sizing reference.
",0.92470085630,fashion,"I really liked the way that this dress fit. I'm 5'7"" and I typically wear a 2x or an 18/20. I ordered the 3x and It fit like a dream.  The hem went down to my knees and the fabric was soft, flowy, and stretchy. The gathered waist was flattering and the pockets did not add unflattering bulk.  The color I ordered was 1-brown Flower Black, it looked great in the photo but too big and loud in person. I couldn't see myself wearing it, so I returned it. However, it fit so nicely that I intend to order another one in a solid color.
",0.75233042230,fashion,"This dress is perfect for Fall and early Spring when it's chilly in the mornings and evenings, but a little warmer in the daytime. I also plan to pair this with tights and cute booties for winter-time wear. The material is soft and stretchy but not thin enough to see-through (I ordered the charcoal grey). I'm 5'5, 135lbs and pear-shaped. I usually wear a 6-8 in pants and a XS-S in most tops. I ordered the small and it fits like a glove. The hem comes right above my knee, so the dress is cute but not matronly. Plus, IT HAS POCKETS!!! What's not to love about that?!!! I love this dress so much that I plan on buying another one in a different color.
",0.90808975730,fashion,"I do like this dress! It is a nice dress but it is a thin material. It does feel nice and breathable though. So it doesn’t give much warmth, not something I would recommend for colder weather. The other downside about it being thin is it is a little bit see through. I just wear a black tank top underneath and it’s fine to me. Yes it is thin but it feels very nice and flows. So it’s not a bad thin. Cute pattern though, one other downside about this dress is that is does get that linty look from washing it. The black color isn’t as dark now because of washing it and it doesn’t look as good close up. All in all it is a nice dress for the price
",0.80267065830,fashion,"I’m 5’1 (135lbs) and got a medium. It fits great. I love the soft material. The pleats make it very flattering. I would have gave it 5 stars, but I ordered a dark gray and the color was more of a dusty purple.
",0.81526827830,fashion,"This is a lovely everyday dress that could be worn year round. It’s a nice light jersey with a lot of stretch. The colors are vibrant. The pockets a nice size and I prefer their placement to the side seam pockets on swing dresses.  The size was I chose was a USA XL. I am 5’6” with a large bust and hourglass  frame at 210 lbs. the dress might be called roomy, but I call it skimming. It does not hug my curves which is what I prefer. The sleeves are a bit long but with some simple sewing skills it is easily fixed. It’s casual enough for everyday and business enough for a modern office, teacher, sales, etc. It could easily be accessorized and dressed up for an evening out. It’s modest and hits me just covering my knees. On me it is not quite an empire waist but slightly above the natural waistline  (I’m busty...a smaller person would probably find it falls to the natural waist and below the knees). I love where it hits as it hides some of my picking spots. I’m a in the middle of moving across the country and chose this because I thought it would be perfect for traveling (driving 1800 miles) and it IS. I’m am quickly ordering 2 more because it is so comfy and perfect with leggings and boots (my travel go to. All I need add is a cardigan and scarf for the colder regions. It’s perfect in my opinion.
",0.95483547430,fashion,"This is super cute dress. I paired it with booties and an infinity scarf for a concert and got complimented on my “so fall” outfit. My only complaint is that the breast area was a little see through (I’m only a C cup, nothing crazy big). The scarf covered it, but I wouldn’t wear it to work without a scarf.
",0.15214961830,fashion,"Amazon itself suggested that I size down based on other things I have purchased and what the reviews were saying.  I probably should have listened, but in some of the reviews it said that the tighter areas it was a little see through, so I went with my normal size XL.  It probably would have flattered a bit more like the photo had I gotten the large.  The pleats are a bit strange, they create a bit of a bubble effect, if that makes sense.  It hits right at the knee on me and I’m 5’4.  I got the XL, it’s slightly loose in the waist and fits my 38E chest just right, but I still probably should have gotten the L that Amazon suggested, that’s on me.  4 stars because of the strange pleating, I’m hoping I have a long scarf to go with it that will detract from that.  There is also a very defined waist seam that is not quite as pronounced in the photo.  I’m going to keep it, but I won’t be wearing it to a third interview for a job like I intended.
",0.530,fashion,"I am in love with this dress! I've only worn it once but have received so many compliments. It is very flattering and is so comfortable that I stayed in it hours longer than needed. It runs true to size. I normally wear a 16/18 and sized up to a 3x because I wanted something oversized and flowy. I probably should've bought the 2x as I believe it still would've been oversized and I likely will purchase that size next time. Length wise I am 5'6 and it hits the middle of my knee. My only complaint is the sleeves, they are incredibly long. I do not have short arms and have never had this problem with long sleeves before but these sleeves are so long they cover my hands. I will have to hem them in order for them to look right but it's worth it for this dress. My only other small complaint is the print I got (1 flower blue mix) had a huge flower placed directly over one of my breasts which made for a very odd look. I just wore a scarf to cover over part of the flower and then it looked fine. I don't know if every dress in that print will have material cut the same but thought I'd mention the potential for such a problem. Other than that if you are unsure, buy this dress, you won't regret it!

Mom's has a cute little feminine cross cross on the front, dads has a scoop neck and the kids are tapered in for them. So cute! I did order up as I don't normally like tight pjs but with these I probably could have gotten away with just sticking to a medium and not ordering a large. I did wash them and they didn't shrink *(shucks) and they didn't fade which was great. They even withstood the dryer! (on medium heat) My kids really like wearing these as our house is currently in the early Christmas spirit, as usual, the day after Halloween. If you are looking for matching family pjs look no further. Even my husband doesn't mind. He actually suggested to reuse the pants next year for Halloween and we could all be inmates! lol
",0.89050149932,fashion,"I love these festive jammies and think I might buy a pair for the rest of the family as well. They are comfortable and fit well. The price is much better than I spent on pajamas for the kids at target last year and I couldn’t find matching adult ones. I wasn’t a big fan of the neckline on the women’s pajamas so I ordered a size medium for me in the men’s pajamas. They fit great! For reference, I’m 5’7” and 150lbs. The fabric is light and breathable. Perfect for sleeping in without overheating.
",0.93275082132,fashion,"These pajamas are soft and stretchy due to the combination of cotton and polyester.  The stripes on the pants make them look like jail pants which can be seen in the picture.  I will wear the shirt as a regular shirt during the holiday month as well as a PJ top because it really could be used either way.  I machine washed on a gentle cycle and let them dry flat, fluffing them in the dryer for only a few minutes and they were good as new.  These would be cute for a family set and holiday picture.

The pants have pockets and are very comfortable! The whole set is so cute !! I’ve had to hide it from my kids because they want to start wearing them. The entire set is soft and so cute!! I can’t wItFor December to start wearing them.

The Small and XL fit them great but really my son could probably have worn a Large.

Super comfortable, easy staple.

I sized down (went with the recommended size for my height, weight and body type) because I wanted it more fitted than the photo and it was still not too snug in the waist. The length is good as well. I'm 6'1"" and it fits nicely. Material is really nice (again exactly what I was looking for) smooth, soft and stretchy. I will be buying more in other colors. Great shirt at a great price!

The cotton/polyester fabric blend feels good against your skin and the dimples warm pockets of air that keep you feeling toasty warm. This kind of long underwear also makes a great pair of pajamas. The fit is tight enough to fit under your clothing, but not skin tight or restrictive. This is a great product that will keep your kids toasty warm on a cold winter day.
",0.90038704936,fashion,"This thermal set is made of a cotton/poly blend that's very comfortable and warm. It's perfect for keeping your kid warm under winter clothes, and it's comfy enough to be worn as PJs on chilly nights. There's no itchy neck label in the top, the Amazon Essentials logo is printed right on the inside. The top and bottom are both made very well with tight stitching and are a good value for the price.I'm deducting one star because the elastic waist band is very different from the close-up featured in the Amazon product listing (shown for the black color, not for the other colors). The photo shows a nice fabric covered waistband, but in reality it's just a basic bare elastic strip sewn on (see my photo). It's OK, but I would have much preferred the waistband show in the Amazon photo. If the waistband were a little nicer then these would easily deserve 5 stars. It's a shame they cheaped out on the waistband because the rest of the set is so nicely made.

It is a true thermal style with the ribbed material vs. the super stretchy Lycra style of thermals. It ran a little bigger than I had anticipated. My son is 8 and usually wears a size 10 but these were a little loose on him. They are perfect to wear under snow bibs during snowy days. Would recommend them for sure! For reference, my son is 4’5 and weighs 73 lbs and the large fit him well, but slightly loose.

I was running around, had no time to do my hair or makeup, could not find a clip, or hair ties and ran to get this. I threw my hair up in it and it makes my hair look less messy! I saw my delivery drivers today and they didn't even notice that I just threw up my hair like I didn't care! LOVE LOVE IT! Thank you.

",0.99188792739,fashion,"Love it. Adds so much volume and thankfully matches my hair color almost perfectly!
",0.99089086139,fashion,"Time saver!!Super easy to use. I just act like it’s a regular pony tail when I put it in. I usually make my hair into a bun then put this in. I wrap it once normal then the second wrap I split my own bun into two parts and have this go in between, if that makes sense.No one has noticed it’s fake. Been wearing it over a month.Also, this thing has saved me a couple of times when I was really short on time to get ready. I was able to throw together a cute hair style very quickly. WAY faster than if I was only styling my real hair. If your hair is longer and / or thicker, you will likely prefer two of these.

",0.95536279739,fashion,"I have long fine straight hair that I like to wear up. I used my messy bun scrunchie for a quick fix for my hair on a rainy day shopping.I  still looked put together even though I was in and out of the rain all day.
",0.83457410339,fashion,"I got from this messy hair piece. I like to use this scrunchie on days when I don't want to wash my hair. I first made a low side bun and then twisted the hair scrunchie twice around my bun. I used a few bobby pins to hold it in place and to shape it how I wanted it to look and then put on my baseball cap. It matches my hair color perfect. I ordered 2 pcs. I took these photos in different lighting so you could see the true color. It looks like real hair. I comb it gently once I take it off and keep it in the bag it came in. I've only had a few hairs fall out but that is expected. I haven't needed to wash it yet but if I do I will probably let it air dry. I've also worn it without a baseball cap and it looks very real. I prefer using bobby pins to help shape it up and tame it down a little. I am thinking of purchasing another one to keep for later. You won't be disappointed!
",0.773853639,fashion,"These are really cute!!! I use this when I get up in the morning (or anytime lol) and don't have time to style my hair. As other reviewers have mentioned, it has some amazing ability to blend with your hair. It's not too shiny to look real, and not one time have I had anyone question it's authenticity, and I work at a high school lol. When I pulled it straight up on top of my head, a lady at church asked me if I had been to a wedding or something and had an updo. I really like it and was absolutely worth the price to have a simply hair style that looks nice and stylish.I love this pretty hairpiece
",0.9524480740,fashion,"Awesome sweater, I sized up for a looser fit and I’m glad I did. Important to note on color- the camel color is definitely not camel, it’s a more of a tan.

",0.9545059240,fashion,"Ordered this sweater because of the price and because it is very hard to find a mock neck sweater, I usually wear a medium but got a large. Glad I did. I don’t like a tight sweater.It is quite long and I did have to cuff the sleeves. That is normal for me, though. So far I am very impressed. It is not heavy but still warm and cozy, so soft and doesn’t cling to the body. The test, for me, will be if it gets pills under the arm. Would love to order more but am waiting to see how it wears. The neck is so comfortable! I can not do a tight neck anymore. This is perfect!

",0.540,fashion,"Very nice light weight sweater. Great for under vests, shrugs, cardigans, or alone. I love the mock neck, it looks dressy but isn't overly tight. I have short arms so I love the cuffs on the sleeves.
",0.83799815241,fashion," This seemed like a good deal so I bought a pack to potentially send to my guy friend. When they arrived, I saw the S was true to size so it actually fit me! I put the shirt on and the pants seem like they would fit too. Here's the rundown:They are very light thermals. The shirt could be worn on its own and look good or be layered with a light cardigan. The microfiber/fleece is very thin and unobtrusive. The shirt has decent stretch.The pants on the other hand have insane stretch. I posted a video and the waistband looks like it could encompass a few sizes.With cold weather here, I think this is a really flexible set that would be a good purchase or gift.
",0.89535951641,fashion," Had some trouble getting this thanks to it being left at the wrong house. Luckily the neighbor was nice enough to bring it over but not before ripping into the package.  Anyway!  Glad I got these.  They are super comfy, incredibly soft and very warm!  I bough these for my husband, in a medium but I tried it on too ( since I’m always freezing) and well I’ve basically taken the black set as mine!  I have to say they are a snug fit!!!  I am a ladies large and he is a medium, but he said the grey set get much more snug then the black one but both fit well enough for under clothes or even as pajamas should he decide to do that.  They are so warm and soft I honestly will see if I can buy just the tops for myself since As I said I am always cold.  They have like a seamless smooth look and are perfect for layering up.
",0.85156494441,fashion," I got this set for my husband. We both love it. I want to get the women's version now. The material is very soft, stretchy, and warm. They're perfect for base layers under clothes as they're lightweight but warm, polyester material. They are true to size. My husband is 6'2 and 180lbs...very long limbs and the sleeves and pants were long enough! He is always a large, and I ordered a large. The pants appeared too short initially, but we were surprised to find how stretchy they were and fit him perfectly down to the ankles. Great, moisture wicking material. They came very nicely packaged in a sealed bag. Great value for the price!
",0.86805152941,fashion,"Got these for my husband for the harsh winters we get around here. His body has some pretty serious reactions to the cold, so it is important to keep him warm. Even just going to and from work, and while he is at work and gets a lot of the door and window air hitting him while he is sitting at his desk, is challenging. We looked carefully at the measurements and decided XL would be the best for his needs. Ignore their sleeve measurements. My husband wears a 34/35 sleeve and these were plenty long enough. They are fleece lined, making them extremely comfortable. He said he did not get overheated in them but felt so comfortable in them all day he could sleep in them. They wash easily. I air dry them though to make sure they don't shrink. We haven't tested them on a full 50 degrees below zero day, but from what I hear about this winter, I am sure we will get that opportunity soon enough. Meanwhile, they are holding strong.
",0.74928468541,fashion,"Perfect size small fit! They’re snug, but that’s expected of thermals so they can fit under clothes. So, I had my husband use these for a few days. I was honestly expecting it to take more time, but he’s worn the shirt, at least, every single day since we received it and has continued to bomb me with information as to why he loves them. His comments as I complain that I’m freezing is to put on the other thermals because they’re so WARM! He’s also said he likes these much better than Under Armor. “It keeps you warm, it keeps your core warm, but it’s airy. It’s like, you’re warm but you’re not sweating” his quote on it. He also said it speaks a ton that he’s worn one three days in a row. When I told him the price he was shocked! He gives it a 10/10 and I’m off to wear the other set because my ass is cold.
",0.83273434641,fashion," I got these for my husband because he needed more thermals for work. He does HVAC so works out in the super cold and wind during this time of year. We also snowboard alot so you can never have to many thermals. These were a good price so I got them. My husband opened them and was shocked how soft they were and after trying them on he was even more shocked because they were so soft and comfortable. He also said they will be great for holding his body heat in. He thought they were so comfortable he made me try them on and even though they were way to big I could see what he was saying so I ordered a pair of the womens immediately.They are 92% ultra soft Polyester and 8%spandex I ordered true to size and they fit my husband great.
",0.88898277341,fashion,"Great fit, doesn’t bind up or restrict as sometimes the waffle type do. The soft lining of fleece is a comfy and warm touch. These are truly warm to wear in extreme cold temperatures.  Tested while wearing on an outdoors job, with temps in the 20’s and windy. So glad to have had these on. Would recommend them. I would also suggest to not dry them in the dryer, or to only dry in the dryer for about ten minutes then hang dry the rest of the time. (I do that with any clothing that has polyester/spandex blend). Helps the longevity of the clothing.
",0.89678901441,fashion," This thermal pants and shirt are great for layering. The cold weather is coming and the two pack is a good deal. I’m 5’3” and weight 125 and the men’s small fit perfectly. The pants were tight enough to wear under ski pants and the shirt loose enough to move around. The is the men’s “front” (think like men’s briefs are designed) in the front so if that bothers you, then maybe a different style. But for me these are perfect. Inside they are soft and outside smooth. I can’t wait for cold weather to arrive. I know these will be exactly what I need to stay warm
",0.88739061441,fashion,"I got this for my 5'11 son.  I accidentally ordered large instead of XL he normally wears.  The large isn't too tight though after washing, it is similar to long underwear shirts/pants.  Will work great for hunting or under clothes in winter.  It isn't tight in waste, and arm sleeves are right at wrist.  He loves how soft it is and says feels like not wearing anything.  Feel great price for the 4 pieces with it being so comfortable and not shrinking in wash!

I kept breaking the temple off and decided enough was enough. I finally upgrade and order a pair that  don't look like Ben Franklin frames.  Theses frames are big enough and look more like the prescription frames I used to wear. The color is what really makes time stand out. Usually when any color is ""tortoise"" there is more black than the color. These frames are a rich combination of navy and a lighter blue, NOT black with blue tortoise. I can wait to show them off. The only reason I did not go e 5 stars is because they did NOT come with a case! They were in a plastic ziploc bag in a box with out any bubble wrap or padding. There was a little scratch but not enough to send back. Packaging for glasses should be more secure.

Although, 10 minutes later my hand started to swell. I’m not allergic to any metals, but it cut off circulation in my finger. I ended up having to go to my school nurse for 2 hours long just trying to get the ring off! (It didn’t work). So I had to go the hospital!!  The first hospital couldn’t cut the ring off Becase the metal was to thick! So we had to go to another hospital, then ended up cutting it off but it took about 4 hours altogether!! Since the ring was constantly rubbing on my skin, I have an infection. I have to now use an antibiotic on my finger. In the end, my hospital bill was as much as a REAL Cartier ring. DEFINITELY ORDER SIZE UP, I’m very mad and DONT RECCOMEND THIS BRAND.
",0.04582798543,fashion,"Will be returning. Runs very small (although I ordered 3 sizes larger than usual. I’m very petite with tiny hands btw). The ‘screw’ detail is not very detailed at all, causing it to look VERY cheap and fake. I do not recommend this product as the sizing is off and not Cartier ‘dupe’. However, the ring is heavyweight and seems to be made out of decent materials.

The width/band of this band is also thinner than other ""love rings"" I've bought on Amazon. The other rings I've bought are thicker in width and look more like the real deal. The screw imprints on this ring are also lower quality and not clear. I do not recommend, there are better alternatives on Amazon for this ring.

",0.87133926245,fashion,"I first ordered these pants in navy blue -- I thought the price was too good to be true so I only ordered this color to see how I liked them and how they fit before getting them in additional colors.  They fit perfectly and are beyond comfortable.  I love the fact that you can order them in the precise length and in every 1 inch increment - -That is unusual and lets me order them knowing I don't have to get them tailored (shortened by an inch or so which adds $15 onto my cost).  I just ordered them in 2 more colors --- Just an outstanding value and a great looking pair of 5 pocket pants --- I would give 6 stars if it was an option
",0.95419985145,fashion,"This is my first review on Amazon but I felt I should give these pants their due since I have been searching for a good 5-pocket pant for a while now.I was looking for a pant that has a bit of stretch but doesn't look shiny or feel to synthetic, and fit me comfortably.For comparison, I've tried Dockers, Lululemon, prAna, Public Rec, etc.These pants are exactly what I was looking for and at an attractive price point. I just received these today so I cannot speak for their longevity yet but the fit is pretty spot on.I feel like I am somewhat of an average build but I always seem to have trouble with pants as some company's regular/straight fits end up being so tight on my legs that they might as well be slim/skinny fit and that was not what I am looking for. I also do not want to feel like I am wearing MC Hammer baggy pants either. These straight fit pants give me enough room in the thigh and lower leg.Depending on the brand I can wear a 32, 33, or 34 waist pant and a 30 or 32 inseam. With these I bought the 34-30s, 33-32's, and 32-31's and I found that the 32-31's were the best fit so that is why I rated these to fit a bit larger than expected but honestly this could go for any pant depending on the manufacturer.The color is very crisp and as all mostly cotton material I do expect the color to fade a bit, but honestly I prefer that to having pants look like I just pulled them from the rack.I am going to be buying the khaki and green color-ways as well.Long story short, if you are looking for a pant that isn't too tight or too baggy, with some great color-ways, then I would definitely recommend giving these a shot.
",0.23102402745,fashion,"What first attracted me to these were they came in a 28"" length.  I have a 32"" waist and normally have to get my pants hemmed.  So first the waist and length was right on.Regarding the material I kind of was expecting a ""denim"" feel.  But these are smoother and a tad thinner.  When I first opened them I wondered about the quality.  But when I put them on, they felt nice and really comfortable.  While they don't have that heavy duty feel of a heavy denim, they are very comfortable.These I think have %2 spandex with cotton, and that makes these give at the knees, waist and thighs when you move about.  A solid denim pant wil not do this as well.  This is one of the reasons they are so comfortable.  Because of the smoothness of the material, they will pass for a casual/dress pant as well and actually look better than denim.
",0.84438371745,fashion,"These were not as I hoped.  I wear a 38 or 40 waist depending on the brand and 30-32 length.  The 38x30 I ordered fit best, but it still felt sort of big in the legs.  Was hoping for a more slimmer fit I guess.  The material was nice.  But ultimately wasn't a good fit for my body.

I had something similar on another pair of shoes but they had a a sliding button thing to tighten and loosen the elastic laces. I like the look of these better. Be sure when you lace them up to go through the strap on the tounge that keeps the tounge from sliding around. After you put the metal end on you can't go back and fix without unknotting the shoe lace and removing the metal clasp. I was afraid they would feel too tight or too loose but I think I got them just right. I did make them a little too loose at first and then took off a little more to get them adjusted to where they are now.

",0.91517913351,fashion,"A little backstory here... my wife and I bought our son a new wallet a few weeks ago as a replacement to one that he lost.  He wanted a slim wallet, so I got him one that didn't fold.  The problem with that is everything sits right on top of everything else and he didn't like it... He wanted a bi-fold.  Long story short, I let him search for one that he liked.  Of course he picked a super expensive one, so we set a dollar limit for him and let him search again, he found this.  He picked the brown one which is actually a pretty cool finish.  It's kind of rustic looking and he likes stuff like that.  I looked it over before he ran off with it and I really like it also.  I've been searching for a new wallet for myself, but I'm very picky about what I carry.  I was going to order one of these for myself today, but they are out of the brown.  Added to my watch list and I'll be back!
",0.19100615451,fashion,"Great wallet! My favorite feature is the card pockets on the front which allows quick access to important cards.The pictures I took show show the wallet with 15 cards and 20 bills so you can get a feel for how bulky it is with alot in it. Despite being loaded with 15 cards, it still holds a slim profile (see pictures). The leather appears of high quality and it comes very nicely polished so looks impressive for those working in a professional setting. The seems look sewn very well which is important because most wallets fail because of threads coming loose. Great quality for the price paid since it is a premium wallet at a reasonable price.
",0.967682651,fashion,"My partner does not like thick wallets, so I bought this because the reviews mentioned that it was a thinner wallet and they were right. This wallet is exactly what he was looking for. It has plenty of room for several cards, a visible ID pocket, and fits money great. The front has a pocket for cards that are used frequently and the whole wallet is RFID proof, so it is extremely safe. It also is made out of a very durable material, and should last a long time. He loves it so far and wants to buy a few as gifts because of how good the price is.
",0.94905471851,fashion,"I have a wallet but it is fat but now I got tin wallet still I can keep all my cards and everything in this wallet ,First of all, as others mentioned, the packaging was extremely nice. The wallet itself is good quality. I was converting from an old trifold that was badly in need of replacement, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much storage this wallet had for my insurance cards, rewards cards, credit cards and things like my fishing license and concealed carry permit. Wasn't quite big enough to fit my work ID, but that's because it's laminated and it fit nicely in one of the credit card slots. I took out a few things I realized I never used, but I was amazed with how much thinner and more comfortable this wallet was with almost the same amount in it.
",0.83242034951,fashion,"Without any cards, the wallet is pretty slim, a little bit taller than my iphone (see picture). With cards in place, the wallet can get close to twice the height of the iphone. The wallet is a bit wider than I would like, but it's not too big to fit into my pockets. The capacity is large; I'm able to fit at least 10 cards into the wallet. The cards fit nicely into the pockets and don't easily fall out. In fact, the card fits so snug, it is not quite that easy to pull out using the thumb hole on the outside. However, the thumb hole on the inside of the wallet is much easier to push cards out. The wallet material feels nice and smooth and I like the carbon black pattern. In addition, this wallet has the RFID blocking security to help keep your credit card safe, which is a nice feature.
",0.2188841451,fashion,"I've been looking for a new wallet for a while as everything I had was either too big (traditional wallet) or too small (3 cards only, no cash) and I really needed something in the middle for everyday use. I've had this for about a week now and can confidently say it meets my needs.On the outside are slots for 2 ""quick access"" cards including a thumbhole to help slide on out easy. This is where I keep my every day credit card. On the inside there's an ID card window (or something else if you prefer) and several additional card slots. Personally, this is just the right number for me as I have room for my debit card, business card, and a spare slot depending on what my plans are for the day.Lastly, there's ample room for cash (without going overboard) which allows me to keep a handful of bills unhand whenever needed.I've enjoyed using this enough that I've put my other wallets away and think I'll be sticking with this type for quite a while.
",0.87993586151,fashion,"This wallet doesn't feel bulky at all. 6 cards in my other wallet makes it feel thick. But this wallet didn't feel that way at all.It's made of leather with a nice carbon fiber pattern imprinted on it. No reason why the imprint won't last as long at the wallet, unless you're constantly rubbing the side of the wallet out of habit. It has all the regular nooks and crannies that wallets have. There's no card flap, but that's the norm for a slim wallet. Instead, there are 2 outer slots for commonly used cards.This is a good redesign on the old billfold design. I prefer this to a clip wallet, and it feels just as thin.
",0.73664498351,fashion,"Very well made, bright color, thin as advertised and worth the money!!This wallet is exactly what I was looking for.Iam tired  of the big bulky wallets especially the trifold ones.It has plenty of room for several cards, a visible ID pocket, and fits money great. The front has a pocket for cards that can be for your ID card or mostfrequently  used ones .It is an RFID proof, soi believe it is extremely safe. It also is made out of a very durable material,great colors and hopefully it will last long. I very much liked the front slot to slide the cards to thaka them out.So far so goo d and can't wait to start using it.with the festival's around , I think this Would be a great gift for friends and family members.
",0.97228360251,fashion,"I hate big and bulky wallet because it is the ugliest thing in the side pocket and a literal “pain in the butt” when sitting down. For many years I have tried to minimize the number of credit cards I want to keep in the wallet so I always like slim wallet.This wallet came in with a nice box and carefully wrapped (can be a wonderful gift this Christmas). The leather is premium to touch, though I doubt it is genuine leather but I don’t really care for genuine leather anyway. This wallet can hold up to 5 cards (3 inside and 2 outside) but one of the slot inside can’t really fit in anything really (see picture). Also, you can carry some cash as well but it does make the wallet significantly thicker. I really like the 2 slots for credit cards located outside of the wallet because it is very convenient and easily accessible. I keep my most frequently used credit cards in there and the cutouts help to remove the credit cards easier.Bottom line: a nice, slim, minimal wallet for people who hate bulky wallet.
",0.77177178951,fashion,"I recently bought this wallet after some low life POS decided to steal mine at a restaurant. After looking around at the typical stuff I buy, I decided to spend a little more money and go with this masterful artwork. I LOVE this wallet. I can not attest to its longevity yet, but to start with the company has taken great care in the packaging process. It comes in its own personal gift box, inside of that the wallet is in a nice pouch that is a perfect fit for the wallet. Opening that, the wallet itself is nicely wrapped in a cloth bag to keep the finish of the leather. Now when you remove that cloth bag be prepared. The leather is a super light weight soft piece of art. I am still not used to how nice it feels to hold it when I pay for things. I did not ever dream that holdiong a wallet would make me smile, but here we are. I HIGHLY recommend this product! 10/10

I tried wearing woolen socks, compression socks, regular socks. while woolen socks are comfortable, they didn't do much, moreover they were a bit rough on feet. Compression socks didn't help either and actually made my feet uncomfortable.I found these socks and bought them assuming that these somehow generate heat. I realized that it's not anything like that. It is even better, it has no electric components, no batteries, no wires. So very safe to use.These socks trap heap normally produced by body to keep your feet warm. They don't let cold air enter your feet there by retaining the heat. My feet don't feel sweaty as well in these.It looks like regular woolen socks from outside, but has fleece like lining inside. So it is both comfortable and functional. I am not sure if these are waterproof but  they worked in sub zero temperatures as well. I sometimes go for a walk with these on with my shoes.

I weigh 145 pounds, wear size small in shirts and size 7 in junior pants and the pj set fit true to size other than the waistband feeling restricting. The material is soft and well made but I would say that the material is kind of thin for Christmas PJs which for me means that they would be worn during the winter season and I live in Michigan so we get alot of snow in the winter. I would like the material to be a little thicker that is the reason I gave it four stars and the waist band fitting tighter than usual.

",0.81246924457,fashion,"I mean, it does what I want, covers my wobbly bits and is comfy like a nightdress which is all I really ask of clothing these days as I sink further into slovenly mid-life house wifery.  It is a bit thinner than I hoped for, not even as thick as most teeshirts. and the print isn't as vibrant and deep navy as the picture shows. But the dress is well made, flattering and comfy so really, for this price, it is fine and I would buy again perfectly happily.
",0.84678268457,fashion," Ordered this to wear to work and it exceeded my expectations!  Perfect length, high-quality, and the print was amazing! The snow leopard can be worn with any black cardi or vest to elevate the look for a night-out! The scoop-neck is modest and the fit is flattering! Great with tights and booties or leggings and flats! A great option for layering, too.  This is a size Small and fits true to size.

",0.91103142557,fashion,"This is a fine t-shirt dress, but it's nothing special.  I ended up sending it back because I need more pieces in my wardrobe that are better than just okay.
",0.88873851357,fashion,"I love this dress. It fits well, launders easily and travels great. I bought it for an out of state wedding, so I needed something that was low maintenance. I am 5'7"" and average shaped. I bought an XL and it fit great. The dress is very soft and comfortable. Highly recommend!
",0.84301465758,fashion,"This size was exact. These underwear are so soft and comfortable. They do provide comfort around the midsection. I love them so much, I bought more.

",0.88491475658,fashion,"I finally found underwear that fits my full bottom and do not ride up.  These are soft and comfortable.  From running, exercising, bike riding and just walking around these stay in place.  The underwear is movable as well.  No matter what I am doing they curve with my body and are not stiff.  The colors are cute and fun.  I was worried the waist band would press into my stomach but it is elastic enough that it is not an issue.  You can actually roll them down or keep them up.  I am very happy and would buy these again.

",0.94103479458,fashion,"I love these panties. I am trans-androgynous and finding underwear that fits me is pretty much impossible. I was just expecting to receive another pair of underwear that would fit comfortably but I was surprised. these ended up being the most comfortable underwear made for a woman that I own. I love the colors as well, they work well with my outfits and are simply cute. These are the first high waist underwear I own as well and they were not too tight. They have a good level of stretchiness and remain very smooth.

",0.82980871260,fashion,"If you're looking for ""flowy"" then order your regular size.  I'm 5'5, 150 lbs and pear shaped and a Medium fits perfect and covers well below my booty so i can wear it with leggings.  Soft and warm, not cheap looking which I was worried about ordering online.
",0.83718633760,fashion,"Love the way this tunic sweater fits!  I am 5 foot 9 1/2 and it is about the same length as shown on the model.  The sleeves are long enough I actually fold them over twice for a cuff effect.  It is a light-weight fabric, more of a knit, so perfect for the transition from Fall into Winter.  I am a 42DD and the XXL fit perfectly - could probably have gone down one size but want to allow for any shrinkage in washing.  I have gotten several compliments on it and wanting to know where I purchased it!
",0.75339388860,fashion,"Soooo super soft. I ordered the purple, size medium. It is a little larger than I would like, but is still cute with leggings. I am 5’6”, 140 lbs. It is so soft that it feels amazing on.
",0.88077807460,fashion," This is a great tunic top that has the cutest button detail.  I love that it’s perfect for leggings or jeans.  It’s also lightweight enough to wear comfortably under a leather or suede jacket.  For size reference I’m 5’4 and 115 pounds abs normally wear an XS.  I’m wearing a Small and it is a little long in the arm sleeves so I would say it’s TTS.  I did a try on session with this top over on Instagram @EmilySarmo if you want to take a closer look.
",0.95661866760,fashion,"I absolutely love this shirt, it is so soft & comfortable, I don’t want to take it off.  I wore this shirt to a party recently & got so many compliments.  Looks great with both jeans & leggings.  For reference I am 5’4 & weigh 130 lbs, ordered a small, fits perfect!
",0.84870171560,fashion,"This garment was not what I was expecting. I have a plus-size hourglass figure, and this looked like it would flatter me, so I ordered what I thought would be one size up, just in case. But when I tried it on it was too small, too short, draped strangely, and the material was somehow thin and hot at the same time. I will say I loved the color and the fabric was soft. It just wasn't what I was hoping for.
",0.25994366460,fashion,"Very cute sweater for fall. The material is soft, not thick material. I love the neck line and button detail. I am between sizes right now so I went up to a large and it’s perfect, a little loose and baggy but not frumpy.ETA I didn’t notice the first time I tried it on, but the buttons are centered, not asymmetrical like I was anticipating. The top is comfortable and I’ve already washed it, but I lowered my rating from five to four because you get what you pay for...
",0.83222478660,fashion,"Soft and stylish. Perfect for fall. Warm without being bulky. Love it!
",0.97748422660,fashion,"For a medium the sleeves were pretty short. I also ordered a small which actually got better and didn’t seem as short in the sleeves. If in between sizes I’d size down. Doesn’t wash great, looks old after one wash.
",0.2366062460,fashion,"First I want to say this top is soooo soft! However, I’m 5’ 9” tall and I wanted it to be a little longer on me. Being pear shaped it hit me at the widest part of my hips so wasn’t figure flattering. Other than that, great quality and would have been a keeper.
",0.24535453361,fashion,"This is a gorgeous bracelet in rose gold.  My wrist measured 16cm and I purchased this bracelet in size 19cm and it fit me perfectly.  It comes with a screw to open and close this bracelet, which means you won't take this off on a daily basis or spend time each day putting it on and taking it off.  The engraving inside the bracelet is super pretty as well.  It looks exactly like the famous bracelet :)
",0.88489615961,fashion,"I love this bracelet. I got the 19 cm. I have big wrists and can’t wear a lot of bracelets. I like the oval shape. They are a bit hard to get on by yourself. I am able to do it, but it takes patience. I keep the screwdriver (it comes with) in my purse to tighten screws as they come loose. My husband asked me why I got two, I think I need three—maybe more. I love the stacked look. They do have a nice weight to them.
",0.82030379861,fashion,"This is definitely a great look alike. At least enough for me. It is a very secure piece of jewelry and is heavy. The gold is a beautiful color and the diamonds are well placed to look real. I love this!
",0.97758221661,fashion,"It looks super pretty and fits well! The screws are a little bit scratchy if you screw them in all the way, but for the price, I am not complaining at all! Love it
",0.91722023561,fashion,"I bought 3 of the bracelets as gifts. The description stated they arrive in gift boxes and they did not. They arrived in plastic bags (see attached photo). Very disappointed, item did not arrive as described. Once they are worn I'll give updated review on product. I was going to reach out to seller but cant figure out how. I'll also update review if issue got resolved.
",0.23396530761,fashion,"Nice bracelet! It’s a pretty spot-on dupe for the real thing and costs just a fraction of the price! It fit well and is comfortable. A bit tricky to get on by yourself, but I managed. Over all, it’s great! The color is dainty and it seems well made.
",0.95909386961,fashion,"I like this bracelet a lot, it’s a pretty and very comfortable-it’s not completely round, it’s more like an oval, which is more comfortable for me. I was able to try it on myself but it’s definitely easier with help.
",0.95939111761,fashion,"I really liked the bracelet. I would love you have a smaller size. The tool was packed separately and it almost felt out the box. I will see how resistant is and if goes along with my sensitive skin.
",0.81378090461,fashion,"I love it. Arrived on time (only a few days to ship to NJ) Inside is stamped. Screws on and fits perfectly. I have a small wrist so I bought the small and I definitely recommend that one for women. Hasn't changed color and the screws stay put and I wear it 24/7. Beautiful. I recommend the purchase before Amazon tries to take it off lol Worth the money!

But there are Velcro straps to make it smaller. We adjusted the shoulder straps all the way tight. Very durable Material, well made, and she will fit them for a couple seasons. She’s a size 6, and they can fit up to a 7-7x
",0.90617632963,fashion,"These are nice snow pants.  My little girl needed bibs so her snow pants fit better but she’s shorter than the size she needs.  I had to do some shortening to make these fit her.  As I was shortening them I noticed that they are sewn and put together well.  The hem on the bottom was thick and evenly sewn and the insulation seemed thick.The snaps on the bibs work nice and the zipper works easily for my 5 year old to manage at school by herself.There was some fabric with elastic to go over snowboots which is nice to keep snow out of them.
",0.25131434263,fashion,"I bought size M for my 6 year old who is very tall and skinny. It is still a little big but the shoulder straps and waist straps are adjustable so she can definitely wear it and grow in to it more. No need to buy another one for next year. My daughter loves the colors, looks like a unicorn snow suit. It keeps her warm and snow does not get into her boots either. Easy to put on and take off.
",0.77167892563,fashion,"We have not had a chance to test these in action in the snow but from what I’ve seen so far these are among the better pair of snow-bibs I’ve seen, having shopped around a lot in stores. The seat and knees reinforcement are decent but, again, not sure yet how they will hold up in actual use. Zipper pockets are nice, adjustable shoulder and waste straps are nice. There’s a ring which I presume to be for hooking gloves on, which I like as a much hetter option to store gloves when not in use. We ordered purple and pink and the colors are great - the girls both love them in terms of appearance and feel/fit, not that appearance is important especially with snow-bibs. All-in-all I was pleasantly surprised with these, as Amazon name branded attire is new to us and the price point created doubt in what I would get. Not 5 stars because we haven't tested true quality in withstanding kids playing in snow.
",0.93818855363,fashion,"My daughter loves the colors in this Ombré Pink snow bib, and I love the affordable price. The pockets have zippers and the knee is reinforced which appears to be well done. The bottom of the leg has the inner elastic to help keep snow out. We have yet to put them to the test. My daughter is 9 and wears extra large or 16-18 sized clothes. We got the extra large which seems a little big at first but once you put all the layers on under it and adjust the straps and Velcro, should be a good fit. The length was also almost too long but with the under layers and boots it should work great.
",0.81980824563,fashion,"These look great and fit well over boots and under a coat.  My daughter loves the pattern/colors and she’s easy to spot in the snow!
",0.93112444963,fashion,"We haven’t got to put them to some good use yet but so far I love them. They seem well made and from nice fabric. I like the reinforced knees. My kids are really hard on snow pants here in Alaska.
",0.84277820663,fashion,"I had to order a smaller size, but my daughter loves the fun colors. I plan to get the matching jacket. I haven't tested it out in snow yet. Really cute for an excellent price.
",0.82277756963,fashion,"I got these for my 5 year old daughter. We are still in the beginning of the winter season. We had some snow very early this year so I needed them quickly. I got a little bigger of a size for her so they will last all winter and they are quite big. Enough that she will be able to wear them next year also as long as they hold up quality wise. So far so good. Will update more when we've got more into the season!
",0.563,fashion,"Love these bib snow pants! My daughter adores the colors. They’re perfect for snow play, keeping the snow off their stomachs and out of boots. They were a little big for the size she wears but that’s okay, well just kegerator to use them for longer.

I don’t think we will ever worry about them falling out and we have lost so many earrings, even the lock back ones.

The card and plastic that displays/enclose the earrings are cheap looking considering how nice the earrings are.  Aside from that, I have zero complaints.

",0.97917437671,fashion,"I'm 6'5"" and 33"" waist. I'm always stuck trying to decide between shirts/sweaters that are size L (good fit around my torso but too short) and XL (long enough but like I'm wearing a wing suit when I raise my arms).This sweater would probably be fine for someone with average proportions but this XL is basically an XL width with L length...a short wing suit).I know it may be more me & not the sweater that is the issue so I'm not going to trash it's rating. Just writing this to give other tall people a heads up.
",0.16182145571,fashion,"I bought two of these. One for my husband and one for my son. Both of them complained that the material was very scratchy and uncomfortable. Even with a button down shirt underneath neither was willing to wear it. Also, my husband has a slightly longer than average torso and his sweater was about 2 inches shorter than he would have liked, though it fit him well otherwise. Ended up returning both.

",0.09024214771,fashion,"This is a solid sweater. It's a bit lighter than I was expecting but warm enough to keep me comfortable around our chilly house (60-64deg). It's comfortable and soft and fits well. I'm 5.5 and 200 pounds and got the xl. It doesn't look baggy or sloppy but has plenty of room for a shirt or two under it and isn't constricting or tight in the arms like so many women's sweaters are. I knocked off a star because it got a bit felted/fuzzy from washing but it still looks fine and is still comfy. I'd buy it again. It's so hard to find clothes in a solid color without a brand name displayed or anything fancy. This is practical and basic.
",0.88553476371,fashion,"We purchased this sweater for my son to wear for family photos. It fit well and was the correct color but the fabric was SO scratchy that I ended up returning it and buying something else. I think it would be fine if you were wearing a shirt underneath.
",0.79794186471,fashion,"Great blend and value for the money. Fits my 5’ 11” 175# son perfectly even with wider shoulders and long torso. Room enough for a shirt underneath. Better blend and value than gap or Macy’s.

My son is 6 months old and these are SLIGHTLY too big for him but I’m sure by the time it’s winter out they will fit perfectly (my son is on the smaller side).  These gloves are thick and super super soft.  I was a little concerned about them being made in China BUT there’s no strange smell to them and the seem like good quality! Will update once winter is closer and my son can enjoy the outside without numb fingers!I did receive these at a discounted price for my review, however my review is genuine and honest. SO EXCITED TO USE THESE MITTENS!!
",0.98071980572,fashion,"I ordered these LAST NIGHT and they arrived TODAY! This was PERFECT timing because the weather went from 90° to 45° overnight like it seen a state trooper. They worked perfectly for my 6 month old hands. He still has room to grow and he has large hands. We went to a pumpkin patch today and when I took the mittens off, his hands were toasty warm. They're super soft and thick and you get two pairs!

",0.81618261372,fashion,"I purchased these gloves for my 10 month old baby.  Winter is coming and with all the outdoor events, these will be very useful.  They’re cute and very soft.  The dark colors make them easily match able to most outfits.  While they are meant for babies, they’re super stretchable, as you can see with my attached photo. That’s my adult hand in it, and it’s nearly able to fit.  So these should work for older babies and toddlers too!  Very pleased with the purchase.
",0.92669910272,fashion,"These are amazing! They are so soft and comfortable that my 15 month old wont even let me take them off! They definitely keep his little hands warm and the colors are fantastic as they are neutral and can match any jacket he wears.

",0.93236255672,fashion,"The gloves (upto 24-month babies) fit my baby perfectly and it feels very warm. The fur feels decent and it does not shed like other gloves. The package comes in 2 pairs with different colors and the colors match the pictures on Amazon perfectly. The outer layers looks like wool.
",0.2382089572,fashion,"I ordered these gloves for my daughter. I love how it comes with 2 sets because with young kids it's so hard to keep track of gloves. They are super soft and the fur is all inside also to help get hands warm. We walk to the bus stop and wait for my son to get dropped off so these gloves will come in handy keeping her warm because she always has cold hands.It's also not easy to take off since I got them in a bigger size so she could wear them longer. I like how you can make them longer if you unfold the fur if you needed too. The fur did have some fall out like you would with anything new with fur. Kinda wish mommy had a pair like her. Hahaha
",0.72988009572,fashion,"These gloves are so cute and poofy! I have a toddler who seems to wear them comfortably. There are two sizes in the set (small; they fit my one year old) and larger (which will definitely come in handy next year when my son is two). It was a bit difficult to fit the thumb inside the glove at first but it’s because my son is not used to wearing gloves (and he kept clenching his fist). Once on, the gloves work great!
",0.18122360173,fashion,"I love the fit, I ordered a Medium  and could have fit the small. I love that it has a design on the front and back like the expensive sweaters in my arsenal from Europe. It holds it own. I received yesterday and wore it today and I received compliments right out the gate. I have been searching the stores for a Black pullover sweater and couldn't find one anywhere this year. I looked on here and after two other popping up first this one came up and I jumped on it. I love the feel and the rich lines. Such a pretty sweater and I intend to purchase other colors soon. This will make a wonderful Christmas gift.

My only complaint is that they squeak but I guess that keeps me aware of where my little gremlin is at all times. She has smaller than average baby feet but these fit perfectly with room to grow.

",0.95388871475,fashion,"Worked out beautifully.  Bought and delivered on time.  The thermals were used for children in a Thanksgiving play.  They were popcorn.
",0.90762543775,fashion,"Good quality of clothing. My daughter loves them!
",0.97103440875,fashion,"I’m an adult female and got these Amazon Essentials Thermal Set in XX-Large for myself. So, I’m sorry, I cannot comment on how the fit is child-wise. But, I guess I can explain how they wear from an adult perspective. These are seriously THE best thermals I have tried. Only problem is the pant tags. They’ll have to be seam ripped out, otherwise the edge from cutting might irritate as well.I’m sorry, I feel bad I cannot leave a review for the girls/boys these are made for. It’s just that I can’t seem to find any adult standard thermals that aren’t either expensive, ill-fitting, low-quality weird fabric and just overall unpleasant. These waffle ones, however, are just PERFECT. Soft, warm, comfortable and just satisfying to wear. Plus the fabric (60% cotton 40% poly) is thin -in a good way- for being so warm! Excellent for PJs or layering under clothing.I’m 5’7”, 115lbs, 32A, 27”Waist, 34”Hip and the XXLarge are on point. I actually could’ve sized down on the pants; bit too loose if I want to wear layer under tighter pants. Great for sleepwear though. The top fits perfect. Not tight or too loose. From researching some child-adult conversion size charts I would say these are true to size.Washed on regular but I air dried them so don’t know about shrinkage.For conventional thermals these are a steal, even for children sizes. I wish adult ones were that cheap. I highly recommend these Amazon Essentials. Their quality has gone up unbelievably. Children will never want to take these off, you may have to buy a pair for every day of the week! And at this price I don’t think that’d be a problem.Ultimately, they’re well-made, fit appropriately, warm and cozy and an excellent value. Everything you could ask for in a conventional thermal set. I’m about to order one in each color. Will have to check if the same ones are available in adult sizes. Amazon Essentials wins again!
",0.13058480675,fashion,"So these are labeled as girls, and they’re the exact same as the boys set (which are a few $ cheaper). These fit on my 6.5 year old son (48” tall, 50#). The pants are a bit loose in the waist, but are close to the body throughout the legs, there are cuffs at the leg openings. The shirt is kind of longer on him, and flows nicely on him. He’s comfortable to sleep in these, and they aren’t too hot for him. The shirt is versatile enough that it can be worn underneath a short sleeve shirt for extra layers. He wore this under his Halloween costume, and was quite comfortable. I do like these enough that I’m purchasing more in smaller sizes for my other kids. I washed these on a cold cycle and dried them without issue.Medium size (8)60% cotton, 40% polyesterMade in Cambodia
",0.67484742475,fashion,"This is a very nice thermal set. The material is soft and comfortable and has a little stretch to it. My daughter is able to move freely in them and thinks they are comfortable. I think they do a good job of keeping her warm. They llook well made and the material feels like it is good quality. They will be good this winter to use as an extra layer and even as pajamas. I like the wide elastic band on the ankles and wrists, as a layering piece they really help them stay in place.As far as sizing goes, I think they run true to size. My daughter is almost 5 and wears a small or extra small in girls clothes, we got her a small and it fits her as we expected, a little big with room to grow into them. We like that they are pretty neutral, they could easily be used for a boy or girl.Overall we are happy with this set. She will get a lot of use out of them this winter. They are good quality, comfortable and warm. Thanks for reading this and please do let me know if this is helpful, feel free to leave a comment below if you have any questions or would like to see new pictures and I will do my best to answer it. Thank you, cheers. Cass
",0.99782729175,fashion,"We ordered these for our 11 year-old daughter who received the package, took one look at these and excitedly said ""Mom and Dad!  My new pajamas came!""  She loves them.  She's worn them the past two nights because it's been cold and she said they kept her really warm and were comfortable.We are really starting to love the Amazon Essentials brand.  The quality is great and so is the cut of the pieces.  And the quality.  It's usually not too cold here in California but we're also whimps when it comes to being cold so we need these - especially if we go to the snow.  They also make great pajamas when we don't want to run the heater all night (which can make your sinuses dry up!)The quality of these is great.  They're really soft, comfortable, and manufactured well.  The fabric is nice, they're cut well and have been assembled and stitched well.  They're made out of waffle fabric as most thermals are.The only pet peeve I have about these are the tags.  When, oh when, will manufacturers stop putting tags in things.???  We always remove them - and they're so uncomfortable for anyone wearing the clothes.  This set has several tags that had to be removed.Otherwise, we give these two thumbs up - highly recommend them - we may even purchase another set!  We hope this review has helped your decision making!  Have a wonderful day!
",0.83800101375,fashion,"The thermals set fits my 12 year old daughter perfectly. Remember that these thermals are stretchy and has a wide tolerance. It's getting very cold in the Midwest this year and she needed some new thermals. These Amazon Essentials thermals are very warm! She said it's great to have them when she's outside, but it got too warm wearing them at school. The school keeps their heat on too high.In my opinion, Amazon Essentials seems like the higher quality version of Amazon Basics. So far I have been happy with their products and this is no exception. It's made of quality materials and it doesn't feel cheap. Most importantly, these thermals truly keep my daughter warm.
",0.575,fashion,"This is another win for Amazon Essentials.  We don't often get super cold weather here in Louisiana, but every once in a while it happens.  Unless you're doing something outdoors (like fishing or camping), you may not need long johns.  But they do make fantastic winter pajamas!These are a nice quality.  They are super soft and finished well (or as you'd expect long johns to be finished), and made of that waffle fabric.  The price is fantastic!I do have one minor gripe, and it's not limited to this garment: Why oh why do clothing makers insist on putting a novella's worth of tags on a garment?  This one (the pants) have 3 rather large tags on the waistband of the bottoms.  Obviously you can't leave them in there, but often when you cut them you leave a jagged, itchy remnant.  Can we ban that?  Please?
",0.17637404875,fashion,"This is a perfect basic thermal set for toddlers. Unisex, in my opinion and fit true to size. I was happy to see it available in this size because I spent all winter last year trying to find a set to fit my tot with no luck. The stores only carried big kids and up, so the smallest I could find was an XS which was still way too big. Having this size available online was a winner in my book!!It washed and dried well, absolutely no shrinkage or compromise to the material or color. The arms and legs have nice elastic cuffs, aiding in keeping the warmth contained nicely. They aren’t bulky and can fit comfortably under regular pants and/or snow pants. I think they are priced fairly, considering how hard they are to find.
",0.79050517175,fashion,"These are great layering pieces for colder weather. We've also used these thermal underwear as pajamas. They're warm and comfortable. They fit just as I expected, and the quality is good. My daughter really likes them.

",0.75999081176,fashion,"Cute sweater, seemed really good quality and it wasn’t super thick but also not too thin. My problem with this was the color- I ordered burgundy, but what arrived was a sweater with an identity crisis. Is it purple? Is it brown? Whatever it was trying to be wasn’t burgundy. It was just really dull and blah and awful. I’d be happy with it in any other color but that I think.

",0.93732559777,fashion,"I normally wear a XL. I am 5'7 and 170lb's. Going by other reviews and I like a little oversized, especially when it's off the shoulder, I ordered a XXL. The fabric was soft and stretchy, but because of the band around the bottom that wasn't elastic it kept the top from form fitting. It looked like I had this huge black and white tent on.I would order your normal size.  This top says it's made in china but it would seem after years of having their stuff returned with complaints of being doll-sized, they finally adjusted to American sizes.
",0.577,fashion,"Y’all this shirt so cute! The buffalo plaid is adorable,  the fit is pretty true to size,  I’m between a small and medium and went for the medium.  It’s loose fitting but the perfect transition piece into fall! Def worth the buy 💕💕

",0.84542208978,fashion,"I like the look and feel and thickness of this cardigan, but the sleeves are a little longer than expected and kind of bunch up near the wrists. I haven’t put it in the dryer because although it would probably tighten up the sleeves, I fear it would shrink up the length of the sweater. It sits just below the belt. If the cardigan were longer I would’ve assumed it was just oversized, but it seems like the sleeves are just disproportionate.My wife said it’s not something that’s visually noticeable, but I can feel the bunchiness when I’m typing or writing at work.
",0.04703214878,fashion,"I ordered XL because sometimes the arms can run short since I'm 6'4. When I tried it on it was really baggy. Arms for but it was too loose. I don't recommend this cardigan whatsoever, low quality.
",0.10860490878,fashion,"Oddly shaped sweater. This is one of the weirdest shaped cardigan sweaters I have ever had. Beware this is extremely short. Length wise mine ends above my belt and I took my normal size. I am not sure who this was made for it is very oddly designed.
",0.07691711278,fashion,"The cardigan fits perfectly. The material is not thick enough for winter wear, but it is the perfect thickness for those chillier days during the fall and early spring. I bought one in the black color and another in grey. They both have the same plastic metallic-grey buttons, which look nice. The material seems to attract lint, so make sure you have a lint roller handy. All in all if you are looking for a light/medium cardigan on a budget, this sweater is for you.
",0.9119005278,fashion,"I'm a woman who originally purchased this sweater for myself cause I wanted a cheap, slouchy cardigan sweater. This sweater is exactly what I was looking for. It's very comfy, keeps me warm, the fabric breaths so I'm not sweating in it, and I don't have to worry about it shrinking in the wash like wool. I get lots of compliments on it, as does my boyfriend when he wears it over a t-shirt. The XS size fits me very loosely but fits him perfectly and his is 5'9 and about 180 lbs. I'm buying this in more colors.

This item would definitely fetch more money at a big department store. Exceptional value. Now we'll see if he will actually wear said cardigan. :)
",0.98571884678,fashion,"This sweater is warm but not heavy, has 5 sturdy buttons and is well made (it comes with a spare button sewn in the left-side wash-care label). Although I usually wear a Medium size, I selected Large to make it a bit loose and comfortable.  It feels great wearing it outdoors at 60 F and yet it's thin enough that can be used as a layer in colder temperatures under a heavier coat. I also like the fact that it does not wrinkle easily and has 2 pockets.

",0.07030892479,fashion,"It seems like a great hoodie, but  no one would answer my questions about it before  I purchased. The sleeves are not lined with sherpa ( which I asked two times) Everything else is sherpa inside. Heavy nice hoodie! Appears true to size, but it's a gift so I'll know after Christmas!
",0.84295237179,fashion,"Maybe look else where. It is not a good fit if you are tall or have long arms. If you have a belly there is plenty of room around your stomach and back. There is no length. I like to think I am an average built guy and got an XL for a lose fit. I move my arm and the sleeves go up my forearms. I also can't move without my shirt get pulled up.
",0.15741026479,fashion,"I typically buy large sweatshirts because I most often layer underneath.  I ordered large in the sherpa lined shirt and find it to be, on first wearing, snug.  I won't have a problem adding a layer underneath, but it's certainly less roomy than my normal hoodies.  That is not a complaint.  I suspect that, a year from now, the lining will compress some and give a good, warm, layering option.  It's a good shirt and I'll wear it a lot when the mercury drops just a bit more.UPDATE:  The temps dropped this morning to 40°, the day after receiving this, so I wore it on a 4-mile early morning walk as a test.  With my normal layering on, it was really too warm for comfort.  So I tried with one less layer, removing a brushed fabric long-sleeve shirt.  With one warm layer less, but still a thin long-sleeve and tee, the sweatshirt was quite comfortable.  Basically, the sherpa lining makes up for one warm layer.As for fit, it was a bit snug with the full layering, but not uncomfortable.

I was concerned about the sizing, but it is true to size! I am 5’8” and 170 pounds. The extra large was a little baggy, but I wanted it oversized. The large is a perfect fit (I ordered a large for my friend, and I tried her’s on).2. The fabric is a cotton polyester blend, so there is no wrinkling. It is smooth and very soft. The fabric is light but not thin.3. Sleeves can be an issue (too tight or short). But, the sleeves were perfect. They are comfortable and hit at my wrists.4. The color is vibrant and the hues are lovely. The colors compliment jeans, dress pants, tights, etc. The style is classier than a tee-shirt without sacrificing the comfort of a tee-shirt.

I got this item in a small and it runs great! It is not tight and not baggy. It's super flattering and hides all tummy poofs! Love this shirt and I'm thinking about buying a new one for my sister. The order came in pretty quickly from when I ordered it.

",0.98468029583,fashion,"I got the white and bronze leopard pattern. It's more of an orange-ish rust colored bronze - like a tiger. But I like it a lot. Its primarily polyester so the colors won't fade and shrinkage shouldn't occur. It's an perfect Fall weight and can be paired with a jacket or cardigen in winter. The body of the top is not fitted so anyone can wear it comfortably. But the look is nice, not too loose or dumpy. I'll be able to wear it for all sorts of fun, it has a certain panache to it.
",0.95244628283,fashion,"This print is very in style right now and I was glad to find an affordable fall shirt! I got long sleeves and it is a polyester cotton blend so it will definitely be better for colder weather. I normally wear a small but wanted a looser fit so ordered a medium.

",0.96704685784,fashion,"I love this sweater! Super cute, soft and just fun! This material is definitely a sweater material but it's NOT heavy. It's like a lighter weight/thinner sweater material. Runs HUGE. I'm 5'7 and wear a 10 in denim and Medium on top. I'm wearing a Medium here and it is massive! Fits like an XL or bigger. But I do love the way it fits! Just a fun oversized/slouchy fit! You could definitely size down though! This could even be worn as a dress buttoned up! Follow me on FB @kindasortalife for more Amazon reviews!
",0.96664023484,fashion," This sweater is so nice !! It’s soft and comfortable and the fabric feels high quality. It runs a little big- would probably size down unless you want it a little big. Love this sweater !
",0.82675886284,fashion,"Love this! I've been on the hunt for a great leopard cardigan that wasnt too warm toned more neutral colored and this is it! The apricot is more of a muted taupe which I really like. It will go with a ton of things and even transition throughout the seasons well. Its slightly heavier than expected which makes it  warm and cozy. Has good stretch as well. Also I didn't realize but it has pockets as well which i love! It's long enough (at least on my body type) to cover my butt so it will be great with leggings. The only thing I'd say that is a ""negative"" is the arms are pretty long but it's not a big deal to me. I still really love this sweater. Its exactly what I've been looking for.Fits TTSReference I'm 5ft 185lbs 36H size L/XL in tops
",0.90764790884,fashion,"The intensity of my love of this sweater is a bit too much. I have now written an amendment into my will that I want to be buried in it. I have also commissioned a smaller version be made for both my Little Weiner dogs so they can feel spectacular!!!Put on some overly large sunglasses and a sun hat and look amazing even if your hair and makeup doesn't. Or if you are wearing sweat pants and flip flops, just find a belt and some hoop earrings and you can get away with murder!So.... I think I like it. I've named mine Berry St Clair and I will buy a few others for Berry to party with 😉
",0.95576357884,fashion,"Size is bit like an over-fit. It looks just like the description picture,and it is a good gift deal. I gave it to my sister. This is a current trendy pattern/designin the fashion industry, and it meets my trend needs. It is affordable price, and materialis like any other sweater material. Very soft, and comfortable to wear.  My sister specially llikes this kind of leopard design, and it matches well with any kind of shirts that she wears.Overall, I feel satisfied over this product's quality. Good
",0.97352641884,fashion,"I love the  print and color (khaki)of this sweater. It is a nice mid weight sweater that will be great as a fall jacket. When ordering this sweater I knew it would be oversized but I did not expect it to be as large as it is. I ordered a small and it is huge, the sleeves are a good 6 inches too long. I feel like I'm playing dress up, I suggest sizing down.  The sweater is made well and looks like it will hold up to wearing and washing well.
",0.90513187684,fashion,"This is a nice cardigan. I like the pockets and buttons, and nothing looks cheap about it. The color is accurate (khaki/black leopard) and it is soft and cozy. My only issue is that it is huge. I mean HUGE! I ordered a small and I am 5'5""/132# about a 36B. I checked to see if I could order it in an XS but it is not available. I feel like I am avg height/weight but if a small is huge on me then anyone more petite would be swallowed up. If I keep I will wear more like a sweater dress with leggings or opaque tights. Comes to my knees and is baggy. Nice quality but again, better for a taller person (over 5'8"" IMO)
",0.82915073684,fashion,"This sweater is so universal it works for every occasion! The quality it great it can easily be dressed up, but it’s so soft it’s also perfect for chilly mornings at home. This is an XL and it fit me nicely, I wish it was a little more oversized but I am plus size (size 16/18) and it fits me without looking small! This is the color apricot and it is so pretty and a soft beige-y color. It contrasts so nicely with leggings or black or dark wash jeans making it perfect for fall. I was surprised how thick and nice the material was for being an “Amazon sweater” but it is so warm and will be perfect for Fall and Winter down here in the South! Cheetah is super in trend right now and I’m in love with this purchase!
",0.91809207284,fashion,"True to size and nice thick material, cute print. I bought an XL and it fits like a L/XL. Nice length - soft and warm. I was expecting something much cheaper and scratchier but I was pleasantly surprised.
",0.95019286985,fashion," I wore these while in Chicago and was able to withstand the freezing temps. I am always cold, ALWAY. where this under one layer of clothes & my parka kept me snug & warm. This thermal is so warm I cannot even believe it. I am always so cold I wear triple quadruple layers to stay warm as someone who is petite and with very little body thought this thermal has been a lifesaver I wear this underneath my jeans you can't even tell that they're there and they fit perfectly like I said I'm petite so it's hard finding clothes that fit but these fit amazingly.
",0.10316839885,fashion," I can not say enough good things  about these thermals. They are literally amazing! I originally had bought my husband the men ones because he needed more pairs since he works outside during the winter time. He got his and after trying them out would not stop ranting and raving about how comfortable and warm they were. We are leaving for a trip to CO soon so decided to buy me some for the trip. Once I received them I tried them on and wow! They are amazingly comfortable, fit great and will definitely keep me warm. They are soft and stretchy. What makes them even better is I can wear the bottoms as leggings and the tops like normal tops. The price was fantastic for 2 pairs too. I am so glad I stumbled upon these and bought them for my husband,myself and my girls.
",0.9819401585,fashion," So I really like this set.  It’s a great price for 2 sets of long underwear.  The inside material is super soft and not itchy at all.  It won’t shrink.  I am 5’4 and 148lbs.  A little pudgy.  I typically don’t buy sets of clothes because the shirts are always too short.  I thought I’d give these a try and ordered an XL so the shirt would be long enough and I could wear it under T-shirt’s comfortably.  I was really surprised that the pants fit me too.  I love the length of the shirt and the pants fit good, maybe a bit Iong but fit everywhere else great.  I took pics wearing different colors so you could see the length of the shirt and fit of the pants,  this will be my go to company for long underwear from now on.
",0.89165097585,fashion," This thermal set is so nice. I'm 5'7 and 130lbs and ordered a Medium, which is what I'd normally order. It fits true to size. Great for base layers, as it's thin material but warm and insulating. The outer material is nice, as it should wick away moisture. The inner lining is a super soft fleece. The sleeves were long enough for me, which is amazing since most sleeves on me run short. The top had room to spare. The pants fit snug (but stretchy) as they're supposed to in order to not let cold air get thru. These are great for cold weather. They came very nice packaged in the company's informative sealed bag. I love these.
",0.88413667785,fashion," I purchased men's product first and I really like the quality in my husband told me that it was comfortable so I decide to purchase for one for myself. For womans is super light and high quality as well as warmth is great. I do have fur-lined leggings but those could get really tight and I find it uncomfortable to wear to go to sleep. this is warm but still breathable. Also is great quality because I've purchased cheap stuff and sewing will break right away. However as you can see in my video even though I stretch the stitches are just fine without any popping or breaking. And it comes back to how it was so it has a great recovery. Highly recommended if you live in somewhere that's super cold.
",0.20617452385,fashion," I don't know what the heck kind of fabric this is, but it is super thin... yet extremely warm.  I'm one of those ladies that is ALWAYS cold!  This made me down right sweat!  Love how it gives you a seamless feel, so it will be great for any outdoor activity in the winter, but I could totally see myself using these as pajamas,  They are THAT warm!  I am currently a size 12 and purchased a Large.  Fits pretty snug as you can see
",0.89807009785,fashion,"These are AMAZING !!  I first got them for my granddaughter, then for my husband... finally .... for myself .... I already knew how much they loved them .. they are ULTRA SOFT/ULTRA SMOOTH.... like silk on the outside, fleece on the inside.98% microfiber, 8% spandex, they have 4 way stretch, they move with you, they’re light, breathable, moisture wicking, extremely comfortable.I wish I would’ve gotten them earlier.... but I have them now !!!!!Machine wash, cool or line dry.Do yourself a favor and get some of these this winter.... you can even sleep in them..I’m telling you ladies, these are GREAT !!!And at this price... you can get several packs !!!!
",0.97091925185,fashion,"Its very cold in NY and my wife ordered these and she really lime these under warmers. She wears it for college and she really like these. I checked it out too the material is very soft and good quality and keeps you warm. If you live in cold weather you must buy it. Must check the size chart before order
",0.585,fashion,"I wear size M/L. Got the large and it is just fit to be under cloths. Tight enough for me!I got the men set first for my dad and he liked it a lot so I got him another set and got this set for me (since I have low thyroid that makes me feel cold all the time).Very happy with my purchase.Pros:-Light weight-Color just like image-Good size chart-Good quality material.-Soft warm layer from the inside to keep you warm. (Check my photos!)-Good fit/length that won’t too long that be shown from below the sweater or pant but again not shot that you feel the cold!-Good deal for pack of two sets.Cones:Nothing in mind yet but will update if something pop upRecommend!
",0.73239767685,fashion," After purchasing a set of the children's thermals for my nephew, I decided to get a set for my sister as well.  Yes, he is still at the age where matching his mother would be fun.  However, I really didn't buy them to ensure they matched.  I got them because these thermals are ridiculously soft and comfortable.Pros include warm PJs/Underwear that are also super comfy and fit really well.  Considering you get two sets (top & bottom), the price is also excellent as well, imo.  Cons, if any, would be that they only come in black & grey (at least for now).  It will be awesome if they release them in other colors (hint hint!).
",0.95935034886,fashion,"Can’t wait until the weather is cool enough to wear this  It’s so adorable  The buffalo check is very trendy  this is well made and has a soft furry lining too  It is definitely more of a black gray check  Not black and white like the photo looks  Great buy  You will not be disappointed in this purchase
",0.94084888786,fashion,"I must say that this jacket is quite comfy to touch and wear; it has a sort of fluffy texture. I like the plaid design as well. The zipper works well. The seller did a great job in packing the product in a nice vaccum sealed bag for shipping. I ordered a small size and it is a perfect fit - not too loose and not too fitted either. I am 5' and 145 lbs and usually wear a medium. The sleeves are just a tiny bit longer than I like, but that's because I am petite size. So, I have nothing but good things to say so far! It keeps me very comfortable in 40F windy weather.

",0.84329855486,fashion,"This pullover is amazing!! It came to my doorstep vacuum sealed via prime. The jacket takes a day to fluff out, but it is so thick and fluffy! The inside in lined as well so it’s extra warm! I’m 5’7 120lbs and I purchased a small and it definitely has the perfect oversized fit without being too big or boxy. I also loved the price for a Sherpa-dupe!!Follow @winestainedstyle for more amazon reviews!
",0.91221582986,fashion,"I’m usually leery of buying clothes online because you can’t try them on beforehand. I’m so glad I bought this. It fits perfectly. It’s true to size, which ca. Also be hard to find online. It’s really soft and very warm, probably warmer than a sweatshirt. I’m considering buying the other color since I like this one so much!
",0.88378393786,fashion,"The absolute best Amazon find I have bought this season. This sherpa pullover is incredible!!! It’s sooooo soft and warm - perfect for the cold Chicago weather. So many Instagram influencers have promoted similar items which I have bought only to be disappointed by the quality of the item. I’m 1000% honest when I tell you this is a staple piece actually worth it. The material is great, soft on the inside and outside. What I love too is the inside soft material lining is different than the outer soft sherpa material. Again, the quality is here people. The zipper actually works and the sewing/stitching is on point with the zipper aligning straight down and not in the middle of the plaid. I am 5’8 (long arms) 130lbs and bought a M in both the grey plaid AND the red orange one. Which is a beautiful color! Also I washed them inside out on hand wash/delicate and laid out to dry.

",0.1548449486,fashion,"This is the cozies and cutest 1/4 zip pullover! I will be living in it until further notice!! It is so soft and warm! I love the buffalo check too! This is perfect with jeans or leggings!! It will basically be a staple all winter!! It fits true to size but it has a relaxed fit, which is perfect. My other favorite is that it has pockets!!! Most ones I’ve looked into do not have pockets, which I feel are a necessity! I’ll be picking up another color for sure!
",0.97267919886,fashion,"This sweater is amazing! It fits exactly as I expected and it is extremely warm and comfortable. I pictured the inside might be a little itchy and that I would have to wear this over a long sleeve shirt, but that was not the case. I wore it with a t shirt and it was really soft. I highly recommend this sweater- it is cute, comfortable, warm, and a perfect item for your fall wardrobe.
",0.86657279787,fashion," Love it! I’m in-between a small and medium and got the medium and love how it fit. It’s super soft too.It’s warm but not too warm. If I was wearing in a windy day without a coat I’d want a long sleeve shirt under it and then it would be really warm!But for a party where you want to wear a sweater but don’t want to be roasting hot it’s perfect! It definitely has some warmth, don’t get me wrong, but the holes in the knit design allow a nice little breeze to go through.
",0.12400323287,fashion," Love the waffle knit and oversized fit!
",0.87700229987,fashion,"Ordered a size up for a looser fit! Thicker and warmer than expected but perfect for Ohio weather this time of year! Cute with leggings or jean shorts
",0.87167853187,fashion,"Super comfy, lightweight waffle knit! Good quality, great detailing. Fits a little oversized. Would size down one if you want a more fitted look. I got my true size medium. Great everyday Fall piece.
",0.954617587,fashion,"This oversized sweater is perfect for layering over leggings. It’s an acrylic/spandex blend so it has a little bit of stretch. I do not find it itchy at all! I am usually a small, but ordered the medium for a larger for.
",0.15164738987,fashion,"The material is super soft. I needed an oversized sweater to wear around the house with leggings when I didn’t want to get dressed but need to be out of pajamas.... the sweater is perfect for that. It has a very loose, baggy fit similar to a sweatshirt with a more presentable look. If I were to wear it out I would size down for sure, and opt for a long layer underneath. The washing instructions are generous- I chose to hand wash and lay flat to dry so the sweater wouldn’t snag or become any more unfitted
",0.16841334187,fashion,"So soft and comfy!! It’s become my favorite sweater and I will probably order more colors. I would caution that  it is not a tight/closed knit waffle, you can see through it some and it could snag because of the weave.  If you have a bra a different color than the sweater it’s going to show, I just make sure to wear a tank top under mine.
",0.91211658787,fashion,"First time I have ever received clothes on a vacuum package... Color is beautiful, size is a bit larger than expected but nothing too serious. Then again, I went for a size up since I wasn't sure it would fit. Good for autumn weather, doubtful it'll be warm enough for winter. Still, lovely and a keeper.
",0.80820989687,fashion,"The pics show the sweater big enough to wear with leggings in the 'slouch' style. I assumed that was the basic fit. So I ordered a medium. It fits exactly like a regular medium no slouch to it. I would have ordered a larger size had I known that. As it is it fits and I can wear it the only problem are the sleeves. I'm only five one and a half so I do not have long arms or legs. The sleeves barely fit my wrists.  I have to keep pulling them down. But I do love the wine/burgundy color.
",0.10488137687,fashion,"This sweater is a great value It does hang a little weird and the bottom band has to be folded up so that it ""drapes"" (at least over wide hips) or else it bulges weirdly around the hips. The only reason I took away a star is I had to keep adjusting it throughout the day to make sure it was hanging nicely, but it wasn't horrible and it looked super cute. It's also really soft. I wish it was just a little baggier. I normally wear large but sized up to XL, probably would get another in 2XL to get a slouchy fit.
",0.1032932788,fashion," Llllooooovvveeeeee!!!!! 100% recommend!!!!I am absolutely obsessed with these leggings. I have bought a lot of leggings. These are my favorite. They're super stretchy with an appropriate amount of compression. As a result, they don’t feel tight at all. The waist is high and it shows my body shape perfectly. The way it looks on me is perfect.I bought lulu lemon before, but it is too expensive. This year, I started to look for the best yoga leggings whose price is under $20. These yoga pants came to my view and began to be my favorite after I compared a lot of similar products.  Simple words are not able to express how soft and fit they are, you will understand after you put on them.  These leggings will not generate camel toe because the leggings have a special CROTCH GUSSET. Also, the crotch of the leggings is not easily ripped because of the CROTCH GUSSET.  I have to mention the HIDDEN POCKET on the inside of the waistband is really great. Literally, it does the best at hiding bloating after I tried so many different brands of leggings. At the same time, the buttery soft fabric is much more compressive and smooth than other material.The material ventilates and does not expose thong lines (no one likes that kind of girl walks around with defined underwear lines!). There is no doubt these leggings are the best at the same price. I love these leggings so much. They fit perfectly. Trust me, you will definitely fall in love with these leggings.I would highly recommend these pants! You will not regret for buying them!!!
",0.97040402988,fashion,"I am in between a medium and large, so I went with large. They fit good and comfortable, but I could have easily done a medium. I really like the side pocket, my phone with case fits in there. It is convenient when I am holding the kids or just need somewhere to put my phone. I have compression leggings also from another company, and comparing the two, these are more stretchy and breathable, I wouldn’t say they are the compression material (that squeezes everything!) I can bend, move, and I feel comfortable in them.
",0.93742287288,fashion,"Can't say enough great things about these leggings. They fit well and as expected and I love the high waist. I also love the pockets on the side! The reflective accents on the bottom are great for walking/being out at night. The color was as pictured and great for casual wear or exercise. Can't wait to get some others in different colors.
",0.96581292288,fashion,"I""m 5'4"" and 145lbs and they are great.  I admittedly have a larger butt and I always size to large for yoga pants (leggings and otherwise).  I wear 29 waist jeans as reference as well on sizing.these fit great, good form fitting in the midsection with structure and comfort at the same time.  they are plenty thick and love the pocket!  The decoration on the leg is the only indicator you're not wearing a pointe pant without standard pokcets!  I will wear these to work out, run errands and even with boots to go out!
",0.86266064688,fashion,"Upon getting these I wore them about instantly. I love the material...its soft, super comfortable, its not to thin that Im worried people can see to much when Im working out, but they also are breathable yet not to thick I feel like im dying of heat when working out. Oh and I love the pockets in them, since most workout pants dont have them like these ones. I got the pinkish color which I liked it since I wear a lot of black tops and didnt want black on black, but My husband on the other hand didnt care for the color (he also was not asked his opinion; he said it looked to close to a skin tone... its pink and last I checked I dont know anyone with pink skin). Also, key thing I love about these... they are super cute and comfortable regardless if I ever go to the gym again or not they will be worn plenty
",0.86797440188,fashion,"Bought size M in Black and Navy, I'm 5', 165 lbs, about 35"" waist and 41 hips. This pants fit perfect for my height and size. I love the material, looks and feels expensive. I have purchased many brands including Nike, Reebok, FLEO and Lululemon and this material and quality can very well compare to those brands. I have also ordered several other pants from Amazon and I have always sent them back because of the material or length.The pants do have a small band on the waist which originally I was put off by it, but it doesn't affect the look and fit of the pants. I haven't exercised in them yet so not sure how they will perform, but so far I love them. They look squat proof. Plan to use for weightlifting and CrossFit.Update: exercised in them at they perform great. I did have a little of a roll down with the waist band but that usually happens to me with any pants. Other than that it was good for squatting, no sweat marks and kept form.

",0.25583553388,fashion,"These leggings fit just like Victoria's secret workout pants except softer.  They are extremely comfortable to wear and thicker than expected. I love the pockets that they have.  My only complaint would be instead of a large elastic on the top it has a large band and a small elastic about 2 fingers wide. It doesnt seem to create the lumpy look though.Edit: so after wearing the leggings a couple times and washing them once, the seam ripped on the butt part. I reached out to the company and they sent me a new pair. The customer service is fantastic
",0.19862595288,fashion,"The sizing was accurate according to the chart provided.  These run small in general but follow the chart and you’ll do fine.  I wear a 10 or 12 in lululemon and a large in athleta.  These pants are great they have large pockets idea for keys and phones when chasing small children.  These didn’t fall down at all and the fabric doesn’t seem prone to pills or pulls in them.  They are similar to lululemon fabric closest to any I’ve bought on amazon.  I’d say try them and see if what you think !

",0.99227249690,fashion,"I love how this sweatshirt fit. Im 5ft 120lbs and ordered the small. It has that loose fit me on me. Love that is its still long enough to do the front tuck look or leave it as is. I love the blush color and its perfect for this fall weather!
",0.81585490790,fashion," Sweatshirt is super cute, the blush color was just as pictured. I got a size XXL (I am usually a M/L, but usually need to size way up when buying clothes online). The sweater was really big but comfy, so I could've probably just gone with a large. I haven't washed it yet, but I don't think that it will shrink in the wash.
",0.81277257290,fashion,"I love this shirt! Material is nice and keeps me warm but breathable at the same time. I am 5 foot 8, 140 lb and the medium seems to fit very well on me
",0.82258874290,fashion,"The quality is fine on this top, but in the picture it appears to have a dolman sleeve which is does not. It fits just like a sweatshirt with a little thinner fabric. The model is probably wearing a full size or even more larger than normal. It's a decent buy if you want a basic sweatshirt.
",0.80131977890,fashion,"This is a cute pullover! I wouldn’t exactly call it a sweatshirt or a long sleeved shirt... it’s somewhere between the two. It is really comfortable. I like the color and the material. The collar lays on my shoulders a little weird, but it’s not a big deal. I’m excited to wear this as the weather gets cooler! I definitely see this pullover as something I’ll wear over and over again! I would recommend this product.
",0.93923723790,fashion,"This sweatshirt is super cute! I got the olive color and I am loving it! Such a rich and unique color for fall. This sweater sweatshirt is so cute. I am super excited about it. I got the olive color and it is really pretty. I got my usual size medium and it fits a bit oversized, but does not look sloppy.

",0.95928120692,fashion,"Daughter loved them!!
",0.97576105693,fashion,"This is really thin. Not sweatshirt like at all. It’s more of a silky pajama top than a sweatshirt tunic. It was not as large as on the model, not as long or loose. I’m a medium in most shirts or size 10, and got a medium. I’m also 5’3” so I don’t know why it wasn’t as long on me. I feel the model pulling on the pockets makes it appear to fit differently, and I bet she’s wearing two sizes too big. It was comfortable but boxy. Did nothing for my figure. I could have exchanged for a size larger but the fabric was so poor I did not want to keep it anyway. If it was sold with matching pants would be perfect loungewear/pjs. I spent double on a knit tunic at Macy’s and am much happier in it.
",0.08340573393,fashion,"Love it! It’s so soft and fit well. Great Quality!
",0.98627471993,fashion,"It's a bit thinner material than expected, but it's soft and stretchy which is nice.  The sleeves are a bit narrow for the shirt size and the cuffs at the bottom fit snug and have very little give to them.  I probably won't risk drying it after washing because if it draws up even a little, it will be uncomfortable as the overall size is small which I anticipated so I ordered a larger than normal size.
",0.19374063693,fashion,"I bought the blue one. Love the color, love the softness of the fabric, love the length. I was hoping it would be “flowy” sort of oversized like in the photo. It wasn’t. I bought the XXLG. I normally buy a plus sized 2X. It did fit  like a normal sweater would, so I am keeping it. I was just a little disappointed that it wasn’t more “tunic-like”. Maybe XXLG isn’t the same as Plus sized. It’s a nice sweater, regardless.
",0.8817963693,fashion,"If your looking for a loose fit as shown in the photos, then I recommend sizing up, otherwise its true to size.
",0.86495286293,fashion,"I ordered in 2 sizes because I was worried about it being too fitted and wanted the bigger loose look. I ended up keeping the smaller one and it was still REALLY big.  The sleeves are long too.  But, it definitely has that cute slouchy oversized look and I got a ton of compliments when I wore it.  The material is soft, not heavy but not really thin either.  Kind of like a lighter weight sweatshirt or sweater, but heavier than a T.  I really love it.  I got the purple color and it was very much like the photo.
",0.22353601593,fashion,"I love this sweater/shirt. it's kind of thin/lightweight, but it's also a really warm material. I can never stay the same temp so this little number is perfect. I wear it for anything, relaxing to going out(so cute with a long necklace). The pockets are a cute touch and it really doesn't even sag that much when I put my phone in the pocket, I didn't think I would actually use the pockets for anything but they are a decent size(small but not tiny). It is a loose fitting, butt covering, long sleeve, tunic. I love the color and style.
",0.9641336293,fashion,"What I liked about this product is that it is lightweight.  I run a hot internal temperature. In other words, I’m usually always hot! I live now in WI, so like everyone, I’m freezing when outside during winter (which lasts 6 miserably cold months), but as soon as I get indoors, I’m hot! So this type of sweatshirt is perfect for me. It’s very pretty and feminine. It’s a loose tunic style that you can dress either up or down. The reason for the 4 stars is that I’m not sure how durable this sweatshirt will be after being washed and dried. It’s 65% poly/ 35% cotton, which is usually durable, but the very soft fabric may pill or threads may pull loose. The kind of icons they use (it’s made in China) Seem to indicate that it shouldn’t be bleached. I don’t really understand the rest of the icons. So I’ll wash it with regular shirts and hope for the best!After a couple washings (If I remember) I will add an update.
",0.8663115593,fashion,"This is my 2 x purchasing this shirt however different seller’s so be mindful of sizing my fist one I bought the khaki it surprisingly fit perfect 👌 ok awesome it’s drawn up a little too after washing still love ... this grey trimmed in dark grey is so soft n comfy dang if it were a dress I’d wear too! With leggings it s adorable this time I sized up so I could wear it with leggings n boots 🥾 Ohhh laa laa! I got it on a lighting deal both times buy it u won’t regret it size up for baggy fit if you want it to be fitted still cute true to size !

",0.594,fashion,"I live in snowy Buffalo and needed a new pair of boots for this winter. The price was right and the style looked similar to other stylish boots. Seriously, these boots look cool. As a former runner, the first thing I noticed about these boots was the thick rubber bottom which will be nice in avoiding getting my feet wet. I immediately noticed how light the boots were while in the Amazon bag. I can't wait to walk through the snow with these, they are slightly heavier than sneakers. I saw in the initial picture that there were fur on the outer edge near the ankle but didn't reallize it covered the entire inside of the boot. As a result, my feet are pleasantly warm while I am wearing them in my cold basement.I chose the blue color and I am happy I did
",0.82837700894,fashion,"Exact size. Good on feet and good quality. I feel heat and warm from this snow shoe. Still early for the snow , however i already prepped for the winter as its imminent lol.

They are really warm still it was only about 60 degrees outSize, I'm 9.5 and they do feel a little bit loose but I don't mind because the shoe goes right above the ankle. I would wear socks too so it will fit perfectly.
",0.80682945394,fashion,"My old shoes were getting busted and it's beginning to get really cold here in Georgia. These shoes are a huge upgrade to my former pair and fit super well. The fluffy inside actually makes it easier to put on and keeps everything real comfy. I use these for riding my motorcycle as well and they work for that too surprisingly, enough top padding to make it easy to shift is a blessing to my foot.
",0.92484605394,fashion,"Got them right on time since winters started early at my place. These have a warm cushion inside, and as such feels very soft and comfortable. It runs slightly large, I guess due to extra space due to soft material inside, however with the lace tied up, it feels fine. Temperature went to around 2 degree Cel. Haven't got a chance to check for further lower temperature yet. These shoes are sturdy and seems strong. If a person needs very light shoes, then these may not be the right shoes for them, but if you looking for strong, heavy and sturdy ones, then these should be good.
",0.24315708994,fashion,"I think these boots are pretty nice looking. The furry lining make these boots soft and warm. They are pretty lightweight and comfortable. These boots are a little too warm for the weather right now. It is November, but the temperature is in the 80s to 90s. It does have a furry removable insole, and I need to try removing them to see if it makes the shoes a little cooler. These boots will be good for when the weather gets colder or for going to the snow. The rubber soles provide a good non-slip traction to the sidewalk, streets, roads, rocks, or whatever is in your path. I ran water over the shoes for a while, and while the outside material got damp, the water didn’t make it to the inside of the shoe. These should be good to use on rainy days to keep your feet warm and dry
",0.594,fashion,"Very comfy and warm and look very cool. They arrived right on time, the temp dropped and I didnt have anything warm to wear, I normally dont buy shoes from internet but decided to take a risk and it paid off, great product that actually fits as expected and looks just as good as on the pictures, and actually comfortable. Great product

",0.80326783796,fashion,"I usually but the Costco Kirkland ten pack of crew socks but decided to give these a shot as I go through a lot of white crew socks for workouts, hiking and to go underneath my orthotic boot that supports my burst achilles. I like, but do not love these socks as reflected in the rating. They are plenty competent and have an attractive price, but they have a bit too much synthetic content for me.I have somewhat sweaty feet. I know, TMI. I really value the comfort of nearly 100% cotton against my skin. These are more like 80% and the balance various synthetics. This means that they do a super job of stretching and conforming, but not such a super job with sweaty feet. Not a catastrophe, but not the best for me compared to the Kirklands. Another issues is that these are not as cushioned on the sole as the Kirkland. Still cushioned and still comfortable, but not as cushioned or as comfortable.I will use these and be happy with them. I may even get some more if needed in the future. If the price were the same, I'd go 100% cotton.
",0.823758996,fashion,"These socks are very well made, pretty stretchy and cushy.  They remind me more of the highly rated Galiva brand of socks in their fabric, and less like the top rated Nike socks.  I wear both of those.  They seem to be holding up pretty well in the wash as well.They are great for casual wear but I would not use them for running or hiking, which I do a fair amount of.  Really, they are not athletic socks, they are ""athleisure"".If I can give you a tip, my advice would be to buy several packages and throw out or donate all your other socks.  This way you never have to match them up again.  And you can toss all your socks in a cloth basket or small hamper and just grab two whenever you need them.  Then I never have to worry about losing a sock again, because I'll never know I lost one.  If the basket starts looking empty, I just buy another package :)Just a tip.  and these socks are good enough to do that.

I am going to order a few more colors as a staple to my fall wardrobe.
",0.202643812100,fashion,"I purchased these in grey. The first thing I noticed was there's color on the white sole on both sneaker wedges and on both sides. It appears that it bled through since it's not incredibly dark. The other thing is that I usually wear an 8 1/2 or a 9. I purchased these in an 8 1/2 and they are a little big.

Yes, but what about the taste you may ask?

",0.8315726521,grocery,"I have to admit that this is pretty much an impulse buy.  I love hot sauce in general on things like pizza, pasta, and Mexican foods.  I love fresh truffles and have been lucky enough to have them on several occasions.  So I was certainly intrigued for a truffle hot sauce.  I thought what the heck, and went all in on what appeared to be the best product with this special white truffle sauce.  Also, it appeared to get amazing reviews!I think this sauce is a little of a mixed bag for me.  It definitely has a strong ""pungent"" truffle flavor and smell. Is it amazing like fresh truffles? Well no, but perhaps that isn't really a fair expectation.  I think it has a little more of that truffle oil type flavor.After you get that smell of truffle, the poor shows a rich thick sauce that certainly looks vibrant and pleasing.I actually really like the chili blend they have chosen.  It tastes rich, with a nice depth of flavor and about the right amount of heat. I would say about a 6 on the heat scale.  You definitely get it, but you can pour a good amount on what you will eat.  So the truffle does seem to add to the earthy flavor layered on the hot chili and thick sauce.And, this is where it gets a little weird for me.  There is a huge hit of sweetness in the finish.  Now, I saw some reviews about this with their other black truffle sauce.  People even argue that sweet and heat is a natural pair.  I think this is totally true, you can have sweet with hot in bbq, wings etc.  And actually one of my favorite sauces yellow bird does an amazing job using carrots and orange to cut heat.  In Truff they use agave nectar, and I just think it is way to sweet!  It is a huge miss for me in an otherwise good sauce.  Imagine taking Tabasco and mixing it with corn syrup.  The sweetness just kills it.I should have listened to those that said this in the other sauce review.  So make sure you want SWEET in your hot sauce.  This is a 10 on the Sweet scale.My advise to Truff is to ditch the agave.
",0.9849604371,grocery,"Really disappointed . Not because it dosnt taste good but it taste the same as the normal truff. I’ve been a fan since it started and thought paying the ridiculous price for this would be like angels kissing my lips. Instead I feel cheated . We all sat around and tasted both and they have literally put the normal truff sauce in a calogne box and charged you way too much. Who needs a fancy box for hot sauce . Get a grip. They are taking the piss and I feel cheated and robbed . I expected more cos. Supported them from the start but please don’t wast ya money . I’m f ya wanna buy from them just buy the regular one cos no effort has been made other than a fancy box to steal ya money

Is it enough to justify the doubled price tag? Nah. The packaging is fancy so I guess that’s a plus for gift giving. I will stick with the original Truff, though. I read reviews saying this product wasn’t worth the price tag but then saw some video reviews on social media. I’d be curious to see a blind taste test between the three Truff flavors to see how many can truly differentiate between them all.

Tea is soothing, especially in Winter, so this is totally appropriate, and a thoughtful gift for any tea lover.This Advent Calendar with 24 Different Teas is nicely packaged, and very colorful.  They even included a small piece of jute cord, to hang the Advent Calendar.  Even the tea packets are colorful.  The tea packets look like ornaments, and each tea is numbered, from 1 to 24, but for some reason the numbers are not consecutive, in order, like 1, 2, 3, etc, so that you need to hunt for the number you need, as the days go on.I have no idea if all Advent Calendars are this way, but my personal preference would be to have the teas in consecutive order, from 1 to 24.Each tea is different, unique, not your run of the mill teas.  An added bonus, all of the teas are organic.  There are spicy teas, fruit teas, green teas, etc.  An interesting variety, to say the least!  I don't want to get more specific than that.  I want to leave a little element of surprise!A very festive gift, with nice attention to detail.
",0.80611908413,grocery,"The concept of tea instead of chocolate for an advent calendar sounded appealing to me.  It's a festive looking calendar when you open or hang it.

I'll put a little mark there by each one I like in case I want to order them again and an X by ones that I didn't care for so I know not to.I like the wide variety of teas you get with it.  Licorice is in a few of them though so that scent kind of overwhelms the rest when you open it up.

The tea quality is great and you will have a flavorful cup every time. I wanted to review this before December so people can buy it even though I wanted to use it as an advent calendar myself! Again, so cute and great herbal teas. They’re all very different from each other which is cool!

",0.97932553313,grocery,"The packaging of this Advent calendar is vibrant and attractive! The types of teas included in this Advent calendar are tasty and a wide variety. My only disappointment is I don't like licorice and there are a few that include licorice. Nevertheless, having this many teas to try and discover new ones to love is a wonderful adventure! The teas have a robust flavor. Great experience!
",0.90518367313,grocery,"This is a great gift idea! It comes with 24 different teas to countdown to Christmas. There are some interesting flavors, like peppermint and licorice, lemongrass and ginger, as well as some traditional ones, like chamomile, mint, and apple cinnamon. Some of the teas are caffeine free and some are not. All of the teas say they are ethically sourced and organic.
",0.93279802814,grocery,"I made a pot of this, and just after drinking one cup from that pot, I became Canadian, eh.  It gave me the confidence to finally try ice skating, and before I knew it, I was stopping on a dime and blasting snow chips at tiny children.  If you can't take the ice, get out of the rink.  Also, I was a lot nicer to people.  Pretty sure this is a drug that all Canadians are taking which makes them pleasant and good at ice sports.  My optimum pot is 10 cups of water and 7 scoops of this magic stuff.
",0.93815827414,grocery,"I've been enjoying Tim Horton's coffee every day for well over a decade. I used to bring it back from Canada, however, was excited to see Amazon start carrying it! The problem with the coffee isn't the seller, it's how the quality and flavor has suffered recently. A once loved, well-balanced, smooth, and approachable roast has become more harsh, bitter, and honestly off-putting. I imagine new corporate interest is responsible for the change, which is unfortunate. But if it's not broken, why ""fix"" it? Definitely not the Timmy's I knew and loved. So disappointing.Update: 11/23/18 I've found that Seattle's Best House Blend (medium roast) is a perfect match that's consistently reminiscent of the once-tasty Tim Horton's.
",0.23624163914,grocery,"I think you love the coffee you grow up with, so I struggle to be objective.  I grew up in Buffalo, NY for 22 years, and this is from a Canadian coffee shop chain, whose (deceased) owner (Tim Horton) used to play for the Buffalo Sabres at one point.To make a long story short, I moved to Boston and missed this coffee terribly.  Though I can't say I was homesick, as I loved my new job and surroundings.  But essentially, I got this coffee now both in my house and in my office, where my coworkers make fun of me for my Canadian coffee, while they drink Dunks (the official drink of Boston, next to Guiness).I make it in a french press at home and its truly fantastic.. I concentrate it a little more than they do at the coffee shops themselves and its perfect.  Smooth, flavorful, not acidic/bitter, and nicely caffeinated.Love you Timmy's.  Wish you didn't sell out to Burger King though.
",0.09781181814,grocery,"I drank this for 2 weeks trying to like it. It has such great reviews that I was excited to try it. I just couldnt. I grew up on good ole Folgers with the rich roast flavor which this does not have.  I played with the amount of grinds I used but it just doesnt have the flavor I was looking for.  I can tell it is a quality product but probably not right for those who like a stronger roast flavor.
",0.92543959614,grocery,"We subscribe to this coffee.  I first had Timmie's coffee in Afghanistan at a little outpost shop they set up on our post.  It was a welcomed treat in that environment...much like a glass of water would be in the middle of the Sahara.  Of course, during that time, taste expectations go down and you adapt to what's available but we thought it was GREAT coffee.  When I saw it on Amazon, we first purchased the smaller bag, for nostalgia's sake.  The first pot brewed was tasty...smooth, no bitter aftertaste.  My husband and I much prefer it to other brands you can purchase in the stores.  However, while I rave about this coffee, I have to say it's our ""every day"" coffee.  This isn't going to win any awards but it's much tastier and much preferred than say, DD or Folger's.  We will continue to purchase this, as we have for the last year!
",0.93811023214,grocery,"Great Coffee. I’ve moved a few years back from upstate NY to Charlotte, NC. I find myself constintley craving good coffee in the south. After trying a bunch of different types of coffee I realized a lot of different coffees make my stomach upset. So I stopped drinking coffee for 5 years. All of a sudden on Slickdeals.net I saw a Tim Hortons deal on Amazon. I was shocked they carried it on Amazon but then again it is Amazon. So I ordered a container. Just as smooth as I can remember and no upset stomach afterwords. If you want the perfect 10 cups use 1/2 cup of coffee grounds.
",0.85883182314,grocery,"Many years ago while traveling in Canada, and also in the New England area of the US, I was introduced to Timmy's.  I was hooked.  Their coffee, their baked goods, their service, their friendliness, the cleanliness of their restaurants (when not using the drive-thru), all excellent, without fail, at every location I happened upon.  During some of those road trips I was on, Timmy's coffee became my staple.  Fresh, hot, when I would get it to go it would fill the car with a delicious aroma.  The taste, even better.  Clean, crisp, no bitterness.  Very much a medium roast, but far better (to my tastes) than Starbucks (Pike's blend for instance) and better than Dunkin' Donuts.  I find Timmy's to be slightly stronger than Dunkin Donuts' coffee, but perhaps that's open to debate.  The point is that I like the taste of Timmy's far more than Dunkin's.At any rate, after leaving Canada/New England, I would often long for a cup of Timmy's.  Ordering it up - the next best thing.  Now anytime I feel like it, I can brew a pot of my own.  It's not quite the same, but it's very close. It also (marginally) makes up for not being able to pop into a Timmy's in person.I will state that ordering it through Amazon proved to be a fiasco.  To clarify, I did order direct from Amazon; but it was sold by Tim Horton's and fulfilled/shipped by Amazon.  Perhaps it was the shipping department staff member's first day on the job, but they felt it appropriate to throw the canister in a box seven times too big, with no padding, no protection, nothing.  It wound up at my front door looking like it had been sat upon and then kicked all the way to Miami Beach (where I live).  I complained to Amazon about this, but nothing has resulted.  I also emailed Tim Horton's corporate office to inform them of the manner in which Amazon is shipping their product, so maybe that complaint will circulate back to someone who matters within Amazon.  In any case, Tim Horton's itself advised me that whenever I want to order coffee, order directly from them and they will ensure it shipped safely and securely to me and, should it arrive damaged in any way, they will remedy the situation immediately.  Apparently no such guarantee is in place when fulfilled by Amazon.  Nonetheless, it's good to have that peace of mind and get the product direct from the source.  In that respect, from this point forward I will order directly from Timmy's.
",0.93094348914,grocery,"Tastes great, relatively consistent grinds and highly recommended. I have had various friends come over and state how much they love my coffee. Well, they love this coffee. I am a daily dunkin donuts 'regular' medium roast coffee drinker and highly recommend Tim Horton's as an extremely viable and tasty alternative at home. The big tub is a great buy and one I will keep buying for many years.
",0.99445593414,grocery,"There are so many flavored coffees that are simply inferior beans, all dressed up.  Tim Hortons (no apostrophe-who knew? There is an interesting story there.) is a popular brand in Canada and the US in select states-much like Dunkin Donuts nationwide.  The arabica bean they use is not bitter, and the medium roast makes a nice, mellow cup of coffee. If you are a fan of Tanzanian peaberry, this might be a good brew for you.  You cannot order their coffee directly through their website, and their site directs you to Amazon.  The good news is, I was recently in Ohio, and the two pound can only cost one dollar (US) less than ordering through Amazon, delivered to my door free with Prime.  The cans seem to rotate quickly, so I don’t believe you’ll be stuck with old inventory.  I know this can be a concern when ordering consumables through a warehouse.  The package label changed from my previous one a month ago to my most recent order (with the red label and notation “new look, same great taste). Sure enough, the “use by” dates were February 2020 and March 2020. So the packaging did recently change, and the stock dates were consistent with my order.
",0.95396161114,grocery,"Absolutely my favorite coffee.  A smooth, perfect strength blend.  Doesn't have the bitter taste I dislike.  Got hooked on it going to Canada over the years.  Friends would bring a can or two back when they visit Canada.  Finally occurred to me to check Amazon for availability.  I have been buying 4 cans from Amazon every two months at around $12 per can and it lasts 2 weeks per can.  I bought it in mid-February at just under $12.  In April, I was going to reorder and the price more than doubled.  It's $26 and change as of today.  Love the blend, but $26 is too pricey for me.  I'll keep watching for it to return to a reasonable price.

During their young years they were in Britain and drank even more tea. Since I have worked for them almost 20 years we have always had tea time at 4pmI bought this tea because I liked Chai and I saw it was from IndiaAfter serving this to my bosses we are already one quarter way into this bag I purchased less then a week in. They purchased this tea for themselves at home.We all are in agreement. This tea is amazing. I make it in huge pots and drink hot and even let it cool down for cold tea to drink the next day.

",0.76371800916,grocery,"Flavorful chai blend, but perhaps not as strong as it could be.  Still, better than a lot out there that sell for much more than this, so it gets a solid 4 stars.First thing's first, they use a good tea base --good old basic CTC tea.  Masala chai needs CTC tea for flavor.  Full-leaf, tippy ""premium"" artisan blends just don't cut it if you want real chai.  Second, it's not picky about the water/tea/milk ratio.  Several mixtures work, but I've found that 1 heaping regular spoon (spoon you eat with, not measuring spoon), 8 oz. water and 8 oz. milk produces a nice, rich milky blend for two people.  Start from there and adjust to your taste.  Don't make this WITHOUT milk...you're just wasting it otherwise.  This is meant to be enjoyed the traditional way, made with milk, in a pot on the stove, strained into a cup and sweetened.The only problem is that the spice blend they use is just a bit on the subtle side.  It's definitely noticeable and imparts a good flavor.  I'm just used to something a bit richer.  The picture shows more spices than I personally got in my bag, and I mixed it up beforehand to make sure it didn't all settle on the bottom.  I'm glad that they don't overload on the cinnamon, which is something a lot of companies do and it overpowers everything else.  This is nice, balanced, subtle...I just wish it had a bit more punch, and I wish they included ginger.  That would make this a 5-star tea.  All in all though, it's a good value.

I've bought tea in India, and in the US at both standard and India grocery stores, in the search for a delicious chai tea.  There is simply no comparison to this one. We've brewed it both in the traditional way, or just as a cuppa black tea with a bit of milk. It's excellent, either way.In addition, the Vahdam Tea folks  are  terrific.  I asked  which type of a Darjeeling tea (see separate review)  would best suit what I wanted. Not only do these folks know their tea, they are helpful and pleasant as they share their knowledge.
",0.96519374816,grocery,"A taste of VAHDAM Chai isn't taking a sip (or a pot!) of tea. It's an experience. And an amazing one, bursting with flavor, texture and feeling. And the scent is reminiscent of Autumn. (My favorite season, btw.)  Despite the rich aroma and flavor, I still felt that it was missing a ""kick"" of some sort. Vahdam contacted me, kindly asking my opinion, and let me say, the customer service representative was amazing! We chatted back and forth about the best way to make a true chai latte. He seemed to think that what I was missing might possibly be more powerful spice. Well, not only was he kind, he sent two boxes of the Double Spice Chai, free of charge. Wow! As far as double the original, he was definitely right. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Seriously, for anyone who is in love with everything about the original chai, it's near perfect.☺😏 Pro's and Con's 😢It's missing two things-1) The Cardamom flavor is lacking (Cardamom is a necessity for my personal chai latte experience.). I can definitely taste (and see) extra cloves, black pepper, and tea - but much less cardamom.2) It is missing an ESSENTIAL ingredient: Ginger.*Vahdam makes Ginger Chai - but it must be purchased separately. Ginger is a staple.*Vahdam also sells Cardamom Chai - again, purchased separately. Excellent chai contains EXTRA Cardamom as well.  *Some people have the funds to buy all three: Double Spice, Cardamom, and Ginger - and then, MIX THEM TOGETHER. But my guess is that most people don't.  **It's far too expensive for me to make the entirely authentic recipe. excellent, quality spices are crazy expensive these days. But if you have the funds, mixing/making the completely authentic recipe is difficult to make, but the way to go. *(Add ginger, and extra cardamom too.)IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO THIS (No pun intended.)**Pro/Con:(If you AREN'T a snobbish tea enthusiast, like me, the authentic chai fannatic)VAHDAM is THE ONLY WAY TO GO!!

Best cup of tea I've EVER had. The only negative is that I don't think I can enjoy any of my other teas anymore. If this is what VAHDAM has to offer 💙💚💛 they have a new customer for life.
",0.9776238216,grocery,"I must be used to a stronger flavor of chai. This one was so subtle, it tasted like warm milk with a little seasoning (I make my chai with 1/2 milk, 1/2 water). Maybe I didn't add enough tea (2 grams in 1 cup) or didn't let it steep long enough (5 minutes). There just wasn't enough flavor here. I'll have to find another chai product, I suppose.Update: The seller reached out to me regarding their product, and I added two stars for how wonderfully they handled my disappointment in the flavor of the tea. They sent me their double spice masala chai, and while I haven't had a chance to try it yet, I'm sure it will be exactly what I'm looking for. If you are looking for a subtle chai flavor, choose this one, but if you want a stronger chai flavor, look for their double spice. I will definitely buy from this company again!

I decided to buy this tea with this hope of recreation. I've been boiling water, then adding a few extra teaspoons of loose tea, letting it steep longer to make stronger tea.

I have never seen any mold or other foreign objects in my bars, such as other reviewers posted, and they are always the perfect texture. These are the best when you want a sweet treat but are on a high protein (20g protein!) or restricted carb diet (such as Keto- our family counts net carbs, and these bars only have FOUR!). The chewiness, combined with the crunch of the cookies inside, makes these seem like a forbidden treat when dieting. I highly recommend you at least give these a try if you've seen the negative reviews. These are awesome, and so are the apple pie and oatmeal chocolate chip bars!I hope you found my review helpful.

I eat very healthy and don't need a gut clean out.
",0.20452931525,grocery,"I used to eat 1-2 quest bars per day. I did it for almost 2 years. I stopped for a few months because they were too expensive. Then I bought a box a couple of months ago. Around the same time I started experiencing horrible stomach cramps and bloating. It took me a while to make the connection between the quest bars and the stomach problems, because I had eaten them for so long without any issues. I actually thought maybe I was pregnant, or had an intestinal infection. Then I stopped eating hem for a week and I lost 4.5 lb pounds that I had gained in the past couple of months 5 days after I stopped eating the quest bars, and all the symptoms went away.

Sodium is lower which is the only positive here and Calcium is down by 5%I will now be cancelling my renewal.
",0.525,grocery,"Listen to the other reviewers!!! The formula changed, and it now has poor quality that causes a lot of digestion issues.  In addition, I too have experienced issues with the mold, and I have purchased the bars from many vendors other than Amazon, both online and in store.  In fact, one time I found a piece of metal in the bar.  When I contacted the company and sent pictures, they accused me off putting the metal in the bar, but ultimately blamed their vendors and dismissed it as an issue.One last note, if you are gluten free, they have changed many products to now be labeled with the combined facility/ equipment label.  I wonder how long before they all will have it.  If you're sensitive like I am, this is a big issues.For years, I used to use several quest products daily, but after all of that, I have eliminated their product from my world.  With that many issues and passive concern, it is a real safety issue!

I experience this issue periodically when trying other brands and chock it up to construction of the pod itself because my keurig can surely make a cup without getting grounds in the coffee as it has many times. Now I'm not talking about a whole ton of grounds in the cup like when a pod busts, but I would say probably 2/3 cups there are a few grounds floating around or a small amount of grounds left in the last sip of coffee.

Not a big deal as long as there is only one bad pod however it did get me thinking about the quality control.  If one bad pod got through the production and quality inspection I kind of wonder what else they are missing.  Just to be safe I probably will not buy this product again.  If I find another opened pod I will try to return what is left.  Otherwise the coffee tastes great.

If you're following a serious Keto regimen, know now these little squares contain 10 carbs each! That may be 1/2 of your daily carb intake. If these were 2 or 3 carbs, this would be a 5-star review. Also, Keto lifestyle is good for diabetics, as they too much watch their carbs. But these are just too high in carbs. Having said that, I do like the taste of these and I'll keep them in my car for a snack before stopping at a fast food place. But if you're following a strict Keto lifestyle, these are not for you.

I've never been diet snack eater so I was skeptical but it's not bad at all (pretty good with a cup of coffee ;-) but it's so small I had to eat a few to satisfy my need. If you are on Keto diet and following the plan and this might work for you.  Also, if you are watching sugar calories, this one has Erythritol which is a sugar alcohol used as a low-calorie sweetener. It provides only about 6% of the calories found in an equal amount of sugar.I don't care for artificial sugar taste so I won't be eating this.
",0.95858371336,grocery,"These are not terrible.  It is hard to make a true low carb bar that is good.  These are acceptable, but not by any means delicious.  They are firm, but not hard and not hard to swallow like some of these type bars.  I like the caramel and the nuts.  All in all, 4 stars.
",0.97486293336,grocery,"Taste: SLIGHTLY bitter, like dark chocolate... not overly sweet.Size: chocolate dipped oreo... smaller than I expected :/Healthy?: Depends on what you are looking for in your diet.Worth it?: Weigh the size with the health info/ingredients and decide for yourself. Personally, when counting calories, there's ""better bang for your buck"" for me.
",0.89026433236,grocery,"These are tasty treats that are prepackaged goodness for those on the Keto diet. These helped to curb my sweet craving. (I have a huge sweet tooth) I would recommend these for someone who has a hard time giving up sweets. They are a bit pricier on amazon than other places so I only gave them 4 stars

",0.96478438438,grocery,"Although the taste is excellent, the ingredients are very good, the quality control of wrapping each piece of hard candy and the quality control of placing the wrapped candy into the pouch for the consumer is less than adequate. I purchased the six-pack and, so far, two of the three bags I have opened have unwrapped pieces of the hard candy and many many extra pieces of the plastic wrappers used to wrap the candies. One bag had at least 1 extra wrapper for each wrapped candy. I realize the product is sold by weight, not by volume, but this seems a very unlikely way to give the customer less candy and substitute the candy weight with the weight of plastic wrappers. I will buy the product again because if the excellent taste; however, please be aware of the poor quality control.

Anyway, these have flavors I like that are not in the lollipop variety.  I only have two issues ... one is they are sooo small ... not at all like the advertised picture.  My other issue is it is hard to get the plastic wrappers off.. especially after you've had them for awhile.  Other than that they are really good and have more flavor than your regular hard candy.  However, since I hate fighting with the wrappers I'll probably go back to the lollipops ... or, try to find an alternative.  I haven't decided yet.
",0.04392367638,grocery,"These mints are powerful! They make my breath ultra fresh with one tiny mint. I like that they do not taste overly sweet like mint candies you can find in stores. I purchased since they are vegan; however, all of the other features (i.e. naturally flavored, no high fructose corn syrup, no soy, no egg, etc.). I assumed since there were 6 bags in the package, I anticipated that the mints would be weak in flavor and I would have to eat several to get the full effect, but that is not the case. These organic hard candies are small, individually wrapped peppermints. The flavor lingers for a very long time so one mint does the job. I love them and since the best before date extends into Jan. 30, 2019; I plan on purchasing more so I am not without them.

The only mistake I made with these is not quite realizing how many I bought...I bought a lot!  But that's ok...more to tuck away!

",0.81901121141,grocery,"I love the flavour of all of these bars, and they are great, overall BUT a word of warning, for those counting their calories: the fibre does not cancel out the carbs, period. These bars actually have between about 210 and 240 calories per bar, depending on the flavour. Yes, I know that the FDA counts fibre as 2 calories per gram, and allows manufacturers to count sugar alcohols as 0 calories per gram, but this isn't accurate, given that we don't actually know how many calories the gut can absorb (that said, it does vary from person to person). If you're counting calories, and especially if you're looking to lose weight, the safest way to go about eating these would be to track them very basically: calories = (fat grams)x9 + (carb grams)x4 + (protein grams)x4.

They are still good by themselves, but there is a slight aftertaste. I would not call this health food, as it is obviously a processed food with a long list of ingredients (as is nacho cheese Doritos.) But if you are trying to cut back on carbs and find yourself wrestling with cravings for your old friend Nacho Cheese Doritos, these will hit the spot!For comparison, according to the Frito- Lay website, a 1oz (28g) serving of Nacho Cheese flavored Doritos has:140 calories, 8g fat, 1 g sat fat, 0 trans fat, 210 sodium, 0 cholesterol, 16g carbs, 1g fiber, 0 sugar, 2g proteinAccording to the back of my Quest Nacho Cheese Tortilla Style Protein Chips, 1 bag (32g) has:140 cal, 6g fat, 1g sat fat, 0 trans fat, 10mg cholesterol, 340g sodium, 5g carbs,  1g fiber, sugars <1g, 18g protein
",0.548,grocery,"I’m newly on the Keto diet.  Today, I am 31 days clean from my addiction to Dr. Pepper!!! With the keto diet, I didn’t think I would succeed because I’m not necessarily a meal eater.  So, I searched for things that were tasty, quick, and filling, but also reasonably priced. So far, for the crunchy craving (because pork rinds get lame very quick), these actually fulfilled that crunch crave.  Of course they aren’t like regular chips, but after 15 days of strict dieting and checking ketones, this was a treat! I dip the ranch flavored ones in garlic hummus... hey, it works.... or I sprinkle shredded cheese on them and bake them in the oven and make like a ghetto nacho plate with some hot sauce.  Add a bottle of sparkling ice cherry limeade and it’s like you’re not even dieting! If I was not on a weight loss mission, of course I would choose the real ranch flavored corn chips, but these are a great substitute.  Hope this helps!
",0.95307791248,grocery,"So I was nervous to try these. I did like the Quest BBQ chips, I thought they were pretty decent but not enough to buy cases of them. I read the reviews on here and went out on a limb and bought a case. These are AMAZING! I can't believe they are 'healthier' and 'protein' chips. They really taste like an indulgence. I rarely eat chips only as a special treat so being able to eat these guiltlessly is awesome. They are super cheesy and give you cheesy finger residue like you're eating doritos or cheetos.... so nostalgia without feeling bad about it after! They are a little fragile so dipping them in something requires you to be gentle, but that doesn't really bother me as I pretty much just eat them plain anyway. I wish they were cheaper... but I love them anyway!
",0.75159716648,grocery,"Low Carb / Keto friends - I'm sure you all ended up here because you started off with Quest Protein Bars. I'm so glad they have expanded into making cookies and chips.CONSISTENCY - It doesn't give you the tortilla chip vibe, it's more like a tortilla chip with a cheez-it cracker type finish.FLAVOR - Nacho cheese flavor is in line with other chips. It does get a little salty for me by the end of the bag. I have tried Nacho Cheese and Ranch and think I prefer the Ranch flavoring more, but like both for the sake of variety.Either way, finding variety of snacks to do low carb / keto diets is tough, so this is great for snacking.

I was a little nervous to try these, but went out on a limb because I was desperate for keto snacks I could easily grab. I work night shift and sometimes get junk food cravings. These taste JUST like cool ranch Doritos. The chips themselves are a little thinner than Doritos, but I honestly like them even better! I can't believe these are so low carb. They are a little expensive for chips, but I don't eat a bag every day. Just a couple times a week to get through cravings. I love mixing these into taco bowls too!
",0.10294750348,grocery,"You cannot beat these!!! I have been on my version of low carb diet, and these work in great. Everyone in the family agrees that there is really no difference between these and lets say a bag of baked lays except the flavor is MUCH stronger on these (which is a plus). Nacho cheese is my favorite so far. I had the cheddar and sour cream and BBQ. These are almost the same as cheddar and sour cream but the sour cream part gives those a little bit of a funky after taste. If you like BBQ chips a lot you'll probably love those too, but I'm not a huge fan of BBQ chips. These nacho cheese ones are a great snack while I am working at my desk after a workout. It really feels like I am cheating until I remind myself it isn't by looking at the nutrition facts. They are expensive in comparison to other chips, but hey eating healthy typically is expensive. Having something you can enjoy is crucial to sticking to a diet. Also I am excited to try these as a coating on baked chicken!
",0.90856587948,grocery,"Of all the high-protein snacks that I've ever tried, these are the BEST! It amazes me that they have 19 grams of protein. I like them even better than ""real"" tortilla chips because they're thinner and crisper, and they are a perfect ""tide-me-over-til-supper"" afternoon snack with the protein that keeps your blood sugar level, preventing you from cramming high-sugar items into your body. They're a bit pricey, so I have to ration them, but they are helping me keep from gaining back the weight I lost last winter. So happy that Quest created these - am ordering a new box of them today.
",0.90713298348,grocery,"All I have to say is WOW. When I bought these I expected them to taste like awful diet stuff but I really miss Takis so I said screw it let's try it. HOLY COW. These taste just like the Lime Chilli Doritos and the Cheddar Cheese are even better. I love these so much im going to buy the ranch pack next. The consistency is a little airier and less crunchy than the traditional but it's a Low Carb food so what can you expect? Some of them do get a little crushed during shipping but I dont mind and these also make excellent ""breading"" for keto baked chicken nuggets.
",0.9157856748,grocery,"These are OK if you absolutely need a chip-like snack for Keto or low carb, but they just aren't that flavorful and taste artificial. If I'm very hungry (after a cardio workout) I will eat a bag no problem, but if I'm not, I never have an urge to eat these.It's a shame because other reviews made them sound mouthwatering - they just aren't to me. The quality of the chip itself is also just a little too brittle and for being so thin, you would think they could include more per bag. For that reason the value is not there either.

I love little surprises like that!The next one is the Brazilian Quince Honey. Now this one is a special one simply because of its velvety texture, its floral and almost orange blossom aroma, along with its delicate citrus flavor. This honey is light in color and has a thick consistency, surely a honey that you do not want to miss out on!The Brazilian Wildflower Honey has an amazing powerful aroma of the Brazilian country side during spring. The flavor has a slight hint of raisin, and orange peel. The over all texture of this honey is very smooth followed by a thin consistency. The finish of this is one that is ever so lasting, such a beautiful finish that I really close my eyes and enjoy the experience. Definitely a honey I would like to buy more of!And last but not least we have our lovely Brazilian Acacia. It opens up with an aroma that is rather fruity with some floral notes followed by an almost tropical blossom aroma, there is truly a balance of aroma's happening here and it is sure to take you for a sensory joy ride. Going on to the flavor of this honey, I get a kind of fruitiness from this, kind of like pineapple and mango married together but yet just absolutely so delicate followed by a silky smooth texture and thin consistency. As for the finish, it ends off with an amazing lingering taste that I wish would last hours longer.Honestly, I want to thank Bee Seasonal for sourcing such incredible high quality honey to share with us!Thank you!And thank you for reading this review!
",0.981899549,grocery,"I purchased this set before Christmas and wrapped each one individually to give as gifts for my coworkers.

The brands representatives were amazingly knowledgeable and kind, but their honeys were something else. Price is a bit high for me but the depth of flavors for these sought after honeys blew me away. Unfortunately I was clumsy and dropped one jar, shattering it, almost cried. I guess I’ll just have to repurchase!Would make an amazing present if you’re that kind of person. I couldn’t bare to part with them myself.
",0.23026683949,grocery,"I love honey but I am picky. I mostly purchase local honey (in addition to manuka) but went out on a limb for Christmas to treat myself to something new. Wow!  I am so glad I did, both my daughter and I enjoyed the initial tasting along with their descriptions. As well, I've used in my tea everyday, over fruit, yogurt, bagel, pancake, everything I can put it on that won't muddle the best taste ever!  My favorite is twisted lightly on a fork. You can't do better!  Thank you for such a superb product!!
",0.94742047849,grocery,"“I purchased this honey after hearing about this company from a friend. The honeys pair very well with cheeses. The idea of having four little jars of honeys instead of one is very nice. These are not the average honeys you can buy for cheap. They are special and therefore more expensive. But totally worthy!”
",0.84673297449,grocery,"The first time I had this was from someone that knew the sellers. We tested the 4 types of honey with 4 types of cheese and it was so fun to mix and match and taste. The honey is amazing! They each really do taste very different. It's really cool that they were able to source different flavor profiles and offer it all in the same package. After the initial tasting, I bought two more to give away as Christmas presents. It was definitely a more creative option gift than the usual and the families that received them loved them.

Dirty Sue Whisky Cherries are my absolute favorite so far!  They are large, taste amazing and crunch when you bite into them.  I also drip a bit of the cherry juice along with the cherries into my Jack Daniels Rocks.  I definitely recommend.

I have long since down selected my favorite combination of whisky and vermouth  but until now I had never been fully satisfied with any cherry. This is it. Everything else on the market is either too sweet and not flavorful enough, or they have flavor but not the right kind or the right amount. This has everything you could possibly want in one whisky cherry and these cherries are large. This is America's whisky cherry and I doubt very much that it can or will ever be outdone.
",0.83099383152,grocery,"Now, let me start with saying I LOVE Lakanto’s products, but this one was off mark. (It didn’t help matters that it arrived half crushed and half melted.)The almonds in it are nice and toasted, very crunchy, but the chocolate is insanely sweet in a strange way. Not like cheap milk chocolate (I’m a dark chocolate eater), just like way, way too much sweetener was added to it. Maybe because of this, it has a bit of a strange aftertaste.I was really excited for a new product to be on the market, but I’m going to stick with Lily’s as far as chocolate goes.
",0.83168947752,grocery,"I loved this! I read a lot of bad reviews AFTER I polished off the bag. I'm surprised by the bad reviews, because I thought they were delicious. Mine were individual pieces, not melted together so I assume that helped. There is a salty taste in the beginning, followed by a sweetness that I felt was perfect. I'd say try them for yourself, as opposed to going by the reviews. If you can't eat sugar, these are a life saver!
",0.79709827952,grocery,"Saw the other review and semi agree that its a little on the sweet size, but I'm ok with it.  Also, this is sweetened by monk fruit and it definitely has its own after taste.  If you are good with the monk fruit after taste (which I am) then this is a great snack.I think the sea salt and almonds balance it all out, so for me, this is a great chocolate snack when I get the cravings.

My mom loves it too. Great price for the size as well considering vanilla bean prices have spiked so much.Edit: infused two beans in 2 and a half ounces of organic sunflower oil for three days for a face oil (low heat for three hours per day) and it is a beautiful smell!

The variety of flavors and the attractive packaging makes this perfect for giving as a gift. The candy arrived unbroken and unmelted even though the temperature was still warm when they were delivered.The candy was definitely a hit in our house. I love dark chocolate so my favorite is the dark chocolates which are delicious. The milk chocolate is also tasty and is the perfect choice for those who don’t like the stronger taste of the darker chocolate. I don’t care for any type of coconut candy, but my husband said it was very good with a rich, coconut flavor. The quantity and variety of flavors makes this great for a gift.

",0.82152748160,grocery,"This was received in good condition from Amazon. I love the way Ferraro Rocher presents their hazelnut milk chocolate candies. The foil rapped candy inside the plastic case really gives it an upscale look, over a candy bar wrapped in paper. This looks like a gift immediately! Just wipe with a dry polishing cloth and put a red or gold bow and your present is ready to go! I put these out on the table after having friends over for dinner and game night and by the end of the evening they were gone. I guess that speaks for itself about taste and freshness. The “best by” date was 4/21, something I’ve developed a habit of checking on things that come in the mail. I recommend these and will buy a couple more before Christmas!

I got them for my daughter, who had just told me that she was getting divorced in the saddest possible way, and these actually cheered her up immensely! She was so surprised, and they brought a big smile to her face. Then we both dived in along with a few of her friends and my husband, and these bad boys just disappeared.They are very tasty, beautifully presented and a perfect gift when you don’t know what to get.

",0.85220003160,grocery,"This is a delicious set of fine quality chocolates. It comes in a nice, hard plastic box that isn't likely to be crushed during transport. The white ones have a coconut coating with a creamy, white chocolate filling. The gold ones are chocolate with a creamy chocolate filling, and the black ones are chocolate with a solid filling (not chewy). The coconut ones were my favorite. The hazelnut chocolate flavor is present in all three of the colors. These chocolates go great with coffee. Each of the chocolates are individually wrapped so you could put these out in a bowl for a social gathering or just leave them in the plastic packaging.

Or to just give us a gift in general.I highly recommend this!If you found this review helpful please remember to vote for it.
",0.98118150260,grocery,"I typically prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate.  However, Ferrero Rocher makes an exceptional milk chocolate that pairs perfectly with each full hazelnut inside each candy.  The chocolate hazelnut combination is delicious, especially if you like Nutella, but I think it's ten times better.  The chocolate melts in your mouth, and then you bite into the hazelnut to taste the delicious flavors meld.  The box presentation is always remarkable, too, as it makes for a great gift.  It's a hard plastic, so it won't get crushed, making it easily shippable to family during the holidays.
",0.96985840860,grocery,"I've had Ferrero Rocher many times before and these are the same nutella-filled wafer balls coated in chocolate and chopped nuts that I would expect. I love the contrast between the smooth creamy filling and the cirspy wafers. Each is individually wrapped in foil and sits on a paper cup which keeps it fresh and the cup allows me to rest half of it while I pause between bites. It's a two-bite experience, but it is good to savor. The packaging is hard plastic, which is somewhat wasteful, but does a good job of protecting the delicate candies.
",0.83337110360,grocery,"I can sum this review up in one word, Yummy! I had the variety pack and they were all GOOD. The milk chocolate hazelnut was delicious, the coconut was to die for and the dark chocolate was simply heavenly. All of the chocolate candy just melted in my mouth when eating it (double yum). The candy came boxed in a clear top container and the candy was organized so darn cute and each piece of candy was individually wrapped in rich color fancy wrappers to represent the different flavors. No complaints here. I'm a fan

It's a zero calorie energy drink, so of course it won't have any sugar and won't taste like a regular Coke.Overall, this is exactly what I was looking for. I tried this flavor at a QT before I purchased it in bulk online (which I would recommend with anything you're going to be buying in bulk so you don't waste a whole case like that other reviewer).

",0.97393083669,grocery,"If you eat these chips with an accompaniment (such as guacamole, sliced avocado, chili, queso, cheese slices, etc.) they taste pretty much just like nacho cheese Doritos, only with a thinner, lighter, more ""crackery"" texture. They are still good by themselves, but there is a slight aftertaste. I would not call this health food, as it is obviously a processed food with a long list of ingredients (as is nacho cheese Doritos.) But if you are trying to cut back on carbs and find yourself wrestling with cravings for your old friend Nacho Cheese Doritos, these will hit the spot!For comparison, according to the Frito- Lay website, a 1oz (28g) serving of Nacho Cheese flavored Doritos has:140 calories, 8g fat, 1 g sat fat, 0 trans fat, 210 sodium, 0 cholesterol, 16g carbs, 1g fiber, 0 sugar, 2g proteinAccording to the back of my Quest Nacho Cheese Tortilla Style Protein Chips, 1 bag (32g) has:140 cal, 6g fat, 1g sat fat, 0 trans fat, 10mg cholesterol, 340g sodium, 5g carbs,  1g fiber, sugars <1g, 18g protein
",0.569,grocery,"I’m newly on the Keto diet.  Today, I am 31 days clean from my addiction to Dr. Pepper!!! With the keto diet, I didn’t think I would succeed because I’m not necessarily a meal eater.  So, I searched for things that were tasty, quick, and filling, but also reasonably priced. So far, for the crunchy craving (because pork rinds get lame very quick), these actually fulfilled that crunch crave.  Of course they aren’t like regular chips, but after 15 days of strict dieting and checking ketones, this was a treat! I dip the ranch flavored ones in garlic hummus... hey, it works.... or I sprinkle shredded cheese on them and bake them in the oven and make like a ghetto nacho plate with some hot sauce.  Add a bottle of sparkling ice cherry limeade and it’s like you’re not even dieting! If I was not on a weight loss mission, of course I would choose the real ranch flavored corn chips, but these are a great substitute.  Hope this helps!
",0.95307791269,grocery,"So I was nervous to try these. I did like the Quest BBQ chips, I thought they were pretty decent but not enough to buy cases of them. I read the reviews on here and went out on a limb and bought a case. These are AMAZING! I can't believe they are 'healthier' and 'protein' chips. They really taste like an indulgence. I rarely eat chips only as a special treat so being able to eat these guiltlessly is awesome. They are super cheesy and give you cheesy finger residue like you're eating doritos or cheetos.... so nostalgia without feeling bad about it after! They are a little fragile so dipping them in something requires you to be gentle, but that doesn't really bother me as I pretty much just eat them plain anyway. I wish they were cheaper... but I love them anyway!
",0.75159716669,grocery,"Low Carb / Keto friends - I'm sure you all ended up here because you started off with Quest Protein Bars. I'm so glad they have expanded into making cookies and chips.CONSISTENCY - It doesn't give you the tortilla chip vibe, it's more like a tortilla chip with a cheez-it cracker type finish.FLAVOR - Nacho cheese flavor is in line with other chips. It does get a little salty for me by the end of the bag. I have tried Nacho Cheese and Ranch and think I prefer the Ranch flavoring more, but like both for the sake of variety.Either way, finding variety of snacks to do low carb / keto diets is tough, so this is great for snacking.
",0.82861131469,grocery,"I am THE pickiest eater ever. I have the palette of a 5-year-old and have issues with food textures and consistencies. I was a little nervous to try these, but went out on a limb because I was desperate for keto snacks I could easily grab. I work night shift and sometimes get junk food cravings. These taste JUST like cool ranch Doritos. The chips themselves are a little thinner than Doritos, but I honestly like them even better! I can't believe these are so low carb. They are a little expensive for chips, but I don't eat a bag every day. Just a couple times a week to get through cravings. I love mixing these into taco bowls too!
",0.10294750369,grocery,"You cannot beat these!!! I have been on my version of low carb diet, and these work in great. Everyone in the family agrees that there is really no difference between these and lets say a bag of baked lays except the flavor is MUCH stronger on these (which is a plus). Nacho cheese is my favorite so far. I had the cheddar and sour cream and BBQ. These are almost the same as cheddar and sour cream but the sour cream part gives those a little bit of a funky after taste. If you like BBQ chips a lot you'll probably love those too, but I'm not a huge fan of BBQ chips. These nacho cheese ones are a great snack while I am working at my desk after a workout. It really feels like I am cheating until I remind myself it isn't by looking at the nutrition facts. They are expensive in comparison to other chips, but hey eating healthy typically is expensive. Having something you can enjoy is crucial to sticking to a diet. Also I am excited to try these as a coating on baked chicken!
",0.90856587969,grocery,"Of all the high-protein snacks that I've ever tried, these are the BEST! It amazes me that they have 19 grams of protein. I like them even better than ""real"" tortilla chips because they're thinner and crisper, and they are a perfect ""tide-me-over-til-supper"" afternoon snack with the protein that keeps your blood sugar level, preventing you from cramming high-sugar items into your body. They're a bit pricey, so I have to ration them, but they are helping me keep from gaining back the weight I lost last winter. So happy that Quest created these - am ordering a new box of them today.
",0.90713298369,grocery,"All I have to say is WOW. When I bought these I expected them to taste like awful diet stuff but I really miss Takis so I said screw it let's try it. HOLY COW. These taste just like the Lime Chilli Doritos and the Cheddar Cheese are even better. I love these so much im going to buy the ranch pack next. The consistency is a little airier and less crunchy than the traditional but it's a Low Carb food so what can you expect? Some of them do get a little crushed during shipping but I dont mind and these also make excellent ""breading"" for keto baked chicken nuggets.
",0.9157856769,grocery,"These are OK if you absolutely need a chip-like snack for Keto or low carb, but they just aren't that flavorful and taste artificial. If I'm very hungry (after a cardio workout) I will eat a bag no problem, but if I'm not, I never have an urge to eat these.It's a shame because other reviews made them sound mouthwatering - they just aren't to me. The quality of the chip itself is also just a little too brittle and for being so thin, you would think they could include more per bag. For that reason the value is not there either.
",0.16247120569,grocery,"Chips?  mostly crumbs.  packages do not travel well.  over half of the contents were broke and most of what was broken were crumbs that you cannot even pick up.  Shame since they test great and are packed with protein.  maybe i can use them to bread veggies.......

Then I found a fully intact bug stuck to one of the fruit snacks, looks like it died in the bag. Nasty. I understand that things happen, but where is the quality control? I never review stuff like this but at least 7 out of an 80 count box were thrown out. Don’t buy.

However I can tell you from personal experience that eating 10+ bags in one sitting is not easy on your stomach or your general health. These are marketed as 'healthy' for you as you can tell by the front of the box that has many flashy colors that draw the eye and purports to use 'real fruit' and are just chock full of vitamins. A glance at the back of the box however will reveal the two main ingredient as fruit juice and sugar. Many MANY types of sugar. As long as you know these not fruit 'snacks' and instead should be treated as fruit 'candy' then purchase away.
",0.76767325470,grocery,"I love these snacks, so I recently bought them for kids at an afterschool program as a treat. The previous ordered was just fine [serial number: PN18C26xxx], but the recent 2 boxes I've purchased had issues [both with serial numbers: PN18G26xxx]. I wouldn't have noticed it until the kids started complaining about how their mouths became dry after eating the Welch's Fruit Snacks and asked for water. We got complaints from parents over the next several days for providing the kids with these snacks...After this incident, I taste-tested several packages myself. The issue seems to come from the purple-grape flavor in packages with serial number PN18G26xxx, which were noticeably more dry than the purple-grape flavor from the packages with serial number PN18C26xxx. Some of the other flavors from the PN18G26xxx packs were also slightly dry, but they weren't as bad as the purple-grape. Some were soft though as they should be.In the end, it was just an issue with the quality of the packages we received. The actual product is one of the best out there if you get one without issues.
",0.19589874170,grocery,"You know when you open up the pack and they’re all yellow and orange like the fruit snack god is confirming that life hates you???

",0.570,grocery,"We buy these all the time, but these ones are so stale they are rock hard:( The expiration date is 1/29/19 and we just received them yesterday 12/30 so they are definitely on the older side for that use by date. Otherwise these are great! Do not buy from this seller!!
",0.83418947570,grocery,"I love these so much I eat one or two everyday for snack.  I have trouble finding them at my local stores and the one place that carries them only has a small box with 5 in it.  This huge box is the best deal and lasts me about a month.  My favorite is the purple but the red is pretty good too.  I don’t like the orange one but I’m just not a tropical punch fan, if you are then you would probably love it.  My daughter likes them so we gave them to her class for snack time and she said all the kids wanted her to bring more.  I hope Welch’s keeps making these and I’m so glad Amazon has the big box for a good price!
",0.84284126870,grocery,"This is my second box of these Fruit Snacks I have purchased recently. The first box, I believe of 80, seemed to start out ok. I’m not sure when I started noticing how terrible they tasted, but they got progressively worse. I even thought maybe these aren’t even authentic Welch’s Fruit Snacks. I can’t imangine how Welch’s could allow such an awful product actually being provided to the public. There are some that taste like like jellied Crisco. Some have kind of a over ripe fruit flavor and are off color. Some are so hard you can’t even chew them! And let me say, before now, I’ve eaten many Fruit Snacks and have always loved them. I’m seriously thinking about calling Welch’s and complaining. I’m probably going to throw the rest in the garbage. So my advice to you is think twice before you purchase these and buy at your own risk!
",0.13505023770,grocery,"Yes, a good price.  But someone switched the box.  The expiration date (or best by) on the individual packages is September 2017.  The date on the box is April 2018.  I bought a larger bag of these snacks while on travel and they were much fresher tasting and softer.  I'll buy these at Costco for now on -- if there's a freshness issue it's much easier to return.
",0.97000980470,grocery,"This is not a review on Welch's fruit snacks- I absolutely LOVE these and ordered this package specifically so I could have larger bags to snack on. If you're looking for a review solely on the fruit snacks themselves, these are the BEST in my opinion.Having said that, I ordered this package and opened up the Island Fruits variety as these are my favorite. I noticed right off the bat that the colors were a bit...off. They were all sort of dingy and brown looking- not bright and colorful like they usually are. I thought maybe it was due to being stored in a warm warehouse or something so I ate a few and realized the flavor was just awful. it just tasted almost like rotten fruit.I was confused, so I looked on the back of the package and the expiration date read June of 2018. It is currently June 2019, which means these fruit snacks expired A YEAR AGO. I contacted Welch's to make sure I was reading the expiration date properly, and they confirmed I was and that the fruit snacks had indeed expired. I cannot believe Amazon shipped a perishable product that had expired THAT long ago. I understand things slip under the radar, but how long was this box sitting in their warehouse? I'm super weary of purchasing food products from Amazon in the future.While these are delicious when they're fresh, and I have purchased these before from Amazon with no issues, PLEASE be sure to check the expiration dates on the back of the packaging before eating or giving them to your children etc.

When receiving this package, it was in poor shape. As the images above shown. The box feels a little damp as well. I'm not very pleased. But, this is how I got it. The expiration date is fine, since it's 07/10/19. When opening the slightly opened box, a few packages had hard gummies. I didn't even have to open the packets up, I can just tell by grabbing a packet and it was super hard. When opening the packet, the gummies were hard as a rock. 5 packets I had to throw away. I'm a little disappointed. But, I still have high spirits for the rest of the items to be delivered with non crushed boxes.

Instantly you can’t breathe well, because when you inhale it’s like fire is going to leave your mouth when you exhale. Then you don’t want to talk because you can’t decide if you’re going to have a panic attack or puke. Milk doesn’t even help.

I was told by my husband to drink it anyway because what was about to happen in my stomach was unholy. I was stuck in a fetal position with the ac blasting and a fan on my face for 12 hrs. Every slight movement awoke the devil in my stomach and my body turned into a furnace with cramps comparable to child labor contractions. It made eating the chip the easiest thing in the world.

",0.26404714678,grocery,"I would never give an 'energy' bar five stars but these have really won me over. I'l begin by saying that I have tried almost every brand out there and keep going back to these. I only mention that as these can melt if left in a car or backpack, making them a bit harder to unwrap and eat without a napkin. Other than that, they are fantastic.I tend to reach a critical low blood sugar easily and need something to provide sustenance until I can get a real balanced meal. Yes, they are not high in fiber, so they do not compete with high fiber bars— but those tend to have little protein or they cost twice the price.What I love about these TT bars (I buy only the Peanut Butter favor) is that they have a low glycemic index. So even as they are chocolate coated, they do not spike my sugar levels and dump me down later as most sweet bars will. The filling is easily digested and never gummy or sticky. They have 20gms protein, so Cliff bars (my past favorite) at about 7.5 gas protein, can't hold a candle to these for effectiveness as a meal replacement or supplement. On the go, I grab one of these and I'm fine. They live in all my camera bags and luggage so I'm always covered while traveling. I only avoid these when on extended travels in really hot climates. (For those conditions, I prefer Kind bars)I am not sensitive to the sweeteners used, and have no negative effects from easting them as another reviewer mentioned. I have purchased about eight boxes of these at supermarkets and will not buy from Amazon due to the price.Experiment with the flavors. I found these to be the least sweet tasting, which is perfect for me.Hope you like them too.

Also, still hit or miss on whether I receive a perfectly fine box or a box that is full of stale, white powdered bars that taste like garbage.

",0.07345259278,grocery,"They're not a lemony delight....more like Lemon Okay.  The lemon flavor is pretty mild, although at least it's noticeable this time, unlike some other ThinkThin bars I've tried, such as the Protein and Fiber Cupcake Batter flavor, which is a comically thin piece of vanilla Play-Doh.  Realistically, this is probably as good as we can hope for in the realm of protein bars---I have yet to find one with a strong lemon flavor.The texture is pretty good, which is why I give them 4 stars.  Unlike the roofing shingle or compressed Play-Doh texture I've come to expect from protein bars, this one actually a satisfying texture with a very slight crispyness to it---similar but less than the puffed rice particles in a Nestle Crunch bars, if that makes sense.  Unlike the aforementioned ThinkThin Cupcake Batter bars, which were absurdly thin (the thickness of 8 credit cards)  these bars are substantial enough to make you feel like you're actually eating something.  When I need to, I can grab one with a cup of coffee in the morning and be mostly okay until lunch.I'll repurchase them because I haven't found a better lemon flavored bar out there.  I'm not big on chocolate and chocolate adjacent flavors of most protein bars, so I'm always on the hunt for something in the citrus family.  If choosing between the High Protein and the Protein and Fiber, go with the High Protein bars, because the Protein and Fiber ones were a real disappointment.

If you are looking for a thick protein bar to replace a meal or while on the go and you don't have time and need protein to hold you over, go with this 20g bar.  Just to note though, there is two types of Peanut Butter versions: chunky and creamy.  My hubby likes creamy over chunky, I like both.

",0.78470826181,grocery,"I really enjoyed this creamer.  It was super easy to use: just add a Tbsp to coffee and blend, voila!  I was pleasantly surprised by the cacao flavor: it gives it the decadence of dark chocolate in a smooth cup of coffee, without being overpowering.  I was truly impressed with the taste.  You could always tailor your coffee with the sweetener of your choice, or add protein (like bone broth powder) to make it a meal replacement.
",0.98962473981,grocery,"Did you make the change to Keto too? I was worried about having to have my coffee black, mostly because it gets a little too acidic for me sometimes, but I don't have to worry any more. I was worried at first about having to mix it, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I enjoy that the bottle is a little on the smaller side, so I know it stays fresh. The oils that are used create a silky, slightly buttery flavor that really steps up my coffee game. Not sure I can go back to a regular coffee again!
",0.75803983281,grocery,"Really enjoying this coffee creamer. I am doing keto and I add this to my morning coffee because it helps me get in some good fat with the ghee butter and mct oil. The mct oil is also great if you need a little extra energy. The cocao adds a good chocolate flavor to add to your coffee! Follow the instructions and blend your coffee after adding this because it will leave some oil at the top of your coffee if you do not blend it like you should. Great product! Thank you!-Lindsey

",0.99018353282,grocery,"I received the chips yesterday and promptly decided to make some low carb chocolate chip cookies.  However I first tasted the chips and was pleasantly pleased with the flavor as it tasted exactly like semisweet chocolate.  The chunks were a bit large so I chopped them briefly in little electric chopper before adding it to the almond flour mix.  The end result; very good!  There is no after taste, texture was good. and no stomach issues.  I am a satisfied customer and recommend this chocolate.

You would never know this is a sugar-free product. It's great to be able to not have to compromise taste or quality while eating a sugar free diet. The chunk sizes are irregular, which adds a nice texture to baked goods when I use them instead of chocolate chips.

No two proteins are the same. I know whey is better than soy, but I'll be seeing how plant based protien works with the body before buying again. Overall, it's a good price for what it is. If you're craving something sweet, but want to avoid diving into a Snickers, this is a great substitute.  If you're lacking fiber for the day and don't have any broccoli laying around, grab one of these. If you're wanting something that tastes as described, lower your expectations by a mile.

However... when I bought these bars off of Amazon, the box came kind of smushed and the bars inside were super DRY and crumbling apart. I know that isn’t how the bars should be so I’m really disappointed that’s what I got. The expiration date was fine, it said August 2020, so idk if it was just this batch or what. I had only bought them off amazon for the free shipping, but if that’s the quality I get, I will pay the extra $6-7 to buy directly from thinkthin knowing the quality is going to be better/as expected. The direct site also ships the bars with a cold pack to ensure they won’t melt!!
",0.79996728986,grocery,"OMG absolutely delicious!!!  Chocolate covered peanut butter mousse...a healthier version of Reeses!  Warning though..ADDICTING!!! On my second bar as I write this..
",0.92745238586,grocery,"So I have tried about 25 different bars for my keto lifestyle. Even though I knew it wasn't clean keto the original think bars kept my sweet tooth at bay. When I found out it was discontinued and the replacement bar had tons of sugar, I was depressed.  Then I saw these on Amazon. Let me just tell you, they are D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S. For Real. Taste almost like a whipped peanut butter Reese's. No wreaking havoc on the blood sugar, and won't give you the runs (that's always a plus!) What else can you ask for?!
",0.12871575486,grocery,"These are amazing. They taste like a more moussey peanut butter cup. Not quite as big as the normal think bars, but still filling.
",0.92784452486,grocery,"Pros:- Flavor:  Really does taste like a peanut-butter-chocolate pie (albeit a little light on the choco flavor)- Texture:  AMAZING for a protein bar; fluffy with bits of crunchy (I assume) peanuts, rather than unpleasantly dense like the usual bar.- Calorie count:  180 calories for a pretty satisfying snack isn't bad- Carb count:  I tend to be rather keto-skeptical, to be frank, but hey... if you're countin' carbs, get to know this bar :)Cons:- Sugar alcohol amount:  7 grams. Ouch. It'd be easy to down two of these slim bars, but let's just say that that'd likely be a very... crappy choice for many. Not quite gettin' the gist?  Er, King of the Throne. Porcelain God. Okay, since you probably can't stomach more of this, I'll end my gastro-intestinal commentary here.- GMO fearmongering:  Sheesh. For something that is, frankly, not a health food, the baseless GMO scaremongering is just silly.- Kinda messy:  Even when trying to eat this carefully, a bunch of crunchy bits liberated themselves onto my dining room table.  And given the chocolate coating, I can't imagine these bars would do well in hot cars, hot gym bags, hot, well, anyplace.- Slightly funny aftertaste:  Probably due to the combo of sugar alcohols + stevia.And what's disappointing is that they're using the CHEAP (and more problematic) sugar alcohols, vs the more expensive but healthier sugar alcohol, xylitol (which is usually easier on the stomach AND helps prevent cavities!)---Okay, that may look like way more cons than pros, and yes, quantitatively that's true.  But did I mention that these things are delicious?  Seriously, from a taste and satisfaction standpoint, I'd likely reach for these in a moment of weakness before many candy bars!  Then again, that should probably give us pause...
",0.8099023186,grocery,"My husband described these bars perfectly.  ""They're like less exciting peanut butter cups.""  Now for the record, I was NEVER excited by peanut butter cups, but this is an accurate description.  They have all the delicious goodness of a giant peanut butter cup, but not very much of the sugar.  And they absolutely slay hunger.  You won't get two-thirds done with this little bar and you will be FULL.  No kidding.  It happened to me.  I may not even have eat dinner later tonight, kind of full.Here in Los Angeles, these are stored in the fridge.  The chocolate covering will make a soupy mess.I brew a double shot of Cuban espresso and treat this bar like a wonderful dessert.  See, now I am excited about this bar!  lol!  Enjoy!
",0.92012369686,grocery,"These think! Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie Keto protein bars were offered to me in my Amazon Vine selection.  (The brand think! was formerly known as think Thin.)  These think! bars taste GREAT!  They’re soft, yet have a bit of crunch.  Although the bars are mainly intended for keto diets, they also work for people with diabetes (like my husband) and vegetarians (like my daughter).  Each bar contains 180 calories, 14 g fat, 10 g protein, 3 g fiber and 14 g carbohydrates (4 g net carbs).  The bars are GMO free, gluten free and Kosher.  They contain no artificial sweeteners, but do contain sugar substitutes (erythritol and Stevia leaf extract).  These are definitely one of the better tasting protein bars we have tried.
",0.71737790186,grocery,"the taste of these is pretty decent for a low-carb bar, but they don't hit 5 stars for me or my wife because of the greasy-feeling texture.  I assume that the bar is crammed with cocoa butter to simulated the (to me, somewhat gross) texture of the old unhealthy hydrogenated PB's of my youth, which is now mimicked by loading some brands up with palm oil and such for that artery-coating feeling. Thus, despite the flavor and aftertaste being good, there's just that hint of eating grease out of a jar.  I think it'd be a better product if they kept the calories lower by not loading it up with shortening. Then again, I suppose Keto bars are supposed to hit you with a bunch of fat.So digesting all that (presuming I do!) this comes out with an initial 4 stars. If the sugar alcohols give us the trots, or there are other untoward outcomes, I'll append those experiences to this review.But for those who liked the sensation of eating hydrogenated-oil peanut spread, this does kinda nail that.
",0.24146711886,grocery,"Most of the Think! Bars I've seen have sugar alcohol from maltitol. Healthline says: it is 90% as sweet as sugar with almost half the calories. While products that contain maltitol claim to be ""sugar-free,"" your body absorbs some of this sugar alcohol, causing blood sugar spikes (4Trusted Source).The Keto Think! Bars use erythritol, though, which DO NOT spike blood sugar. It's the same as stevia. This is so much better.So watch what you order. Think! tends to show total sugar on the front but now where the sweetness comes from.

It does melts in summertime during shipping and I live in New York which is not even a very hot region.As for the bar itself: The flavor is delicious and the caramel & salt adds a nice kick in taste. The size of the bar is 1.76oz. and 1.5"" x 3"" in size, which is quite a bit smaller than the bigger ones sold in drug stores or health food stores. The 19g of protein is great, and so is the low 3g of sugar. As a diabetic, I was a bit concerned about the 50grams of carbs, but it did not effect my blood sugars after a while. ( I tested my glucose a few hours later, and I Think it may even lowered it! ) Overall, its still a great buy if you can get them at about a buck a piece. Makes a great snack !ps. Amazon should ship with cold packs during summer months to avoid melting.
",0.76369094896,grocery,"I have to say I am pretty impressed with the flavor! Awesome macros and really inexpensive. It can bebe a bit too sweet at the end as it is a caramel flavor, but overall looking to trying all the flavors, 100% recommended, coming from someone who has tried a lot of protein bars this ones might be my favorite.Oh and it comes with a coupon inside btw.
",0.9784847596,grocery,"I normally like chocolate, but the chocolate flavor on this bar is not so good, and the texture is even worse -- gummy and chewy in all the worst ways. I get that some sacrifices have to be made to get a bar with 21g of protein, but it's too much when the bar tastes this bad. I still have a few left over from the box I ordered because I dread eating them that much.There are many other ""protein bars"" out there with much better flavor and a similar nutritional profile. Maybe not 21g similar, but not everyone is a professional bodybuilder.
",0.09567019396,grocery,"Personally think for the money, these are the best bars on the market.  I consume one to two bars at night before bedtime.  If I get up hungry during the night, this is my snack.  These bars taste great,  but had a few bars in the same box with a bad after taste.

I have revised my review because it wasn’t the product that was different but my taste buds. I was taking medication (had the flu) that actually made everything taste bad and once I was off the meds this coffe is just as amazing as it has always been. The company reached out to me immediately and offered to resolve any issue I may have had. I will absolutely order again as I am now enjoying my coffee as much as ever since I’m off those meds and well.

No, it's not going to be a caffeine punch, it's the flavor I'm speaking of.  GOOD coffee in my opinion is robust, but not bitter - doesn't leave an aftertaste - etc.  This flavor by Market & Main is good enough that I drove to EVERY vendor in my home town that I'd found them at and bought them all - when I ran out, I ordered them here!  Yes you can get them online elsewhere - and for almost the same price - but buying them 6 boxes at a time has stocked my shelves up nicely.  I'm down to the last box, so time to reorder soon!

These were a few dollars more than what I usually buy but I like coconut so I figured why not save a trip to the store. I don't like super strong coffee, I'm a medium roast girl, but even to me these things are soooo watery.  I used a clear glass mug and you could see straight through it, it was the color of tea.  The coconut flavor is nice but it tastes like coconut water instead of coffee.  Won't buy this brand again.
",0.11639791797,grocery,"I actually tried two cups and both were the same (I threw the rest away).  If it wasn't for a vague cloudiness, you could read through the ""coffee"". There was almost no coffee flavor and only a weirdly artificial caramel flavor.  Someone gave me some of the Starbucks carmel k-cups (not normally a Starbucks fan), and they are fine.  Not sure what these are, but coffee isn't it.
",0.17033231397,grocery,"Not much taste. Brewed on the smallest setting possible and the coffee was ok. Found grounds in many of the brewed cups. Disappointed in that we could not purchase a smaller quantity (like one box) to try it out. So have been giving the boxes away with the recipients saying the same thing - didn’t taste very good. Bought the coconut and peppermint bark coffees. Will not be purchasing this brand again.

",0.844267309100,grocery,no review,0.7239852791,toys,"This is a very fun and interactive Advent calendar set.  Like most such Advent sets, it is boxed with 24 compartments, one to be opened each day starting December 1st up to Christmas Eve.  Each compartment features a build-able object with an average of about 10 Lego pieces per object.  There is a good variety of building projects, including people (and Santa of course!), vehicles, furnishings, food, etc.  My favorites include the fireplace with cool glowing embers and the wacky curling athlete with curling stones and broom.  The box is designed with a clever fold-down flap that serves as a base for displaying the objects.  We've traditionally used Advent calendars with chocolates and this one is so much more fun and creative (and low-calorie).  The only thing missing (at least for our Christian family) is any religious element pointing to the birth of Jesus.  I've already decided to enhance our experience by having my kids build a few Nativity elements to add to the display using other Lego pieces we have.  In any case, we can't wait to enjoy this Lego Advent calendar this Christmas!

What is great is that you know ahead of time that none of the dolls/pets/OMGs will  be a repeat of something they already have.  It took my daughter about an hour to open all the boxes/packages.  It was exciting and we all watched as she opened all the surprises.  There are 51 packages to open and then the OMG dolls come in hard plastic cases (generously labelled as ""playsets"") with their stands, clothes, hangars.  Not sure exactly how the count is 70 surprises but there are so many that it was definitely worth the money.  Make sure to follow the instructions enclosed to open all  the boxes in order.  If you skip around you might lose track and miss opening one or more packages.  (Minor issue for some will be the sheer quantity of packaging. The layout and variety of ways to open the boxes was clever and sophisticated, and while opening all the boxes to find a bag to open is exciting, this is not a situation where the packaging has taken the environment into account.)

Second, the bottom of the hair was in some type of a curl and it was glued to stay that way.  So the hair was hard and crusty and needed to be washed before using it.  Lastly, it is small.  My other daughter has a different princess hair styling toy that is much larger, sturdier, and was around the same price.  Would not recommend.

So when she took it off and dropped one end, every single bead fell off. I'm going to try to find some sort of stopper bead. No clue if this exists or not. But she loves the princesses and loved making them. The princesses were cute too.
",0.79883772110,toys,"This was given to my 4 year old daughter. It’s a very cute set and it’s nice that you can remake the necklaces each time but the downfall is when she wears one and it comes undone the beads just fall off and she gets very frustrated.
",0.7553987510,toys,"This kit is excellent!  My four-year-old granddaughter got one for her birthday.  She loves to put the beads on, wear her “favorite” pony, then disassemble it.  She then puts different beads on, and wears that.  The kit comes with the necklaces, the beads, and the ponies.  Easy assembly and snaps together. The container keeps everything together.  Bought more for my other granddaughter and a friend’s daughter for presents.  I’m sure they’ll love them too.
",0.98238873510,toys,"Bought this for my niece for her 5th birthday.  She LOVES Disney princesses and this was a HIT!  My sister, her mother, also liked that this is not a really messy jewelry set and that the necklaces were easy to assemble.  When I asked her about the latches, she said that they were really no problem and that she had just asked my niece to ask for help when she was ready to take her necklaces off.
",0.9698234810,toys,"My 5 year old likes to make necklaces for me and other people to wear. She will also wear them around. When she is done making necklaces she uses the flat rubber princess as dolls.Some of the rubber necklace clasps fell off the rubber string and got lost. (They clasp by a rubber tube you insert the end of the rubber string into. ) I don’t have a way to get replacement clasps so eventually all the princesses will be dolls.(This would be a good project for a airplane trip as they take a while to make each necklace, the novelty wears off after they are made but you could get an hour of happy time)
",0.23753365910,toys,"This is PERFECT for a newly 4 year old. LOVE that the clasp is just a rubber pressure clasp and there’s no hooks to tie on afterwards.  Pieces are cute and super easy to handle. The carrying case is an added bonus.
",0.96829503810,toys,"I was so disappointed when my daughter put a bracelet together. Once everything was on, you push the 2 ends together and it wouldn’t stay together. We tried all the bands and non of them stay together. Super fun to make it but they can’t be worn. And if so, it’s just a matter of time before it comes apart and you have beads all over. Wish there was some way to snap it together so you knew it was securely on and not going to fall off and make my daughter cry.
",0.12756931810,toys,"I purchased this for my friends daughter. Each necklace charms are so cute!!! Wonderful way for the kids to be creative and for them to have a keepsake.
",0.95182931411,toys,"I am a huge LOL fan. This one is weird. Lots of glitter and fur you will be covered in it but that is nothing new for any glitter item from LOL. The hair is soft but I noticed this line has multiple problems with accessories not fitting or being impossible to get on. The earrings were a pain . The belt I gave up on. If you snap it together by itself it's super small and is only one place it fits around the waist.  I  gave up after about 10 minutes.  The hat will not stay on even with the strap. They pinned the hair to high so it won't let the hat sit flush like it should and will pop off. Cute for display but for play expect to be coved in glitter.  Lastly the box no longer has a functional mirror and with no velcro the box won't stay closed.  Oh and don't expect to get the fake snow in your package.
",0.14375686611,toys,"I was worried sometimes the price of the LOL products are a bit high and these are no exceptions. But for what you get I think it is well worth it! This doll IN PERSON is AMAZING so much better than photos or videos!  Her whole presence sings SHINE. Her turquoise metallic glitter hair is super thick and soft, her outfit, though out there a bit, just works somehow. I love her name Cosmic Nova, it fits her perfectly. Her leggings, outfit and even bright pink fur coat have sparkle!  And her face just glows with glitter gloss and eyeshadow! I really thought Snowlicious would be my favorite and I love her to in a totally different way. She has an understand Aspen elegance to her. But this Cosmic Queen is ALL GLAMOUR with a quirky air to her that fits the narrative of her being a girl from somewhere in the Cosmos!!  Unless your girl isn't the glitter type, there is no way she won't be crazy for this gorgeous Space Queen, Cosmic Nova!! And who are we kidding, if you are just a little girl at  heart like me, you will want your very own!!

",0.88795018212,toys,"I ordered this for my daughter in anticipation of Frozen 2. It was very easy to set up, no issues despite some of the reviews I’ve seen on here. She absolutely loves it! The app gives you tips on drawing, she is instructed to draw a component of a picture (skirt of a dress, snowflake, etc.) and when she is done, her drawing pops up on the screen. At that point there are several different ways to change the color and look and then her drawing is incorporated into an animation, “coming to life”. The sketch pad erases easily so she can go through pages again. She has made it through about eight activities and is really enjoying it. I am going to buy this for my niece for Christmas. It is definitely the perfect gift for any child who loves to draw and is into Frozen. She was begging to keep playing at bedtime!

We went to a L.O.L. Winter Disco event to purchase this doll and fortunately we were able to get the exact one of the four she wanted most.  She loves her hair (very soft), and her nails (pointy and pearly pink), and her lips/eyeshadow (glittery!), and her 'very fashionable' outfits (my daughter's words).  I will admit the doll is super cute but then again I love her original L.O.L tot dolls.  My husband even admitted it was a nice quality doll and looks 'bright and shiny'.  Ha!  My one nitpicking thing would be for MGA to make the hair thicker.  I love a really full head of hair and think they could have put a little more on the dolls but it's still very nice and an overall nice quality doll.  For my daughter's birthday she is getting the Swag and Dollie OMG dolls as well as the Glamper and will get the Amazing surprise, Crystal Star, and  Cosmic Nova dolls for Christmas so I guess that's saying something, too.  ;)

The 10 year old loves these things and is happy to spend her money (and a little of mine on them). I guess it is the ""surprise"" aspect that keeps them going strong. I am glad to see that the line has evolved into larger dolls and they continue to provide a ""complete"" play experience in one package. No need to buy accessories, everything comes in the box. The kids play with these things several times/week for hours.Yes, lots of small pieces but for me, if the kids love it I will deal with it. Not going to lie though, some do get tossed and they never say a word :)

As soon as I saw it available on Amazon I ordered it for her birthday, which isn't for a few weeks. But being a nice aunt, I gave it to her already and she played with it for literally 2 hours straight. My niece is about to be 8, and loved the snow and how the box itself is a display case.

The drawers in my calendar are 2x2x2” and the toys fit perfectly in each drawer with room to spare for a candy. Each day’s project is bagged separately and there is a picture of the completed project on the calendar flap. I cut them out and taped them to each bag and arranged them in the calendar in the order I liked best. Santa is last in the box, but I moved him up and also moved around the figures and other pieces in a more logical—to my mind anyway—order. Super happy with this for the price. Pretty sure the grandson will love it, too.

",0.8014686715,toys,"Elsa’s Wagon Adventure is a little more challenging than the Duplo sets our almost four year old is used to, but she was more than ready to build something that is Frozen themed.  116 pieces is just enough for this age group and beyond.  Elsa is the main attraction at our house, and she wears a sparkly cape.  We wondered why her hair isn’t white—Lego chose to make it yellow.  Like all Lego kits, the guided directions are thorough and easy to follow.  Once built, the wagon is a sturdy ride for Elsa, and Sven stays firmly connected to it with a movable ball and joint piece.  This is a very colorful set—the Nordic brick designs and forest background piece enhance the other main accessories.This was our first attempt at a Lego junior set designed particularly for girls, and we’re impressed enough to add more.  I wanted to start with something smaller because we weren’t even sure building toys still held an interest.  This was a good choice—the starter brick base added confidence in building skills, and sparked enthusiasm to try other sets, especially if they’re from Frozen.
",0.99084210415,toys,"This is a fantastic LEGO Disney Frozen II Series with a wagon adventure theme for Elsa.  If you are a fan of LEGO Disney, Frozen / Frozen II, Elsa, Sven, or of LEGO, or you think you might be, then this is a great set.  The set has some unique pieces including Elsa's braided hair, a printed panel depicting birch trees and fall leaves, and printed wagon pieces.  Great theme elements include colorful fall foliage, Sven and a baby reindeer, marshmallow roasting on a stick, and a campfire.  I also like that the colors in the set are very lovely rich jewel tones.The pieces come in 2 main bags, with smaller bags inside the main bags.  Sven and the baby reindeer come in their own separate bags, and there's also a ""Perfect Start"" plate that is not bagged.  When you build it, the instructions will have you build using the pieces from the bags labeled ""1"", then once those bags are completed, continue with the pieces from the bags labeled ""2"", and so on.  I've found that it's useful to open all of the bags for the particular number, but keep the pieces a little bit separate.  The pieces aren't randomly distributed between bags - instead, all of the pieces of a particular type may be in one or two bags, so if you dump the bags out and keep the pieces slightly separate, once you've found which pile your piece is in, you may find the rest of them in that same pile or in that one and one other.The instruction book has nice imagery, clear instructions, and a QR code so you can read the building instructions from a tablet or other device using the LEGO Life app.  Within the LEGO Life app, for this set, you can access the instructions on your device and download a pdf version of the instructions.  On the device you can rotate and zoom to see all angles of a step or build, which can be really useful if you're not sure you have it just right.  Plus, when you complete a part of the build, you get glittery animated celebrations!  For the included instruction booklet, all text is provided in English, French, and Spanish, and text showing how to get the LEGO Life app is shown in 11 languages.  The instructions themselves, in usual LEGO style, are all pictures and symbols.  For this set, since it is a  set geared toward ages 4+, the instruction book shows only a couple of pieces being added at a time so it's easy to see what's next.
",0.90772163915,toys,"This is such a great Lego set.  I like that there aren't too many pieces to put together and that the pieces in the set are a little larger than most Lego sets.  It takes a young, elementary school aged child about 30 minutes to put the pieces together (15 minutes for those more experienced with Legos).  Honestly, I've found that's all the attention most younger children want to spend putting a set together.Lots of imaginary play scenarios can be created with this set since there are three figures included with it--Elsa, Sven & the reindeer.  How cool is that!  Kids don't need to have watched Frozen or be familiar with the figures before playing with the set.  It does, however, make it more fun to be familiar with the story since then the characters relationship with each other makes more sense.  But, perhaps, there's even more imagination that needs to be called upon for those not familiar with the story.I'd recommend this set for a K-3rd grader.  A 4 year old may need some help from an adult or older child to put it together.  Older kids and adults who are fans of Frozen will also love the set.  Having 3 figures included in any set is really a big deal.Enjoy!
",0.9619189515,toys,"As reviewed by my 9yo: ""I like the baby Sven, that's my favorite part of the whole set!""It's interesting how Lego chose to release the sets several months before the movie comes out... It means that we don't know some of these characters, and we're getting to know them via these Lego sets!it sort of interesting to have a lego set that contains spoilers for an unreleased movie.Vista special pieces include baby's Sven, Sven, the tree trunk piece, and a backpack piece. My son also loves all the gems, and the orange leaf pieces.""I like that they used the space behind the hollow tree piece, it looks like it's the inside of a little reindeer stables or something. And the campfire with the marshmallor roasting stick is really cool!""
",0.96761846515,toys,"Very cute set- especially the reindeer! I'm always impressed with how well even the smallest of details look on Lego sets and this one doesn't disappoint, the items included and the characters look good. My daughter has a Frozen set from the first movie and I had accidentally thrown away Elsa's cape and it was tragic, so it's nice to have a replacement 😄 My daughter, who is in 3rd grade, is so excited about this set to go with her older one and that she has a new type of Elsa/outfit…plus the other set didn't have Sven, or baby reindeer, so that really made her happy! The quality is on-point and we received all pieces. She was able to put it together pretty quickly.

It has 116 pieces which is enough to keep your children busy and challenged, but not so much that they become frustrated or overwhelmed.

This set includes figurines of Elsa and Sven which they absolutely love. The box is a good size and makes for an attractive present when wrapped. This is a great choice for a birthday party present. The combination of LEGO and Disney provides everything a child could ask for.

She is enjoying playing with the set now that it's built. It comes with Elsa, Sven, and a baby reindeer as well as the carriage, stable, cookie (Inna box) carrot and marshmallow. Overall a fun set for kids who like Frozen, but we like the Rapunzel sets a little bit better.

",0.96985858719,toys,"In keeping with the primary theme of Frozen, it's no surprise to find this jewelry box sparkles with wintry theme. The box is based on an eye-catching white and the back side highlights the gear system which rotates the characters along with the locking mechanism that keeps the sliding drawer in place. There are three bags along with a small bag for the horse. The included sticker sheet is minimal with only four to apply. A word of caution: centering the mirror can take a bit of concentration and since it is so central to the set an adult may want to assist a younger builder. I was about 90% happy with my own attempt.A minidoll of Elsa with a beautiful two-patterned cape is accompanied by a figure of Nokk, a watery-looking horse character from the upcoming sequel Frozen II. Nokk is immovable so it is essentially a statue, but the clear blue looks fantastic as does the swept-forward tail. The silver eyes on Nokk are a great-looking highlight. To make Nokk ridable, the middle section can be removed - it looks a bit awkward but certainly does the trick for play.The gear system is fun and reminiscent of dancing ballerinas and other characters often found on non-brick jewelry boxes. Being able to easily spin the characters together lends itself to frequently changing the look of the box. The drawer functions well: it might be nice to add tiles to the floor to permit jewelry to be more accessible if one is so inclined.The box looks nice from three sides, the back is fairly functional but in a thoughtful touch the mirror sticker is two-sided, adding visual interest should one be looking from behind. A pleasing set that could easily be rebuilt into a small Frozen-themed building if you're not looking for a jewelry box but are interested in Elsa, Nokk, and the variety of winter/ice themed parts.

The pragmatist in me loves that not only are you making a vignette with the characters, but a functional object as well.  The little drawer in the jewellery box really opens and closes, and even has a lock on it to keep it closed.  Lego even gives you two rings to assemble, wear, and keep in your box.I have no illusion that this would hold up to actual use, but I suppose if you had a very careful kid, it could work.  The build was very easy, and as always, the instructions are so clear.  This would make a fantastic holiday gift for your Frozen/Lego fan.
",0.91809302619,toys,"I mean, I like it, or, at least my young Frozen-loving-daughter likes it, but unlike most Lego sets, there’s not to much to play with once you get over the initial impression.Don’t get me wrong, it is still a fun to build Lego, and, when complete, it is initially exciting to look at… but it doesn’t fill the void as a toy to play with, or as a really usable treasure chest.For example, it comes with a beautiful ice horse, but it really is just for show, and doesn’t allow for any movement in its body -more like an ornament or a statue, than a toy.  Additionally, the storage available in the chest is pretty limited, and you don’t have much usable space.That said, here’s the upside.  It comes with Elsa and Anna, and a cool see through horse that will excite the kiddos. It also comes with two rings that you can adorn with a “gem” Lego.  I thought that that was one of the best parts of the set.  They effectively made some Lego jewelry.  What a nice idea.It also LOOKS very nice.  Lots of ice Legos and muted blues and pinks.  Even with my complaints above, you have to put it into perspective with the price point.  I’d expect a lot more with a Lego set that cost twice as much.  I really can’t say that I expected too much from a $30 set, and a Lego and Frozen fan will likely be THRILLED to receive this as a gift.  And that is why I give it four stars.  For a reasonable price you get a really exciting looking gift.  Even if you put it aside after building, it will still be a cute showpiece to decorate the room with.
",0.98324763819,toys,"This Legos set comes with the parts packaged in three pouches.  Each pouch contains all of the pieces for one portion of the finished design: the top with turntables, the lockbox, and the base.  Starting at the top, the child constructs Elsa and the horse and then the platform.  These parts alone can be used in fantasy play even before the rest of the structuumre is built, so if the child has limited patience for building, constructed can be spread out over time with play in between.  The same is true of the lockbox with rings.  The finished product can be used to store special keepsakes as well as to play eith the two figures.  The step-by-step instructions show how each piece is assembled with pictures of each individual piece.  Legos has been supplying high quality building kits for three generations of my family, and they know how to do it right.
",0.79251909319,toys,"Let's be honest here, you definitely want this set for the horse, don't you? Whatever else is included here, all you needed to see was that horse, and this set was as good as purchased. I totally agree. Anyway, on with a review that you don't need anymore.So, I haven't seen the movie yet, which means that I don't really know how or if this set is in any way representative of scenes in the movie, but given that it is a large jewelry box, I'm guessing that it is more a Frozen-themed set than actually reflecting something in the movie. Given that, it's definitely an incredible set. Kids love to have a place to store little treasures, so add a Frozen theme, and who wouldn't want it. There's a drawer that opens when you swing the little locks out of the way, and there's a mirror built into the display, and a feature to spin Elsa and the horse like a little music box.The parts are pretty great as well. Elsa is here, this version only being in one other set, the horse, which I believe is called Nokk, which is only included here, as well as a brand new part of a translucent ""door"" which can be placed into the 1x6x7 archway piece, there's the Nexo shield in trans-dark blue for the first time, and new this year the 1x4x3 brick, which here is in white, and there are 7 included!The build would be simple and uninteresting except for the display on top with the horse and Elsa, but that adds a lot of interest to the build. It's a wonderful display piece afterward, and one which I think will see a lot of use from fans as a cute little storage for treasures.
",0.95083868519,toys,"This is such a cute Lego set and I rarely see sets where you are building drawers instead of just buildings that you can't really use. This Frozen jewelry box actually has a sliding drawer in it where you can keep little trinkets and jewelry. It does come with two plastic rings but it has plenty of room in the drawer to keep other little dainty things. The top of the jewelry box spins so it makes it Interactive and the drawer as a sort of locking mechanism so that it doesn't just fall open if you're carrying it. Putting it together was a snap and it took about an hour. For girly girls, this is a perfect gift and it is a rarity to find a Lego set that caters to jewelry lovers. I love that this is not just a toy but also a useful object.
",0.9399136320,toys,"My kids love Cry Babies, but they are so hard to find here in the USA! We just got this delivered and opened it (couldn't wait till Christmas!) You get the reindeer Cry Baby, her pet reindeer, a sled, skis, a Christmas tree, ornaments, and a Santa hat. I think some other goodies too ..like shoes, scarf, and gloves ..I just can't remember them all. Considering all of this for $19.99, you can't beat it. Great set! Even the box is very sturdy and can double as a playset. Definitely buy it for your Cry Babies fan!!

",0.97393083621,toys,"The new LEGO minifigures series has lots of great characters, and a couple who are hit or miss for me. Regardless, any new minifigure is a good thing. After all, even if you don't keep them assembled, their parts can be used to make your own customized figures.I was hoping for the Dog Walker, but I got Bear Costume Guy. He's cute and will probably lead to my LEGO town having a Pride Parade due to his rainbow accessory and coloring. Unless you're willing to pay a lot, these minifigures are sold in bags that provide an element of surprise. It reminds me of opening baseball card packs in the hopes of getting a much-wanted card.Buying these minifigures online removes the option to feel the package in an attempt to guess what figure is inside. However, with toy stores pretty much a thing of the past, there's not that many places in my local area where I can actually buy these. Therefore, I'm very happy that Amazon carries them for a good price.
",0.89578592821,toys,"So at first I was thinking this wouldn't go over as well as a themed blind bags like Harry Potter or Batman, but she loved the one she got, guess it was all about the rubber duckie, yep, she loved it because of the rubber duckie it came with.  Then she started looking at the insert the minifigure came with to see the others in the series and I think it was number 12 with the pink flamingo she was most excited about and wanted the most. Then she freaked out because one figure comes with a chameleon and how cute that was and she loves the one with the two dogs and poop and then she just freaked saying she needed to collect all of them just like Pokemon.  Then she freaked saying they were limited edition and we would have to buy them fast before they were gone.  Now that she has calmed down a little she went back and circled the ones she can't live without on the insert so I would know which ones to get her.  How helpful.  So, there you have it, this new series is a big hit with my 12 year old LEGO fiend and it didn't even need to be about a movie or anything.
",0.80121052322,toys,"My sister just purchased this for my daughter. My daughter loves it but this thing is not worth $70. Very cheaply made. The legs dont even click in place they kinds just sit there. Theres no bench for her to sit on. The cardboard inserts for the doors fall off and have to constantly be put back in place otherwise the doors wont close. The ""mirror"" is more of fun house plastic mirror.  It is cool that it plays a song and has images pop up on the fun house mirror. If I would of purchased this it for sure would be returned because theres way better stuff to spend $70 on for a toddler but since this is a bday present for her I guess well keep it. --- Update --- After having this in our house for a few days now figured I'd give an update. My daughter really really likes this thing. She gets a kick out of the images that display on the fun house mirror along with the song it plays. She has gotten frustrated a couple times now because of the cardboard door inserts that I keep trying to put in place but with no bottom notch to keep them in place they always fall down causing the doors to not be able to close all the way unless you push them back in place or remove them. Just very poorly and cheaply designed. I want to like this thing but the craftsmanship put into molding this thing they definitely cut every corner they could. Still only a 1 star.

",0.97393083624,toys," Super cute! You are divided up into teams. Instead of buying properties, it's most titles like ""Most Fluffiest"" to win game. The tokens are plastic Unicorn and Llama pieces in pastel colors. It's an Amazon exclusive so maybe that's why it's pricier than your average Monopoly board game and why I took away a star. Fun for young and young at heart!
",0.92103803224,toys,"This game makes for a nice change from regular Monopoly with the game being both team-based and focused on territorial control over pure wealth.Players form even teams and go around the board claiming free tiles, stealing them from other players, or locking them down by cementing control. Team members share money and properties. The game ends once all properties have been claimed and one team has the majority.The game itself goes pretty quickly with properties bouncing back and forth and having spaces that take a player to the nearest unclaimed spot. As players share resources, discussing strategy is important as to stop overextension (as running out of money can start a brutal chain reaction). Out first game stayed rather even to the end, with it ending with a score of 9-7, a llama victory.Where the game really fails is organization. The components include character pieces, dice, a property deck, 2 chance decks, a set of control tokens for each team, and some money (in two denominations, $100 and $500). To hold all this, you're given a basic bankers try for the standard monopoly game. This means besides the money, which only needs two of the slots, nothing fits right. And to further top it off, you can't keep it in the tray as the box is too short to allow the cards to remain upright in the slots, forcing a person to either throw everything together (either in the tray or loose in the box) or have a box that is unable to be closed all the way.

",0.98087286926,toys,"The turbo robot is a cool toy. The recommended age is 5+ but I feel age 8+ will be able to fully enjoy it and know how to use all of its features. As the name implies it has a turbo boost switch that makes the toy go faster. The toy can spin and dance in which it rolls back and forth and plays music. You can record and playback messages. On explore mode turbo can avoid obstacles but if it crashes it knows and will respond to the crash by saying ouch. You can teach it 5 phrases. It seems to be pretty durable and looks like it can take a hit. It requires 6 AAA batteries 3 for the remote and 3 for the bot.

",0.527,toys,"Was so excited about this house and for the price we expected it to be perfect! Once it was assembled I noticed how small it was in comparison to last years! The first thing everyone wanted to try was the snowblower... it worked for about 20 seconds then got clogged up and hasn't worked since. We expected the mess it creates, and it does create a mess. But the little snow scoop they included only picks up a few pieces at a time. I thought the house would be better suited to fit the larger OMG dolls but most of the furniture and rooms are too small or just barely fit them. You definitely can't add any other barbies to the mix which was upsetting, as the little ones like to play with them all together. All the lights are beautiful once it's all assembled but be warned not all batteries are included and it takes a lot!

I don't see how it's  supposedly able to shoot 125' when it isn't able enough  to be dead accurate at less than 25' with no wind. If your plan is to shoot at a distance with no idea of where your shot is gonna end up this is for you.  Might as well call it the new Nerf Scud Missile gun, because that's the accuracy it has!
",0.11161303528,toys,"Just got the Nerf Ultra One two days ago. Pros:1. gorgeous gun, really beautiful2.fits my hands well (but I have shorter fingers)3. Front loading4. It won’t accept any other type of ammo. If you try you’ll jam the round and need a long screwdriver to remove it.Cons:1. If you don’t follow the instructions for assembling the feeder drum it may make the gun unusable. The tabs might break or not come undone if you assembled it in the wrong order.1.5 The gun is not full auto, it’s semi-auto.2. The range is less than claimed.(May be due to darts not being lined up in the chamber.)2.5 The motor takes some time to spin up, so getting full range won’t happen if you shoot too quickly.3. You must twist the darts as you load, making sure you line up the dart fins with the groves inside the chamber. The dart will drop in more easily when it’s lined up. The dart will go straighter and farther if you line them up in the chamber.4. Because of the finesse needed to load the rounds you won’t have a fast reload time.5. The drum makes it difficult to hold the front of the gun because it gets in the way. It forces you to bend your elbow. People with longer arms may not find this an issue. Small kids may find it tough.6. The Ammo is easy to lose because it is charcoal in color with an orange tip.6.5 The darts are super light and stubby so the wind will effect them more than standard darts.7. Nerf did not include enough darts to fill the drum or the stock mounted ammo storage. Obviously Nerf couldn’t make enough darts to cover the first run of these guns. Call Hasbro and complain.8. You cannot purchase ammo at this time. Call Hasbro and complain. In fact with Christmas coming there will be a backlog of orders for these new darts and guns. You may have to wait until January or later.9. The patent on these darts may prevent aftermarket/cheaper darts from being produced for months or years.That’s my review of the Nerf Ultra One. Send me questions if you like.
",0.18313682128,toys,"Pros::(Cons:1) Proprietary ammo that only works with this blaster and none others.2) Said ammo is incredibly expensive at 50 cents a piece.3) Said ammo is only slightly better than nerf branded elite darts which are widely known as industry worst.  Most expensive and worst performance.4) Blaster brings nothing new or innovative that isn't already made or made better.  Ergonomics are poor.  Trigger pull is heavy.  Darts are not consistently fired.  A lot of mechanical flop.5) Heavy and expensive C batteries required.6) This line won't last because nobody will buy it.  You will have a one off blaster that In a short time will be obsolete and no replacement ammo.DO NOT BUY THIS
",0.02168133928,toys,"First the blaster itself is pretty nice looking, however, the darts perform nothing like the box claims. And the refill packs are expensive at about 50 cents a dart at the time of this writing. It will not fire your existing nerf brand or any off brand ammo.

",0.86027479228,toys,"The Ultra One is decently reliable, functional, and stylish. Unfortunately that is not enough to justify its $50 price tag or the new darts it brings to the table. While I have not experienced any jams or malfunctions I have found that the trigger pull is not very comfortable over time. The range claims of 120 ft are very unrealistic (closer to 100 ft at an angle) and the accuracy is no better than the tried and true Accustrike darts. Ultra darts ""change everything"" by being awkwardly short, slippery to hold in handfuls, somewhat harder to find than most Nerf darts, and easy to destroy/snap in half.There are many better Nerf blasters that you could purchase this year instead of the Ultra One. Maybe future Ultra blasters will show the potential of this line and drive down dart prices but until then, I cannot recommend this blaster.
",0.0594515228,toys,"The darts perform better than typical Nerf Elite darts by a lot...but the 120 feet is hard to achieve without perfect angling (i.e., it's 120 ft at a 40-45 deg angle).  Most of the darts fly well but you get the occasional dud.  I like it alot.  It's not a $180 pricepoint, so comparing this to specialist hobbyist blasters like DartZone is probably not the right compare.Last, it's a big blaster.  It'd be hard for a 6-yo or younger to maneuver.Taking it all into account, 4-stars seems about right.  I'm excited to see what a spring-powered Ultra will do in the next iterations.

",0.935365229,toys,"****UPDATE****Ok I just realized the tagline for this toy is, ""GET HUGE"" (insert Michael Scott, that's what she said)....maybe you guys should change the tag? LOL seriously. who came up with this?!-but real update, it's been a week & my daughter is still playing with this toy which is shocking.Okay so my daughter isn't a very patient person, but she's 3. I had to do most of the work to get the egg to hatch, but she thought it was so amusing.So when this first arrived, I was shocked as to how big the egg was. It's a lot bigger than the other eggs that you typically see. It took a bit to get the egg to hatch as you need to really pour your love into it (patience and time like 5 minutes of your time). I mean you have to tap, rub and gently shake it. Once the llalacorn (it's a llama + unicorn, cause you know) was ready to hatch (rainbow eyes show), my daughter tried to grab it and smash it (she's done it to the other Hatchimals), so I had to show her how to be gentle with ""baby"".It took about 3 minutes to hatch the egg and get the llalacorn to expose herself to us. We received the pink one, which my daughter loved since it's her favorite color. She loved that you could feed the llalacorn, tickle her and even make her blow up like a balloon (which I thought was hilarious). My daughter loves the fact that llalacorn burps and won't stop making the llalacorn burp. I also love that you can hatch the llalacorn over and over again. She also thinks it makes funny noises which it kind of does (more like a chicken now that I think about this).All in all, my daughter had a lot of fun with her llalacorn. Of course it took a while to really understand the toy and play with it to know all that it could do. The instruction manual helped find new tricks too.
",0.82928866129,toys,"What an entertaining toy!  My 4 year old daughter giggled for a solid hour at the llalacorn’s unpredictability and then even more so when she figured out her simple commands!  My daughter could not believe how tall she got and kept telling her “happy birthday” and “you’re so cute”! She even hugged and kissed her and would laugh when she would grow while mid kiss.  We love our original hatchimal, but the extra fun of this one is that it can re-hatch over and over.  The YouTube tutorial video was super helpful to quickly learn all the commands and features of our new toy, and also learn how to correctly open it.  Would highly recommend!
",0.98299181529,toys,"My granddaughter loves this toy although she did want the purple one but since you’re not able to choose the color luckily getting the pink one wasn’t a big deal.

My 5 year old especially loves to care for and nurture her new pet, and her 2 year old sister loves when it grows to be taller than she is!

",0.08374622530,toys,no review,0.74278234431,toys,"We recently received Owleez in white and my kids (5 & 7) were immediately drawn to its cute appearance and many interactive features. Thankfully it charged pretty quickly using its included USB cable. I love that the cable is attached to the nest so there's no chance of kids losing it. At first it reminded me of one of the ""Fingerling"" toys because of the interaction, nurturing, and noises but the features of the Owleez exceed that of other toys we have tried. The color changing eyes and included instructions make it easy for kids to understand what it wants and my kids particularly enjoyed the color changing game it plays.As for the flight feature, while it is certainly impressive and something we've never seen before, my kids are actually a bit scared of it. They enjoyed ""teaching"" him to fly and wanted to try it several times for him to get better but each time it actually took off, my kids got nervous about how to catch or guide it. My 7 year old said it seemed like a drone. It can also be a little challenging to find a space in your house for it to fly. So far it hasn't crashed into anything except the floor and it is very lightweight but I worry about it hitting the TV or a lamp. The instructions say that it does get better at flying with more practice so maybe we will figure that out more as we continue to play with it.Overall, I think it is a pretty cool little toys best suited for kids 8-10 years old.
",0.94535684631,toys,"Returned after one attempt at flying.  After taking the owl out of its box and fully charging I wanted to test this thing before turning over to my daughter for Christmas.  I struggled to get this it into flying mode and it kept crying.  Finally it was ready, and suddenly I was terrified!  This thing sounded like a real helicopter was about to take off in my house. After spinning up for a few seconds it lifted off and immediately came towards me (not up) and I was sent diving out of the way not to be sliced into bits by the rotors.  Instead it hit the edge of our bed and fell to the floor.  Boxed it up and returned.  I can see many kids heading to the hospital on Christmas Day because of this thing.
",0.531,toys,"Our daughter loved playing with her Owleez. The overall guide to learn how to take care of her owleez was easy enough for our nine-year-old daughter to set it up herself. She Absolutely loved taking care of her owl everyday. The cheat guide as we like to call it was easy to reference to if we didnt know what the owl needed per the owls eye color. As a parent I loved not having to buy batteries as its rechargeable by plug in. My daughter has been video chatting her friends showing them her new owl toy as well as having her best friend over to try it out as well. This owleez was a hit in our house. I do recommend using the flying mode outside as you'll have better luck not flying into something in your house. If you know of a child who enjoys taking care of animals this is a perfect gift for them. I'd highly recommend this as a gift. Even as a parent it reminded me of one of my favorite toys as a child the Furby. My daughter and I enjoyed playing with this toy.
",0.94804775731,toys,"I purchased this for my daughters birthday, she had seen it on TV and wanted it. Kudos to Amazon, even with preorder it arrived the very next day and was an absolute hit! It didnt take long for it to start ""trying"" to fly, it says each time it will try a little longer but she gets so excited when it starts! I also like that the USB plug is built in to the base of its nest, so no losing the charger to it!! Overall I am super pleased with the toy and so is she!
",0.87114596431,toys,"Our girls love playing with their Owleez. While the flying is a big part of the fun they really love petting, rocking, and feeding the little owl even more. The quick start guide with the key for the eye color signals was incredibly helpful for teaching them how to respond to their pink cute owl. My five year old especially loves hearing the bird coo and squeal when she pets or 'feeds' it. They both get extremely excited when they hear the fanfare announcing it's time to fly. Truly an amazing toy.
",0.97614461231,toys,"We got this as a gift and our 2 and 8 year old love it! Taking care of it (feeding, petting, putting to sleep/nap, etc) is the feature that I like about it the best. The sounds it makes that relate to its emotions (crying, singing, etc) is really innovative and make our girls react to its needs, much like a virtual pet. The flying part of the toy is something that isn't something we use often. You do need a lot of room or it bumps (and stops flying) into the walls or furniture. It's very durable so it hasn't broken any propeller blades with all the bumps it has gone through (it cries when it bumps into things). The noise of the spinning blades does make our 2 year old run around the corner or run a good distance away (which is great) to watch. Overall, it's a cute virtual pet with the potential of flying around a bit. Oh! And it DOESN'T need batteries which is fantastic!!! The nest is the owl's charger and the nest its self is charged via USB cord (which is connected to the nest). BRILLIANT!!!
",0.95910280931,toys,"We received this as a gift and It’s a really cool flying toy just be sure to make sure it’s charged all the way before trying it or it won’t fly.It’s very comparable to the hatchimal toys but this one is far better and not annoying.It promotes a nurturing quality and lets children know what it needs by the color changing eyes. It really gets the kids thinking of feelings.It comes with a guide so that the kids can read what each eye color means and how they can help their owl. It also comes with a base for charging and a chord to plug into an outlet. Overall it’s a cute gift.
",0.97843372831,toys,"I received this product as a gift. The toy itself is small (about 4in tall), light and very cute. My daughter loved the interaction with it. It makes noises and the eyes light up with different colors that mean different emotions (sad, happy, hungry, cold etc). She loved taking care of it. As for flying, it only flies when it's in the nest and it needs to be placed on a flat surface. It takes off pretty high so you definitely need a lot of room to have it fly and keep other objects and people away from it. When it hits something while flying, it will fall down and give a sad emotion. The max time it will fly is about 10 seconds. When it's flying, the propeller tends to be too loud so that was probably the only thing we didn't like. The owl is rechargeable so that's a plus. Overall, it's a really fun interactive toy.
",0.09780740731,toys,"We recently received the Owleez as a gift and my daughters (age 5 and 8) absolutely love it.  The directions to fly and nurture were very easy to follow and before we knew it, our Owleez was flying in the air!  It takes off and flies in different directions making it fun to follow around.  The best part is that if it does crash in to something it just falls to the ground, but does not break or become injured.  This toy far surpasses other interactive toys we have had because of the flight option and easy instructions for nurturing and playing with it.  We love the bright pink color and furry wings.  We would highly recommend this interactive toy!
",0.97806966331,toys,"NOT worth the money. This toy was interesting for a day (not a full day) and then my 7 year old lost interest. My twin 3 year olds would want to play with it occasionally but it’s “flying” was hardly exciting since it would go up about a foot and then head straight into the ground. If it was $5 I would be satisfied but it’s not worth a dime more than that.
",0.07183715732,toys,"I am getting a little obsessed with these already. I bought one for each of my kids and my nieces for Christmas. I secretly opened one so I could see what they look like and they are so soft and cute. I love that they each come with a card that tells things about them and there is a collection. I think these will be a big hit. If not, I might keep them all for myself :)
",0.91814422632,toys,"These Cutetitos are soooooo adorable, and one of the best blind bags I have seen. The packaging is so creative! They look like real burritos that you would order at a restaurant. :) My kids just love them, and they are a decent sized toy. My son received one as a gift and unwrapped one of the rare plushies...a sweet orange puppy with little tongue sticking out. He loves to carry his new puppy around in his burrito blanket and have it ""lick"" people. Of course my daughter wanted one as well, so I ordered from Amazon. I was a little nervous because my daughter insisted she wanted to get a rare one too since that is what her brother got, but when her burrito arrived, she was very happy to have one of the common kitty cats. She didn't care that it wasn't a rare one and thought it was just so cute and soft. Both kids sleep with their burrito pets at night, and carry them around during the day. I myself love the fad of the blind bags. It is fun not really knowing what you are going to get, and every character is super sweet looking. The kids are asking for more for their birthdays.
",0.96825349332,toys,"Our 4 year old daughter had to have this for her birthday after watching a commercial. It’s a cute idea but as soon as she opened it she got upset because she wanted the pink dog she saw on the commercial. It’s probably a genius idea because parents are pressured to buy more and more until their kids get the one they wanted. Obviously there is no guarantee you won’t get one you already have. My daughter did end up liking the one she got but I have a feeling she will continue to ask for more.
",0.16783526532,toys,"My daughter was so excited when she opened this on her birthday especially because she got an ultra-rare Cutetito.  I will definitely purchase one for her this Christmas.  These toys are really cute.

Extremely unique, I'm sure these will be a hit for children and families.  (All ages) i may even get myself one. Like the idea that they are collectables. How fun!!!

It is wrapped as a little burrito and is soft and well played with. It was better construction than I was expecting.My wife hates it because the mystery of not knowing means you can't know if you are just getting a duplicate or not.

You cant tell which one you're going to get until you unwrap your burrito blanket off the stuffed animal. The animal is about 6 ish inches long, durable cotton type material and its rear end is stuffed with beads of some sort.These were her rewards for bringing home A's on her report card for 6 weeks of intense spelling words, common core math (which isnt easy) and numerous other subjects. They were very well priced and as always packaged well and arrived right on time!
",0.81849288932,toys,"It was cute. Did I feel like it was worth $10? Not really. I'm kind of disappointed that we got the puppy. I was hoping for one of the random ones or something a little cuter. My daughter does like it though. She also likes to take the tortilla and try to make our real dog into a burrito... it doesn't work out very well. Lol.
",0.8063504733,toys,"The characters are cute but Very Cheaply Made and definitely not worth $24.99.  I bought these characters to go in my granddaughter's doll house.  She is obsessed with the Frozen characters!  She is 3 1/2 years old but is meticulously careful with her toys.  Within the first 30 minutes of playing with them, Elisa's head fell off then Anna's head fell off.  The heads are only snapped on - poor design!  Because the heads could easily be lost.  They can sit by bending at the waist but not until their capes are removed.  Elisa's cape is very stiff so it is easier to remove than Anna's  cape which is made of soft plastic.  One has to pull down on the soft plastic to get it off of Anna's arm.  It is only a matter of time before the soft plastic rips (so now we will have two dolls with no heads and Anna will not have her cape!) The makers certainly were not thinking that these cute little dolls were going to be played with!!  Kristoff, Sevn, and Gale seem to appear to be OK for now!  I can not return this item because my granddaughter started to cry and say that she would be careful not to loose Elisa and Anna's heads.  I gave this item two stars because the characters are cute and my granddaughter is in love with the characters with or without their heads.  I took away three of the stars because as a consumer I feel taken by the manufacture, upset with the POOR quality, and the cost I actually paid for something that probably be thrown out.

",0.25306701734,toys,"My daughter, age five, has gone absolutely nuts over this thing. She likes it so much I'm going to have to buy her sister one. We love Little Live Pets in our house, the kids favorite being the bird in the cage, and yes we have two of those as well. I was super curious as to how this works so here's what I figured out.When you pull the tab on the top of the box it frees the handle to pull the the cardboard piece in the animal out in one swoop. By doing this it pulls out the clear plastic tab attached to the bottom the box. This is what starts your little matted lump to shiver. Ours was blue and it is truly a matted down mess. You can feel the wires underneath and it looks like it almost has some kind of very thin netting that helps keep it matted down over the top of it.I filled one side of our sink with really warm water and let her dunk it in. With a little rubbing it immediately starts to loosen up and I found that a little Johnson's baby soap helps soften it up and clean it up. The instructions say to rince really well and we did. As you put it in the warm water it stop shivering and makes appreciative noises. We had a doggy! It has glittery pink ears and is actually pretty cute.When reading the instructions it says that you can put it in the spin cycle in the washer to make it dry faster but you have to remove the electronics. It didn't seem too involved but my daughter wanted to dry it herself so we used a hair dryer on low and then let it sit for a while. After a few hours she decided to brush it out. It comes with a thin little comb that works but she found a larger brush from another toy and that seem to do a little better job. It seems to need a little more than a comb.I can still feel the wires that hold the electronics in place but overall it's fluffed up pretty nicely. She could care less as she loves this thing. It hiccups and burps, coos and drinks from a bottle. It even cries when it's not had enough to eat. You can pet it on its head and make noises and it actually falls asleep. The most wonderful thing is that it has a button to turn it off. It's an electronic toy, it makes noise, but I don't find it really loud. The question now remains, how hard is it to get the kitty? That is what my other child wants. Overall, it's a cute toy and seems to keep her entertained. We have a get a new toy give away a toy policy and I think this will be one she keeps around for a while. By the way, it comes with a collar, a baby bottle, a comb and an adoption certificate. She's named hers Lilly Blue.

My daughter was so in to saving her kitty. It does make lots of different noises. And she can feed it and it hiccups! Which she loves. I really like that we could have a conversation about saving animals after. Instills a valuable lesson.The reason I took a star off:-Even after bathing it is pretty mangy.-the sounds are harder to get to work the more she plays with it. So I’m guessing the battery is going out. So the battery doesn’t last super long in it.
",0.86093938434,toys,"We are a scruff a luvs family.  All of my children, nieces and nephews received one for Christmas, and at October, I assure you they are the only toy the kids got that is still being played with.The latest addition to the scruff a luv family is an electronic version.  Brilliant and not a little bit scary considering the whole electric and water don't mix thing.  This version is much larger than the normal one, and has the added bonus of ""shivering"" to help prompt you to wash it and clean it up.  You do the usual bathe them, squeeze them out, towel dry, shake and hair dry, brush to turn that matted ball of fur into a stuffed animal.  Make sure to wash them well (we use baby shampoo) or it will be sticky of have matted spots once dry.  This one comes with a collar and id tag, bottle, comb and adoption certificate.Once you put batteries in the back of the head (2 x AA) the scruff a luv will come to life with 35 different motions and sounds.  They will bark or meow, need to be fed, hiccup, burp, etc.  The best part?  No poop.  The noises are set in that magical frequency that adults find annoying but children find endearing, so you are warned.I suspect this will be a hot toy this Christmas . . . as are most things surprise, electric and/or stuffed.  They certainly will be in our house.

",0.83042937535,toys,"My son loves this game. We play for hours. Fun for adults to.
",0.94755065435,toys,"We've only had this a few days so far, but my kids love it so far! They and their neighborhood friends were playing almost non-stop this entire weekend. It's a pretty unique concept and not at all what I expected coming from the original battleship: Rather than the game of strategy (and sometimes just luck!) that the traditional battleship is, this is mostly a game of skill. There is still some strategy in how you align your boats, but rather than try to determine where the other player's position is, you can see their board and have to toss one of the included ping-pong balls into the holes. Land a ball in all the boat's places, and you've sunk their ship! It is definitely reminiscent of beer pong in skillset, or perhaps one of those arcade games that require you to land a ball in a colored cup. You definitely need more space to play since there will be balls bouncing around if/when you miss, but it is a lot of fun. A creative twist on a classic game!One thing that is a little strange to me however, is the advertising. The listing for this product says ""Nostalgic tabletop gameplay meets interactive digital content for an immersive gaming experience"".  There's nothing digital about this, let alone interactive digital and immersive. It's a pretty fun analog pick-up-and-play game, which is what I like about it actually, but it was hard to determine what we were getting before we tried it.
",0.84063255835,toys,"This is literally beer pong for children. Kids growing up on this game will be legends later in their social lives. Joking aside this game is really fun and the kids and adults enjoyed playing it. Not quite the battleship I remember in any way other than the visual theme. This is a hit among our group.
",0.91353917135,toys,"This is a unique take on the classic battleship game. The game comes ready to play in minutes after unboxing. The core concepts remains the same. Simply sync the opponents ships. But rather than guessing numbers and putting little pegs on a board, it becomes a firing frenzy of little bouncy balls. While they can fly around, they do not have a terribly long range so the mess from the game stays relatively contained. There are about a dozen balls with the game making it relatively easy to account for all of the pieces after you’re done. It’s certainly been an entertaining game for the little ones around the house. It is even been an entertaining game for the adults after a few other types of shots of their own.
",0.84877884435,toys,"Such a creative idea to change up the old battleship game. I haven't played the older version since I was a kid but I remember playing it fondly. Now you and kids can with what are essentially ping pong balls and bounce them over to make them into differently shaped ships. I like that everything fits inside of an easy to carry and store brief case. It's cute, light weight, and provides hours of fun! No devices or batteries required. ;)
",0.88385039635,toys,"This looks like a game that most kids would like to play. I found that the case was hard for me to open the latches but that could just be my hands that have arthritis. At first, I couldn't find the scene that was shown in the pictures and then I finally found it. It is a clear plastic piece with a battleship printed on it. At first, it seemed hard to open out the playing pieces that hold the battleships, but that is because once the orange case is opened, the blue 'water' needs to be pulled up and once it gets to the right point it will lay down flat for each player. The game is for 2 people age 8+. Some of the younger players may have initial trouble setting up the game if they have some delayed motor skills, but once they know how to set it up, shouldn't have continued trouble. I think most children and enthusiastic adults will enjoy this game.This game would make a great gift. Thank you for allowing me to review this game.
",0.23746886835,toys,"This is fun.  I do feel like the instructions could have been better.  It suggests bouncing the ball over the wall but it usually bounces too far.  It also says that you can just toss it over the barrier which makes it too easy.  It is a great idea.  My 4 year old and I had fun playing it but my 6 and 8 year old got bored with it quickly.
",0.90973591835,toys,"My kids and I have a blast playing this game. It is simpler and faster than the regular Battleship game, but my kids are young so this works perfectly for them. My seven year old can easily put this together and get it ready to play. It comes with 14 orange balls and 1 red ball and the object of the game is to throw of bounce the balls into the battleships. We don't really play the red ball rule but I think it goes something along the lines of after you get a ball in a battleship you can use the red ball and if you get it in the yellow battleship you win the game. We just throw the balls continuously until one of us completely fills up the other persons battleships. It is a lot of fun and those balls go everywhere. The kids love it and want to play over and over.

",0.99998164237,toys,"I got this for myself, as I am an adult nerd, who loves star wars, legos and spaceships, but I don't feel like I can afford to spend lots of money on larger lego sets.This kit is great though.  If you're looking for a lego spaceship to woosh around the room, it's a good fit for anyone short of small children (contrasting to larger lego spaceships that are too big, or sometimes a little too fragile to enthusiastically ""fly"" them around the house).  If you're looking for a nerdly room decoration, it's a fine looking A-Wing, well proportioned to the ship as it appears in movies.As a toy it has some cool features too.  The folding landing gear looks neat compared to how the older A-Wings that sat on their tail fins.  The spring loaded missiles are a neat addition, and the launch buttons well hidden on the finished model (like you know where the buttons are, but they're not like a massive obvious tab).  You can point the guns on the sides of the ship up and down like the ""real"" A-Wing too.The minifigs are neat.  The pilot's helmet even has a little transparent bit that matches the visor on pilot's helmets in the movies.  The non-pilot figure is a nice addition, she mixes well with some of the other rebel/resistance soldiers I have on my ""shelf of nerd things""So in a nutshell it's a very nice A-Wing lego set for a whole 26 dollars.  While it's smaller and less parts than some of the other Star Wars Lego sets, it feels like you get way more ""ship"" for your money than other choices.  Highly recommended.

One correction, and putting the engines one, which took me too for a loop for a minute or so.Overall I like this unit, it has two auto canons, which are triggered by pushing buttons on the top of the A-Wing. Really well designed from that perspective. Also, the unit is very sturdy with not much hanging/dangling or making it unstable for a little rougher play by a 5-year old.Definitely a good buy.

",0.2341187637,toys,"My 7-year old put this together in about an hour and enjoyed every moment of it.  The instructions are a critical part of these sets and Lego never fails to impress with simplicity and legibility.  Every time I hand a Lego set to one of my kids I'm confident the box contains everything needed for a child to correctly assemble the set.  (This cannot be said of knock-off brands like Megaconstrux, as I've recently learned.)My son's favorite aspect of the completed speeder was the minor articulation of the jet/foil assemblies at the back (they tilt up and down slightly).  Little nuances like that really enhance imaginative play.As of the writing of this review, the movie this toy is from is still a couple of months from being released and I have no idea who the characters are who are included - meaning they're either so minor that I never learned their names, or that they're going to be introduced in the upcoming film, but it hardly matters as the Star Wars universe is so rife with imaginary vehicles and great well considered designs that it would look great and be fun to play with even without attachment to an epic movie series.One of my favorite things about Lego, aside from the near endless platform for imaginative building, is the dexterity it fosters in children.  I've watched my kids grow more and more skilled over the years putting together larger and larger kits, and I'm confident that Lego has has a real impact in that aspect of their development.
",0.91562378437,toys,"Very nice little set based on the new movie coming out December 2019. The set comes with a male and female character from the movie (Snap Wexley and Lieutenant Connix)  and they each have blaster weapons. The ship's cockpit opens and you can put the pilot inside. other cool features are the landing gear that comes down and the little laser beam weapons that you can shoot. The ship has the resistance logo on the front and matches the color scheme of the ship from the movie.I'm not sure if this is a collectors edition thing, it was shipped to me in a paper bubble package and the box was all smashed up which would make it worthless to collect. Fortunately my plan was to build it so I don't care about the box being in perfect condition. I usually don't comment on packaging but in this case it may be an issue for a serious collector that wants a perfect box and doesn't intend to build the kit.I have a few other Star Wars lego kits and while they are all from different movies, they sort of fit together and I have them on display on a shelf as a little scene that never happened from the Star Wars universe. Nice kit overall, no pieces missing, easy to put together, and kind of a fun way to get hyped for the new movie which comes out in about 2 months from the time of this review. Hopefully it's good.

",0.78112304238,toys,"This game is beautiful and so much fun to play. We have been counting down the days for its arrival since we played it at a friend's house a couple months ago (then INSISTED that we be invited back to play again). It's one of those games where, even when you lose, the concept and execution is so wonderful that you enjoy playing. If you can snag this for the retail price, _run_ don't walk to get this.The game is not super simple, so if you're playing with the young/inexperienced/daft, this may be difficult at first for them to pick up. But the theming is so gorgeous that I think it will appeal to people who aren't traditional board game geeks. It's also not so complicated that it will take two hours to set up and explain, like some games.The game is not vicious - on the margin, you can harm another player intentionally. But, for the most part, you're doing your own thing on your own board. That's good if you're playing with sensitive types. There's also a decent amount of luck, with the card drawing. I like luck, because it means that new players can win.Other game makers - please make games this beautiful in other genres!! I want more like Wingspan. If you know of other games like this, reply in the comments to this post. Thanks!
",0.96909558838,toys,"1-5 players, Competitive, Engine Building Bird ParadiseOverview of Gameplay-In Wingspan you need to build a build empire. However there are many different ways to build said empire. You could place high value birds on your player mat to gather points or you could place low valued birds that have better synergies with other birds. There are eggs you can lay on your birds that are worth points or some of your birds can gather food up or even devour other birds. In short there are a lot of ways to gain points in this game and finding that perfect strategy may not be as easy as it sounds….So to play the game is actually really simple. On your turn you place one of your colored wooden cubes on a specific spot on your player board and take the action that is there. The actions are: Play a bird, Gain food, Lay eggs and draw card. That’s it. The key is to play in such a method that the bird madness you create on your board all works together fluidly. Because as you start playing birds on your board, depending on what row you play them in, those actions become more powerful. So let’s say you have a couple birds already played to the forest row, well now when you perform the “Gain Food” action you can gain two food instead of the one food like everyone starts with.What makes it more tactical though is that you are constrained by your starting birds. At the very beginning each player is dealt 5 random bird cards and 1 of each of the 5 food tokens and you can keep however many of those cards you want at the cost of 1 food each. Not only that but each player is dealt 2 objective cards and has to choose just one to keep. So right off the bat you have to make a choice on how you want to proceed building your bird engine based on what you have in hand. It’s an interesting choice for sure, and for the life of me every game I’ve played it hasn’t been about winning. It’s always been about something super specific that a particular person had on their mind. A couple examples, my wife played and in her starting hand was this Horned Owl that looks all devious. Now she loves owls so I can only imagine the glee in her bones when she had this card. The ONLY thing in her mind was that she HAD to play this card regardless of the cost. Now I believe the cost on that particular Owl was 3 rats. Of the 5 different foods that can be gained rats are are one of the most rare. Also there are precious few birds in the large deck that eat rats so you don’t see them come up all that often compared to the others. So she spent a very large portion of the game trying to gather up enough rats to play this beast. She finally did and she was pleased, however it cost her the game. But that didn’t matter at that moment, she accomplished her goal that she created from the get go.In another instance I was playing a 5 player game with some friends and one of my buddies got it in his mind that he wanted to find the Pigeon card in the deck. So he built this incredible “Draw Card” bird engine that when combined with bird cards that he played had him drawing up 11 bird cards every turn. At the end of the game he came in 4th on points and never did find that pigeon (there isn’t one in the game) but the amount of fun he had hunting was glorious. That game in particular also showed me so many different ways you can build up your bird engine and was an interesting experiment on different strategies. In any case I’ve dolled on long enough, onward with the review!Components/Game board –This is one of those games that goes far above and beyond when it comes to component quality. Before I purchased the game for myself I had played a friends copy and got the honor of touching his rulebook. My gawd. These rulebooks are heavenly. The pages feel like…like…what you imagine a cloud must feel like when you were six years old. The softness and texture is out of this world. The cards also have a lovely texture to them, the oversized wooden dice have custom images emblazoned on the sides and roll perfectly down a custom made bird house dice tower that also feel very sturdy. There is a plastic storage holder that doubles as the card draw for the cards that has an image of a bird on it. I mean the ONLY things in the game that I would even consider average are the wooden action cubes and the cardboard food tokens and even those look very nice on the table. Oh and the plastic eggs! A whole fat batch of plastic eggs that you use in the game that adds an immense amount of theme.The player boards are also super high quality. They fold in half and have a kind of soft smooth textured touch to them. It’s hard to put into words until you feel of them yourself…..especially those rulebooks. Anyway as far as components go this game shot straight to the top for me. Super high quality and attention to detail with every aspect.Box/Storage –The box also has a nice feel to it as well, it just feels premium. And it’s not all that big either when compared to most modern games. I would say a little smaller than average. And even though it doesn’t come with a proper insert, everything fits in the box almost perfectly. Now this is the way to measure and pack a game box. There is even a diagram on the inside lip of the box that shows you how to pack the box. There are a few plastic containers that allow you to store the tokens though which is nice. The big storage aspect though is the plastic card holder. This baby stores all the cards and has a nice lid to keep them all nice and organized. Beyond all that though you will bag up the rest of the stuff such as the eggs and dice. For a game without a full insert I was pleasantly surprised at how well everything came together in the box.Visual Appeal /Theme–Another aspect that they just knocked out of the park with this game. The game is gorgeous with a variety of colors all over the player boards. And not just the player boards either, the plastic eggs are all colored differently as well as the food tokens and player action cubes. Visually this game just draws people in when they get a glimpse of it, it stands out. Now I remember when this game was first announced, the theme was to me, uninteresting. I remember thinking, “birds? Meh”. Oh how wrong I was to dismiss this game just because of the theme. After having played it I can say the way the bird theme integrates with the game mechanics and how interesting it is to see some birds synergizing with others is just awesome. Strictly speaking just because of this game, I will never judge a game solely on its theme alone again.In any case they did an outstanding job with the bird cards. Heck even if you are not a bird lover, the little bits of bird knowledge on each card is fun to read! Plus some of the bird names are just hilarious. It never fails to bring a smile from the groups I play with when I flip a new bird card and read its name aloud along with the nice little bird fact.Rulebook –Oh don’t even get me started rn. These 3 rulebooks included with this game are…..unbelievable. And in such an amazing way. I mean honestly I am at this moment having a hard time even remembering the rules…..it’s almost like once I touch the softness of the pages my mind is whisked away to an enchanted forest where only the softest of trees grow and tiniest fuzzballs of birds dwell. Snapping back into existence, the rules are written out easy to read with plenty of examples and even still there really isn’t much to explain as the game is so straight forward as it is. But I don’t recall ever wondering about a specific rule and I haven’t had to come to the forums in search of a rules question which is always a good sign.I mentioned 3 rulebooks up there ^. There is the regular book to explain the game, an appendix book that goes over all the finer details (which I have never needed to use) and a solo Automa rulebook which explains how to play the solo game. The solo game is super fun and unique and I’ll delve into that more in the player count section below. All in all though the rulebook/s are great!Table Talk/Fun Factor –The game is played on your own personal player board as there is no group board to play upon so you do find yourself focusing on your own devices a lot more than worrying about others. That said, at least with the groups I play with, we always seem to keep conversation going about the game while we play. We are always talking about the different birds we find and I typically handle the draw pile for everyone around the table and read aloud the new birds with their little tidbit of intriguing info. It goes a long way to keeping everyone engaged and not only that but people always seem interested in strategies that everyone else is doing.I always ask my groups how they like the games we play every week and every single person enjoyed this one. They all said the same thing too, they loved all the different ways you could try to win by gaining points.Optimal Player Count/Replayability –I think this game wins in a number of different player counts. Solo is a blast as the game comes with a dedicated automa solo mode complete with its own cards and instructions. I enjoyed all my plays solo and am itching to play it as we speak. 2-5 player is super fun as well however I did see some downtime during the 5 player games I played. The downtime wasn’t nearly as bad as some games I’ve played in the past but it’s something to be aware of.Replayability is pretty good for the most part. There are 150-ish different bird cards in that large deck so more than likely you will not see ALL the birds for quite some time. So each new game you play you can try out new strategies depending on what birds you collect/draw. That said it’s the same game mechanics over and over of playing birds, collecting food, drawing cards, laying eggs. The variety comes from HOW you choose to build your engine.Positive Final Thoughts –If you are looking for a great engine building style of game with loads of theme and color then look no further. Even if you are not a fan of birds in general the gameplay mechanics are a hoot. With the amount of variety of the different birds and ways you can try to win this game will keep you occupied for a very good long time. Not only that but the component quality is off the charts, and for the love of relish you NEED to feel these rulebooks omg.Negative Final Thoughts –I wish there was a pigeon. Also the game isn’t crazy deep so if you are looking for a complex strategy game or a brain burner then this isn’t it. There are card synergies you can play but that’s about as deep as this game gets. Also the end game seems a little lopsided, what I mean is that it seems like everyone always leans towards laying eggs for those easy points during the 4th and last round. Since there isn’t as much time to play actions during the last round due to having only 5 action cubes (when compared to 8 in the first round as you lose 1 action cube each round) players seem to all agree that laying eggs during the last round is the best course of action.
",0.94017744138,toys,"Our family plays a lot of Eurogames, and Wingspan ranks up there with the best of them!  The build quality is stunning - dice roller, plenty of bags and boxes to hold everything (no need for special wooden organizers really), pieces, and even the quality of the paper stock used in the rules is head and shoulders above typical fare.There is surprising depth for a game about birds, with multiple possible ways to win.  Once you do a few turns the game pace is pretty steady.Overall highly recommended and probably the best game of this sort since Gloomhaven, and it appeals to a wider audience.  Great add to any collection and worth every penny.
",0.96326947238,toys,"The artwork for this game is phenomenal. (You can actually order prints via a link provided on the info page of the game on StoneMaier's website). The components are all high quality. I would have preferred for the game to come with wooden resource tokens, but if you desire, those can be acquired through MeepleSource. I thoroughly enjoy Gizmos and other engine building games and this is a great one. I like how you can decide if you want round scoring to be directly competitive or indirectly competitive. If you are looking for a multiplayer game that can also be played solo, this game has an ""Automa"" designed for the game.The game comes with small token trays to contain pieces. I was not expecting this and was a nice touch. Nothing fancy, just super useful.At first I thought the theme would not appeal to me, but my mind was quickly changed after diving into it. You can tell  how much time was put into the research of each bird on the 170 bird cards.Anyways, I will have to play more games of this before giving a proper critique. But initially I find this game beautiful and charming, with a great use of engine-building mechanics and an abundance of quality components.My ""belongs in my gaming library"" score at this time is a:  5 out of 5 Bird Eggs
",0.98913109338,toys,"Beautiful art, fresh theme, great game.
",0.98102241838,toys,"Beautiful game! It has high quality components, wooden eggs in different colors, slightly oversized wooden dice, and more! This is a wonderful game, even for people who aren't really into board games. It is light on strategy, but very creative and fun!  Overview of gameplay: each player is establishing their own bird sanctuary, trying to attract a variety of birds to move in and lay eggs by providing them with their desired food. The game is played over the course of 4 rounds, each with their own bonus goals. In each round, each player has a set number of actions they can perform by doing  one of 4 options (Play a Bird, Gather Food, Lay Eggs, or Draw Cards). As you play a bird, you will improve the efficiency or power of another action based on where you place your bird in your habitat. Over the course of your game, your Food/Egg/Card Draw engine will improve, making each action you take more satisfying and powerful. The game ends after all players have used all of their actions in Round 4.  We have only played this game with 2 players so far, and it is very satisfying. With 2 people, it takes about 45 minutes to play the game (will take longer with more players). I highly recommend this game! Please mark if you find my review helpful. Thank you so much!
",0.96862721438,toys,"The first time I played Wingspan, with a group of serious gamers, I wasn't sure I liked the game as much as the critical reviews told me I should. Every bird collected into your ""aviary"" comes with a power that changes the dynamic of your strategy; and, I felt that a lucky player could tilt the game early on by collecting a few particular birds.  It comes down, sometime, to the luck of the food dice available to you and, subsequently, that luck follows over into determining what birds you can play based on the food you have on hand.  But, the game is beautiful to look at and looks great on the table; so, I bought my own copy despite my initial reservations.  When I got my copy, I played its solitaire version a dozen or so times.  That's when the game won me over.  No pun intended, but the game did win more often than not.  But, the point is, as I played over and over and came to know the 170 unique bird cards, I began to appreciate how balanced the game is.  I just hadn't appreciated my strategic possibilities in that first play.  I do now.  I have since introduced the game to a group of more casual gamers; and, in a very tight game, a first-timer took a well-earned victory.  On first play, these gamers (a family of friends) found the game so enjoyable, they are now seeking a copy of their own . . . . not an easy thing to find.  My advice:  if you see this game in stock anywhere (Amazon, CoolStuffInc.com, Miniature Market), grab it.  The first play or two might have you scratching your head; but, it will take flight.
",0.96445399538,toys,"This game is so fun. It took a bit longer than usual to understand but after a YouTube demo we got it down and my wife and I both had a blast.

",0.9811623139,toys,"Preordered this about a month ago and we got it today. It’s an advent calendar but we opened it like any normal lego set. My 6 year old daughter loves it and so do I.I attached a picture with 4 pictures, 3 are my own set and then 1 is the stock picture. What you see in the stock picture is EVERYTHING you get. There isn’t anything missing from that picture. Of course you will get extra pieces just like a normal lego set just in case you lose something. (You can see the “extras” off to the side of my 3rd picture of everything built). The build instructions are on the inside flap of the square you open.Even though we opened it all at once, we took turns and the anticipation for the minifigures was REAL for my 6 y/o hah.... so a heads up for parents:The characters are in squares: 1 (Harry), 6 (McGonagall), 10 (Ron), 14 (Hermione) , 18 (Flitwick), 23 (Dumbledore).Also a fun snowman in square 15. Gold statue minifigure in square 21.
",0.539,toys,"I'm torn on the Harry Potter Lego Advent calendar. I was looking forward to it. Yet while there are some interesting and unusual pieces, too much of it is very similar to what we already got in the Great Hall set---tables and benches, a fireplace, variations on House banners, and I'm particularly frustrated by repeat of the McGonagall and Dumbledore figures. After all, the Great Hall is such an essential part of the new series of Harry Potter Legos. I'd think that most people who are willing to spend $40 on an HP Advent calendar would have already bought the Great Hall. So it feels like there are a bunch of missed opportunities where Lego could have made more interesting selections for the Advent calendar.It is interesting to think about how the calendar items could have been better, while still keeping with the HP year one theme to the set. For example, instead of repeating McGonangall, why not make a new Mrs. Weasley? I assume Lego will eventually release more Weasley family members in future sets, but it would be nice to have a new Mrs. Weasley in the meantime. And given that she made the personalized sweaters that were a special part of Harry's first Christmas at Hogwarts, it would have been particularly apt to have her included in this Advent calendar.Instead of another dining table, it would have been better if Lego had included Harry's invisibility cloak as an Advent calendar item, since Harry received it on Christmas.Likewise, I would have preferred if Lego included Filch instead of Flitwick for this Advent calendar. After all, Filch shows up when Harry uses the cloak to explore restricted section of the library. And the Filch Lego figure is harder to come by than Flitwick, since it is in the Whomping Willow set which is fairly pricey but far less essential than the Great Hall set.And why couldn't Lego have done something new with the Dumbledore figure? Maybe dress him as Santa (since the year one Dumbledore already looks a lot like Santa), or at least add his tall wizard hat.Of course, it is easy to suggest alternatives in hindsight. Don't let my comments cause you to lose sight of various charming parts of the new HP Advent calendar. I just hope that Lego includes more unusual pieces when they make the next HP Advent calendar.

Here’s the thing: I ordered two and they arrived looking like any LEGO sets- pictures of the assembled toys on the outside of the box- or why I thought was the outside of the box. But when I examined them closer I realized that the box IS the calendar and the pictures on the back and sides of the box utterly ruin the surprise and anticipation of opening one square a day!

",0.76124304542,toys,"We recently received Owleez in white and my kids (5 & 7) were immediately drawn to its cute appearance and many interactive features. Thankfully it charged pretty quickly using its included USB cable. I love that the cable is attached to the nest so there's no chance of kids losing it. At first it reminded me of one of the ""Fingerling"" toys because of the interaction, nurturing, and noises but the features of the Owleez exceed that of other toys we have tried. The color changing eyes and included instructions make it easy for kids to understand what it wants and my kids particularly enjoyed the color changing game it plays.As for the flight feature, while it is certainly impressive and something we've never seen before, my kids are actually a bit scared of it. They enjoyed ""teaching"" him to fly and wanted to try it several times for him to get better but each time it actually took off, my kids got nervous about how to catch or guide it. My 7 year old said it seemed like a drone. It can also be a little challenging to find a space in your house for it to fly. So far it hasn't crashed into anything except the floor and it is very lightweight but I worry about it hitting the TV or a lamp. The instructions say that it does get better at flying with more practice so maybe we will figure that out more as we continue to play with it.Overall, I think it is a pretty cool little toys best suited for kids 8-10 years old.
",0.94535684642,toys,"Returned after one attempt at flying.  After taking the owl out of its box and fully charging I wanted to test this thing before turning over to my daughter for Christmas.  I struggled to get this it into flying mode and it kept crying.  Finally it was ready, and suddenly I was terrified!  This thing sounded like a real helicopter was about to take off in my house. After spinning up for a few seconds it lifted off and immediately came towards me (not up) and I was sent diving out of the way not to be sliced into bits by the rotors.  Instead it hit the edge of our bed and fell to the floor.  Boxed it up and returned.  I can see many kids heading to the hospital on Christmas Day because of this thing.
",0.542,toys,"Our daughter loved playing with her Owleez. The overall guide to learn how to take care of her owleez was easy enough for our nine-year-old daughter to set it up herself. She Absolutely loved taking care of her owl everyday. The cheat guide as we like to call it was easy to reference to if we didnt know what the owl needed per the owls eye color. As a parent I loved not having to buy batteries as its rechargeable by plug in. My daughter has been video chatting her friends showing them her new owl toy as well as having her best friend over to try it out as well. This owleez was a hit in our house. I do recommend using the flying mode outside as you'll have better luck not flying into something in your house. If you know of a child who enjoys taking care of animals this is a perfect gift for them. I'd highly recommend this as a gift. Even as a parent it reminded me of one of my favorite toys as a child the Furby. My daughter and I enjoyed playing with this toy.
",0.94804775742,toys,"I purchased this for my daughters birthday, she had seen it on TV and wanted it. Kudos to Amazon, even with preorder it arrived the very next day and was an absolute hit! It didnt take long for it to start ""trying"" to fly, it says each time it will try a little longer but she gets so excited when it starts! I also like that the USB plug is built in to the base of its nest, so no losing the charger to it!! Overall I am super pleased with the toy and so is she!
",0.87114596442,toys,"Our girls love playing with their Owleez. While the flying is a big part of the fun they really love petting, rocking, and feeding the little owl even more. The quick start guide with the key for the eye color signals was incredibly helpful for teaching them how to respond to their pink cute owl. My five year old especially loves hearing the bird coo and squeal when she pets or 'feeds' it. They both get extremely excited when they hear the fanfare announcing it's time to fly. Truly an amazing toy.
",0.97614461242,toys,"We got this as a gift and our 2 and 8 year old love it! Taking care of it (feeding, petting, putting to sleep/nap, etc) is the feature that I like about it the best. The sounds it makes that relate to its emotions (crying, singing, etc) is really innovative and make our girls react to its needs, much like a virtual pet. The flying part of the toy is something that isn't something we use often. You do need a lot of room or it bumps (and stops flying) into the walls or furniture. It's very durable so it hasn't broken any propeller blades with all the bumps it has gone through (it cries when it bumps into things). The noise of the spinning blades does make our 2 year old run around the corner or run a good distance away (which is great) to watch. Overall, it's a cute virtual pet with the potential of flying around a bit. Oh! And it DOESN'T need batteries which is fantastic!!! The nest is the owl's charger and the nest its self is charged via USB cord (which is connected to the nest). BRILLIANT!!!
",0.95910280942,toys,"We received this as a gift and It’s a really cool flying toy just be sure to make sure it’s charged all the way before trying it or it won’t fly.It’s very comparable to the hatchimal toys but this one is far better and not annoying.It promotes a nurturing quality and lets children know what it needs by the color changing eyes. It really gets the kids thinking of feelings.It comes with a guide so that the kids can read what each eye color means and how they can help their owl. It also comes with a base for charging and a chord to plug into an outlet. Overall it’s a cute gift.
",0.97843372842,toys,"I received this product as a gift. The toy itself is small (about 4in tall), light and very cute. My daughter loved the interaction with it. It makes noises and the eyes light up with different colors that mean different emotions (sad, happy, hungry, cold etc). She loved taking care of it. As for flying, it only flies when it's in the nest and it needs to be placed on a flat surface. It takes off pretty high so you definitely need a lot of room to have it fly and keep other objects and people away from it. When it hits something while flying, it will fall down and give a sad emotion. The max time it will fly is about 10 seconds. When it's flying, the propeller tends to be too loud so that was probably the only thing we didn't like. The owl is rechargeable so that's a plus. Overall, it's a really fun interactive toy.
",0.09780740742,toys,"We recently received the Owleez as a gift and my daughters (age 5 and 8) absolutely love it.  The directions to fly and nurture were very easy to follow and before we knew it, our Owleez was flying in the air!  It takes off and flies in different directions making it fun to follow around.  The best part is that if it does crash in to something it just falls to the ground, but does not break or become injured.  This toy far surpasses other interactive toys we have had because of the flight option and easy instructions for nurturing and playing with it.  We love the bright pink color and furry wings.  We would highly recommend this interactive toy!
",0.97806966342,toys,"NOT worth the money. This toy was interesting for a day (not a full day) and then my 7 year old lost interest. My twin 3 year olds would want to play with it occasionally but it’s “flying” was hardly exciting since it would go up about a foot and then head straight into the ground. If it was $5 I would be satisfied but it’s not worth a dime more than that.

It's much bigger than I realized. There are buttons and knobs that make things pop-up and spin and play magical, musical sounds. If you turn knob by the stairs they expand outward as the last verse of ""Let It Go"" plays. It's well worth the money and I definitely recommend it. My only complaint is that didn't come out with this sooner!
",0.86680579244,toys,"Significantly less on Amazon than at the retail store i originally saw it at....Hard,  ABS-like plastic construction looks like it will last a while....arrived ready for use, no extrabatteries needed...provides hours of entertainment for my little one.I recommend purchasing the matching sleigh (also on Amazon).
",0.81384921144,toys,"Purchased as a Christmas gift so it's still in the packaging but from first impressions seems like a fun toy for any frozen lover. The shipping however could have been better, the box was slightly bent almost as if to fit in the box that it was shipped in. It's not too severe but it is noticeable. The stairs that come out seem a bit loose. Even without turning the knob the go inward and out so I'm a little worried that when playing with it the stairs may move . I may have just gotten one with that problem. The music is nice it doesn't sing the whole song just a slight part of it and then stops so that's good for any parent that's worried about being driven crazy by it .Overall seems very cute and I'm very excited for my LO to open it on xmas.
",0.78399956244,toys,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and she can't stop playing with it. It was a lot bigger than what I was expecting. It comes with Elsa and Olaf. It does make sounds and sings a snippet of Let it Go, which she loves. We have all the little people princesses and she is so happy to finally have the frozen set!
",0.9736995744,toys,"I bought this, along with the Anna, Sven and Kristoff sled, for my daughter’s first birthday and it arrived on the day of her birthday. I expected it to do a little more and thought there would be more songs but she absolutely loves it and if she’s happy with it I am too. When I brought it to her she immediately recognized who it was and ran directly to it while smiling and clapping her hands. I haven’t seen her so interactive with a toy like she is with this one yet so this one is a win for me.
",0.96599620644,toys,"I have six little girls in my home daycare anxiously awaiting the release of Frozen 2.  I purchased this castle and the sled for the girls, but they’re not too interested in either one.  If I hear that Let It Go song again when the castle doors open, I’m gonna scream!
",0.544,toys,"My two kids (both under 3 yrs) love this castle! It combines the ingenuity of Little People with Disney's classic attention to detail. The baby won't let go of Olaf, the toddler loves playing 'sisters' with Anna and Elsa (we also bought the sleigh), and they both love the music and lights. It's perfect.
",0.94877213244,toys,"I have to admit it doesn’t do a lot. A few songs and flashing lights. We also ordered Kristoff’s Sleigh (sold separately) so we could have Anna, Kristoff and Sven. We have the Disney Princess Songs Castle and wanted to add Elsa’s Castle to the “neighborhood “. My 3 year old Niece absolutely loves it, so it’s 5 stars from me!
",0.8910396744,toys,"We bought this for our little Frozen fan and they LOVE this toy.  most of the items they have are only played with once in a blue moon but they play with this every single day without growing bored with it.  We also bought the sled with the other characters and they were a hit!!!
",0.84912383644,toys,"Very cute! Love how it plays music and has a bunch of interactive parts to it. Our two year old is excited!
",0.98665982545,toys,"Lego nerd and college student here. This set has some interesting figures and overall looks great on display, but it has too many stickers, and the legs don’t move among a few other things. I would recommend it if it is on sale, but I would not pay $50.00 for it. The set took me about 40 minutes to build. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:The figures are very cool. The Mandalorian features a new headpiece, and some cool armor printing on his legs and torso. He also sports a stylish cape (made of stiff fabric, not the spongy kind.) He has a black head with no face printing under his helmet. I assume this was done by Lego on purpose because of the TV show. The other figures also feature new pieces. Cara Dune’s face is double sided and the two Klatooinian Raider’s feature single sided printing.  The raider is a sturdy and tall model that does not break easily (though the guns do pop off the sides sometimes). The cockpit has some nice interior detailing. It includes some very new interesting parts including a gold-bar piece that is colored brown (seem my photos). The missiles fire very well. 540 pieces for $50 (.09 cents a piece) is a very good piece to price ratio (usually anything .10 and under is considered good).Cons:This set has way too many stickers (see my photo). These are hard to apply, especially the thin ones used on the legs. Moreover, the set seems very similar to the previous AT-ST model released only a few years ago, albeit with some different coloring and a few small updates (see my comparison.) This is disappointing seeing as the previous model’s legs have an extremely small range of motion and do not move forward past a certain point, something that remains the same in this version. This severely limits playability and makes the model more of a display piece than an actual playable model. All that being said, considering this set is on sale, I would buy it, especially if you missed out on the last AT-ST or really want the figures.
",0.89935350445,toys,"Great set with some nice minis. Definitely get it for $40 while you can. Shipping was also much faster than expected(arrived within two days if ordering)
",0.99024224345,toys,"For the price, this is a cool set that can do a lot of different things.

",0.95745599345,toys,"My son is an avid LEGO builder and collector, as well as a big Star Wars fan, so he was ecstatic when I presented him with this AT-ST Raider set from the upcoming ""The Mandalorian"" series. He kept asking, ""How did you get this?"" I didn't tell him they were already available for purchase on Amazon, because why shouldn't he think his dad is special? He's really impressed with this set and immediately got to work on it. I know that once he's finished building it and playing with it, it will occupy a place of honor with his other LEGO Imperial Walkers. As for me, I'm happy to see him happy. Plus the price is really reasonable in comparison to some other sets I've seen. May the Force be with us!
",0.97488194745,toys,"The set is for age 8+, if anything for being able to read, understand, and follow the highly detailed instructions (all graphics, no text).  There are 540 pieces here, so the level of detail is quite good.From box opening to finished model took me about 100 minutes.  There are four parts bags, and they are numbered sequentially so you only need to have one open at a time—smart.And you get four little Lego men with the set—nice.  With three weapons—nice.  And two of the weapons actually shoot—nice, some more.And you get the cool Lego brick separator tool.  Nice.  And stickers for the finished walker.Documentation: Awesome—A+ in all respects.  The manual comes in at 118 pages, with absolutely flawless step-by-step graphic instructions.  There are instructions on how to find and download the Lego app…which I did not do; it is not needed to build or play with this item.  There are some nice simple ads for other Star Wars sets in the back, complete with their kit numbers.  And you get a complete parts list.There is ample contact info, with a customer service URL, and phone numbers for the US/Canada and Europe.Price: This item comes in at approximately $40.  That’s the one downside of the branded Lego products: they tend to be expensive.  But you get what you pay for, and a Lego product is always going to be totally squared away, as this one is.Bottom Line: You cannot go wrong with Lego products, ever.  I played with them as a kid, and bought them for my kids, and now another generation is getting into it, too.  They are imaginative, straightforward and easy to construct, for the specific item, and when you’re done there are a bazillion other things you can build, all on your own.
",0.93239295545,toys,"On November 12th 2019 the first episode of the latest Star Wars series! Instead of a cartoon TV show it's live-action a high quality, original, and fresh take on the Star Wars universe! I hope it's the show we've all been waiting many years for them to create! So get excited because the future for Star Wars and Lego fans looks really bright! :DNow back to just this set. There are 540 pieces plus a few extras. The 4 characters/minifigs included are: The Mandalorian (played by Pedro Pascal from Game of Thrones), Cara Dune, and 2 Klatooinian aliens guys (new species I believe?). Then there's the main part of the set which is an old imperial AT-ST that has had several modifications, additions, replacement parts, and grafitti/paint added to it. The legs are posable, the turret turns, missiles can be fired when ready and it looks mean and ready for battle!The build was fun and straight forward. Nothing overly complicated to report. There are a few parts that take some strength to push them together/in place. It's rated as a toy for ages 8 and up which I would agree with. My nephew is 6 and we always build Legos together and we had such a blast! Now we'll be able to recreate scenes from the show and we can't wait for it to air of Disney+! We highly recommend it and know that it would make a fantastic present plus hours of fun play!
",0.95527696645,toys,"Especially at its currently marked down price, this is a great value for Lego, and the set is a really nice interesting build full of tiny details and intricately connected pieces. I love the gear system controlling the head, I was somewhat disappointed by how little the legs actually articulate, but I suppose for the stake of it being strong enough to actually hold up it's own weight, there's not much else they could have done at this size.Going at a relatively leisurely pace I was able to put this together in around 3 hours, although I am pretty good at reading and understanding Lego instructions and building them quickly, so your mileage may vary. If you set aside a weekend to put this together on and off throughout your days, you can easily get it together in that amount of time.I love how much personality this version of the AT-ST has compared to the normal all-grey Imperial walkers. If you love lego and love star wars, this is an easy recommendation.
",0.93854159146,toys,"This is a great Advent Calendar for girls, especially if they are fans of the LEGO Friends line. Like other LEGO Advent Calendars this one has a flip up design that reveals the numbered doors. Once you open the door there is a picture on the other side of the flap that shows you what to build and the image is also the instructions with the build unfinished so a child can see how the pieces go together. Each day the child builds a different small LEGO. As with the LEGO Friends line the builds in this calendar have the distinctive colors that are more pink, purple and blue. LEGO Advent Calendars are great for younger novice builders or kids that enjoy playing with the smaller pieces. My 6 year old daughter loves the LEGO Friends line so she is thrilled about this calendar. She is also still a pretty novice builder so this is a great size for her. It’s great practice for her everyday in getting the hang of following the directions for building without having step by step directions to follow. Building just based on the image is a new challenge for her. She also loves playing with smaller pieces like those in this calendar. These smaller builds also give her more experience for creating on her own with her LEGO bricks.

",0.87205636547,toys,"This really is a cute set, and it was a fairly easy and fun build.  LEGO lists it as being suitable for ages 4 and up, and that's about right.  The instructions are pretty simple with each step requiring a small number of pieces.  Young kids might need some help, but overall they shouldn't have trouble with it.It comes with some nice pieces, too.  As a completed set, I think it looks really good.  As individual pieces to use for other builds, I think that it's also great.  There are a lot of non-standard pieces included that add good value, IMO.My one disappointment with the set is that the base on the main section should have more reinforcement.  It's easy for the two halves to pop apart because the plates don't have much holding them together.  A single layer of plates under the base would have kept it together nicely.They highlight that the canoe has a special starter base to it, but I don't think it's any different than pretty much every other build from LEGO.  It was easy to make the canoe, but no easier than making the other pieces.Anyway, it's a very cute set and a fun build, but you may want to add some plates on the bottom of the base or just be careful with it because it can pop apart a bit easily.

I raised two boys, no girls and just this past year got a granddaughter so I have been interested in any girl type toys that will catch their attention as well as building STEM skills. Any girl that has fallen in love with Movie and characters from Frozen should enjoy this set. It is a smaller Lego set,  but like all Lego sets you can build a variety of scenes with it especially if there are more Legos available in the house.

It is the very simplest of lego builds, and because there are so few pieces it will be done in a flash.
",0.80014264647,toys,"While I think this set is really cute, you're going to want it to be a add on set to something else from Frozen 2. There's just not much here. And I personally think even having to pay the licensing fee to Disney the retail cost of this set is just too high.The Anna, Olaf & bunny are great figures, but they don't really make up for this costing double the piece price of most other Lego sets.That being said, it is a really nice easy set for beginners. Maybe not the 4+ on the box, but certainly 5+ should be able to do it without too much help. You know your kids best though, and if they were expects at Duplo then going straight to this set at 4 shouldn't be a problem.The small teeter-totter, slide, and canoe are really cute. But unless your kid is desperate for this particular set, I'd wait for it on sale.
",0.78428578447,toys,"This is part of Lego's simple builds intended for younger kids but look more complicated and not preschoolish. For the price, this is a very satisfactory set including Anna and Olaf and some scope for play after the build. It's one of the smaller sets for the second film, but it will make a great gift or even a set that's attainable by allowance saving for some kids. The same great Lego quality of the blocks and the instructions works here with some fun shaped pieces. Sure to be a hit with the Disney Frozen fans.

When my kids were little, the app was their brain.  Never underestimate the creativity of a young child!This set is based on Frozen II, with Anna, her friend Olaf the snowman, and a cute little bunny.  They are having fun adventures in their ice canoe, stopping along the way to ride the see-saw and take a tumble down the ice slide.  Whose face  is that on the see-saw?  That is the sleeping earth giant!The set is easy to assemble, and I included a photo of one of the instruction pages so you can see how clearly LEGO explains the steps.

It has a couple items to build - a river scene & ice canoe. The 4+ age on the box seems adequate, as she did not need any assistance. The booklet walked her through the assembly with ease; she is 6.5.After assembly, she did not seem to have much interest in playing with the scene. She just put it back in the box.
",0.547,toys,"My daughter has several of the Lego sets from the first Frozen movie and some of the sets for 4+ years old and some for the older kids and she found this slightly harder than the other 4+ year old sets to build. She enjoys using the slide on the little island.Even though her favorite character in the movies is Elsa, she still prefers to play with the Lego Olaf and rabbit figures and is also partial to the translucent pieces that look like crystals or gems. However, there aren't actually that many pieces in the kit so it's a quick build.

The package was damaged on the corners and when opened Elsa DID NOT say 14 phrases and the numbers on the back didn't correspond to what was said online that she says. Number 1 is play mode but on our dolls number 1 button, it just plays a song. Very disappointed. I contacted Amazon. Every day I learn more and more about Amazon's sellers knock off brands.

",0.93517625350,toys,"Years ago, my daughter had the original Snow Glow Elsa that sang a snipet of the ""Let It Go"" song, said a bunch of phrases, and came with an Olaf. Since we lost it, I bought this one to replace her. The face on the new version isn't as pretty as the original and it doesn't come with Olaf. This version sings the ENTIRE ""Let It Go"" song very loudly - there's no volume control, which would be nice considering you'll be hearing the song millions of times. There's also no way to stop her from singing unless you use the switch to turn her off.To operate her, you either press her necklace or raise her left arm all the way up and she starts singing. It's the ONLY thing she does. She doesn't talk at all like the older version. The dress lights up, which is pretty, but the shoes fall off constantly. She also sheds glitter from her dress constantly. Overall, not impressed for $35. My kid loves it, but she only does one thing for that price. Meh. Wouldn't recommend.

I opened door 2 and did find a figure inside. I continued opening the rest of the doors and found that doors 7 and 19 were also empty. While I was initially upset that I was missing 3 figures, after opening the left side of the packaging I found the missing figures stuck outside the plastic container but still there.The figures themselves are great. There’s a nice assortment of characters, mostly the ones you would expect but a few surprises as well. The characters are even smaller than I thought, they are just over an inch high, but they are detailed and colorful and immediately identifiable.

Unfortunately, we received the Harry Potter version instead!!The label on the outer box clearly states ""Marvel 80th Anniversary"" so not sure where/how the mix up happened.  I'm going to reorder the Marvel version and hope I get the correct item in a couple of days!  If it's anything like this Harry Potter version, it looks like it's going to be a high quality item.

Christmas count downs are always fun for the entire family and we love Funko!!
",0.89089274453,toys,"Although this seems like a great idea, the execution is seriously lacking. We received an Advent calendar with the two front “doors” adhered completely upside down. (See photos) Since the overall presentation seems like it was well thought out, I’m surprised by the complete lack of quality control. For the price I paid, I expected much better. This was a birthday gift for my son, which makes the flaw even more disappointing. I am going to try and take the doors off and try to reattach them correctly so it won’t be a total loss.
",0.11327499253,toys,"Well it's good and meh at the same time.PROS: The figures are small but the details are awesome.CONS: The selection. The red and blue spiderman is in the box as is the black suit one. There are two versions of venom. Groot is angry looking. Black Panther is completely missing - not one character. Out of 24 characters four of them are female characters (None of the women from Black Panther or the Guardians of the Galaxy). And there are characters that are not truly a big part of the MCU for current fans - ie. Daredevil. Also, would it have hurt to put the character names in their slots?
",0.20471763653,toys,"If you're looking for Groot wrapped in tinsel or Captain America in a Santa hat, you're going to be disappointed in this advent calendar. I bought two of them, one for my husband and one for a 4-year-old.  We opened my husband's wayyyy early just to make sure it was good quality before we sent the other to its child recipient.

You dont have to worry about your little one getting marker all over everything, or at least seeing marker everywhere. But, the included colors are very limited and I'm not sure how they chose the colors they did. For Example, there's no yellow or orange for the characters hair. Only brown came with it and no one but the reindeer has brown hair. We have the moana one as well and its a similar problem in that the colors that are included don't really make sense for the movie.
",0.23595309356,toys,"I've gotten a number of these types of coloring pages for the little ones in my life, and this one is one of my favorites.

",0.86021661857,toys,"This is a fun and charming LEGO Disney Frozen II Series with an Enchanted Treehouse theme for Anna and Mattias.  If you are a fan of LEGO Disney, Frozen / Frozen II, Anna, Mattias, Olaf, or of LEGO, or you think you might be, then this is a great set.  The set has some unique pieces including an Olaf figure, printed birch tree trunks, and flexible canopy roof.  Great theme elements include colorful fall foliage, fish jumping in a waterfall, fish roasting over a campfire, bunnies, and a spyglass.  I also like that the colors in the set are very lovely rich jewel tones.  Minidolls included in this set are Anna and Mattias, plus an Olaf figure, 2 bunnies, and 2 fish.The pieces come in 3 main bags, with smaller bags inside the main bags.  There are two sheets of stickers, one of which is sparkly.  Outside of the bags are an 8x16 lavender baseplate, a lavender zip line, and a flexible canopy.  When you build it, the instructions will have you build using the pieces from the bags labeled ""1"", then once those bags are completed, continue with the pieces from the bags labeled ""2"", and so on.  I've found that it's useful to open all of the bags for the particular number, but keep the pieces a little bit separate.  The pieces aren't randomly distributed between bags - instead, all of the pieces of a particular type may be in one or two bags, so if you dump the bags out and keep the pieces slightly separate, once you've found which pile your piece is in, you may find the rest of them in that same pile or in that one and one other.The instruction book has nice imagery, clear instructions, and a QR code so you can read the building instructions from a tablet or other device using the LEGO Life app.  Within the LEGO Life app, for this set, you can access the instructions on your device and download a pdf version of the instructions, as well as see an idea for an alternate build - more LEGO fun!  For the included instruction booklet, all text is provided in English, French, and Spanish, and text showing how to get the LEGO Life app is shown in 10 languages.  The instructions themselves, in usual LEGO style, are all pictures and symbols.
",0.94205850457,toys,"This is a beautiful Lego set! This set includes 3 bags of Lego pieces (302 total), a sheet of stickers, the treehouse canopy, and instruction booklet. I love the Anna and Olaf characters in this set, especially Anna with her cape. Having not seen the Frozen 2 movie yet I'm not sure about the third character- Mattias, but I assume this is his treehouse. The treehouse is not an easy build, lots of details and unique pieces. I love the furniture pieces with the sticker accents, the lantern, the bucket of water, the telescope, the jumping fish, and of course the waterfall. The forest animal and stone monoliths are the two side builds- those are easy in comparison to the treehouse. The colors are bright, appealing, and match the colors used in all of the Frozen 2 previews. Overall the entire build took me and my 5 year old an hour- you must follow the instruction booklet faithfully, especially the treehouse build and the waterfall to make sure it turns out right. Once Frozen 2 comes out and we understand how this set fits in with the storyline I imagine we'll appreciate it more. This is a beautifully detailed Frozen 2 Lego set- the older the kid the better for this. The price is high, but I would recommend it!
",0.96275854157,toys,"Frozen 2 hasn't come out yet as of this review so I don't know exactly how this treehouse set ties in to the movie, or what the four grey obelisks are supposed to be, but this is a fun build and the finished set is colorful and cute. My 6-year-old put it together for my 3-year-old and it was a fairly achievable build. I had to help out with a few pieces (the tent piece that goes over the top of the treehouse is a little tricky) but there's nothing too challenging so I think the recommended age range of 6+ is accurate. The waterfall fishing spot with a flying fiash is a great little feature. Definitely a 5-star LEGO set!There are quite a lot of stickers in this set so little kids may need help applying them neatly. The stickers on the grey obelisks are very cool because they have a holographic sparkle to them. The brown tree trunk pieces are new to LEGO and they are super cool. The zipline is a fun feature – Anna can slide down with her grapple hook.If you have a Frozen fan in your family who likes LEGO, you can't really go wrong with this as a gift. It's a great set!
",0.96197819757,toys,"My 5-year-olds were so stoked to do this and we all can't wait for the movie. Obviously, Frozen is a huge hit around our house and has been for a couple of years now. This is just every 300 pieces and an easy build. I let my children do it and I supervise so it takes longer because they are younger. I love the instructions, it's mostly pictures and as long as you can count from 1 to 10 and recognize those numbers then you can build LEGO set.This one is a fun treehouse along with the characters and of course Olaf. There is a another guy who I'm assuming will figure into new movie. There's a great little roasting station and a treasure box that is filled with fun things to play with. those tiny little things, as fun as they are however, are also so easy to lose so I make the rule they can't come off the lego table. They follow that rule occasionally.Absolutely adorable and definitely making my kids work excited to see the movie!
",0.99058872557,toys,"First of all, all LEGO sets are good. So this review is assessing whether this is a must have set, a nice to have set, or a set for someone else set.This is a small size set at 302 pieces. The set comes with a lot of smaller accessories like the treasure chest,  glasses and plates, scissors and food items. The main playable piece in this set is the treehouse. The downstair bedroom is well designed. The upstair area is covered by a plastic roof that I am not a huge fan of. As a LEGO purist I always want significant part of a structure to be made of brick parts. The bunny house is fun but quite generic.This set when combined with other Frozen II set can form a larger playable world. On it’s own I think it is limiting, unless you are a true Frozen fan, this is just a nice to have set.
",0.92388808757,toys,"This LEGO Disney Frozen II Enchanted Treehouse has been getting a lot of attention from my youngest son, who is a Frozen fan. He's a special needs kiddo who loves to build stuff with LEGOs, so he was thrilled with this set. I had almost forgotten (?!) that Frozen II was out in theaters (which we haven't seen yet), and when we opened up this set to look at the characters and such, I was like, ""Who is THIS guy?"" with one of the dudes in it. He looked very unfamiliar, but I'm assuming that he'll be in the movie to answer that question. :) Aside from ""that guy,"" the other characters included in this set were very familiar (Olaf and Anna). My son thought Anna looked a little mad on the LEGO character, due to the way the eyebrows were...but I digress (I had a good giggle, because she looks a little...funny). The fave is Olaf, who is ALWAYS the fave with anything to do in this movie...so there it is.The treehouse is simply too cool for words, including a cute little zipline! There's ""mythical stones"" and also flying fish in this set, and so many little fun details and extra items that keep my kiddo occupied with for long periods of time. Once it's all built, it's just fun to play with, pure and simple! I've never seen a funner LEGO set, and we have several now.As with any LEGO set, there's always a billion (give or take) little pieces in this set that are unsuitable for tiny kiddos who might want to stick them in their mouths, so care must be taken around them. This is definitely a set that would be extremely tempting for them if they've ever seen Frozen.Aside from that, I can't imagine a Frozen fan not absolutely loving this set. It encourages hands-on play and creativity (something we can't get enough of in today's world), and it's so adorable and a lot of fun to interact with. It definitely gets all the stars and two thumbs up from this household!
",0.98405933457,toys,"This kit is a fairly easy to assemble treehouse that children can stage some adventures it.  The treehouse design is fairly open with many different angles to place Lego-compatible characters, and there are a couple of unique designs on the buildings for different configurations.  Lego treats their licensed properties exceptionally well, and this is no exception.Anna and Olaf are in this kit from the first movie.  Mattias (new to Frozen II) is also included.  My niece complained that Kristoff (or Elsa) is not in this kit, which I can agree with considering his importance to Anna which makes the exclusion either plot revealing or puzzling.  You might want to find a Mattias Lego man to add to this kit as I think it would be more complete with him in.
",0.95077198757,toys,"I've noticed that many of the current lego kits are more like small model kits than the versatile sets I grew up with*. This set is the same (more like a model kit) with small parts and custom shapes created just for it. Though I haven't seen the movie I suspect Frozen fans will love playing with a landscape they recognize.Even though this is rated 6+ I still ended up doing much of the build for my almost 7 year old.  Other than the marks on the tree trunks and the design on the plastic roof the details on the bricks come from stickers. Unless your child has a steady hand you'll want to help them with this part.  I realize this was probably to keep cost down since a licensed product is going to cost more right from the get-go but I still would rather them printed directly to the bricks.The plastic roof isn't the only non-brick element; the cape Anna wears is fabric (similar to those that sometimes end up in kinder eggs).The reason for my lower rating is mostly the mini-figure. Some of the newer lego friend sets have hair made out of a more malleable/rubbery plastic. In this case it means the hair keeps falling off the Anna figure. Our 4 year old wanted to play with her and he kept getting frustrated with the hair and asking me to put it back on. Honestly I had a hard time getting it on.  If anyone with clout reads this review please return to the firmer plastic hair which will stay on!Overall if you have a movie fan they might enjoy this set (consider gluing Anna's hair in place) but if you just have a lego enthusiast there are better sets for your money.*I'm in my late 30's so the kits I recall were from the mid 80's through the 90's.

",0.98013955461,toys,"This is a cute toy as long as you don't plan to use the flashlight feature as you'd expect from the title. I returned the 1st one because I thought it was defective. The 2nd one isn't any better.First, it's a flashlight; so it'll need to be dark enough to see the snowflake on the ground when using. Second, I've not had much luck getting either one to turn. Instructions are simple - shine light 6 to 12 inches in front of Olaf and he'll follow. Stay within 18"". I was able to get it to turn only 3 times between the 2 Olaf's I've tried. He goes in a straight line then veers off (not the way of the flashlight). Unfortunately it doesn't contain a sensor for when it goes to a wall. He just runs into the wall and stays until you physically turn him.Also, it works on a flat, hard surface. If you don't have one or only a small one you'll be limited. The sing & move mode plays the song and Olaf goes in a figure 8. That figure 8 isn't over & over. It's actually many figure 8s. He needs space for them. He actually moves in a pattern of about 6'.Perhaps a very small child won't be frustrated cuz Olaf doesn't follow them & they have to turn him. But the point of the flashlight feature isn't pick him up & turn him around - it's supposed to follow the light!The new song is cute (although I'm already getting tired of it just trying to get it to work so I can show the 3 yr old how to operate). He has a lot to say too. Hence my 3 star ratings. If I was rating on frustration or just on the follow mode I'd give it a 1 star.Update: We FINALLY figured out how to get Olaf to ""follow"" using the flashlight. Thanks to a YouTube video for the help. Whew. It still has to be dark enough to see the snowflake from the flashlight & Olaf needs plenty of hard ground/floor but he is working. He doesn't actually ""follow"" as much as he makes 45°, 60°, & 180° turns. He appears to have a wide perphial vision so the flashlight needs to be completely out of his sight for him to turn. This will be of help to older kids. Hopefully you'll be able to help them understand (which will cut back on frustration & returns to Amazon or a store!). He doesn't so much follow you as make turns (& not always in the direction of which way I turned the light) but once I got him going properly he was more fun. Although the 3 year old doesn't understand at least her 8 year old sister does.Just Play toys certainly should have had better instructions for this toy & clarification on what they meant by ""Follow Me"" but at least he does work. I hope my review helps so your little ones can enjoy this new Olaf.

",0.9690590564,toys," This toy is adorable but certainly meant for an older kid probably between the ages of 5 and 10+. I got mine open box and it wasMissing the accessories so I couldn’t show the elephant interacting with them but it’s a little magnet that sticks to the end of the trunk and allows the elephant to throw them around and kiss them. Juno toots and sneezes and sings songs. Easy for kids for all ages to use because she has a button on her back. She also has sensors so when you pet her she does different things. Mine also didn’t come with instructions so I don’t know how to teach it things but I’m sure I can call spin master and get some. You should be able to teach her how to do things that’s why it’s better for an older kid that understands these things. If your kid likes animatronic animals I highly suggest this, I’m guessing this is going to be a popular toy this holiday because it is so cute. Juno will put herself to sleep when you don’t play with her...she covers her eyes with her ears. Very realistic looking, her eyes blink, her ears flap, her tail wiggles. Too cool.
",0.90195393664,toys,"My daughter was waiting for this package with so much anticipation—thank goodness it came fast! The commercial doesn’t do this little guy justice. It’s a lot cuter in person. The trunk looks like it has a mind of its own on tv but in reality it’s much more tame, while still being entertaining. The sounds it makes are pleasant, including little sweet songs. It hasn’t gotten on my nerves at all. It’s really charming and seems to have a lot of different things it does to keep my child’s attention.

I bought this as a birthday present for my daughter and with the condition of the box being the way it was, I decided to open it and check out the toy. The elephants feet were slightly dirty on the bottom like it has been played with before. I got the booklet out to read how to make her do her commands and she didn’t do anything other than make 1 noise! Mind you the description says she makes over 100 sounds and movements. Buyers beware :(
",0.2644551164,toys,"I almost fell over when my soon to be 6 year old only wanted this for her birthday.  I did not need another animated noisy toy.  I read the reviews and most of them were great reviews so I went along with it and also the fact that I wanted my daughter to be happy.  I won't lie, Juno is absolutely adorable!  I wish he was covered in soft fur like some others brands, but despite that, he is darn cute.  We've only had him a few days and you just can't help but smile when you look at him and he does his cute little tricks and dances.  We have a blast when he throws his peanut because you never know where it will go!

The base plate can be placed under a shirt so it can ride on your shoulder like a parrot... my daughter takes hers everywhere.It's simple, it's inexpensive but it's cute... kind of the perfect toy at this price range. This would be a GREAT choice if you need an inexpensive gift for a young person and not sure what to get.
",0.85720723965,toys,"This was fun for a little while but then my daughter lost interest. It spins around and it is magnetic to this purple base and that's how it works. The base is a little bit big and doesn't really sit well on a child's shoulder or wherever. It does come with a tail that can also be used as a bracelet. The dances really seem all the same and there isn't much to it besides it spinning a few times one way or another. So while it's cute - it loses fun value very quickly.

Looks like I'll be updating his nerf arsenal now too.

Such great quality as always and what's equally impressive, the clear base it comes with fits (very) snug into Pikachu's feet, unlike other Pops I have whereas the pegs are too small or make the thing look worse. Hopefully more Pokémon are released than there are now, by the date of this review. Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur are great additions. In my photo you can't really see him because he's, uh... little too rotund to fit on my temporary shadow box. Since the Target exclusive non-waving Pikachu is a tad too pricey and hard to find, I'd recommend this one. This one's a tad more adorable anyway.Will be moving the 'gang' onto the game console shelving I have when more Pops are ordered. Other one's too full.

There aren't really many complicated moving parts and no projectiles which is good. Olaf's three body pieces are constructed separately and attach on a swivel so they all move independently. There is a separate pencil and book you build (I guess Olaf goes to school in Frozen 2? 🤷‍♀️) but both pieces are very cool. I got this for my 4 year old. He doesn't really care for building Legos (though I know 4 and 5 year olds that like following directions and they could probably put this together with minimal help) but he loves Olaf and he loves playing with the final product.

You can move his head, arms, and torsoThe little book that he comes with is super cute and detailedCONS:Because he’s so small he is a little on the flimsy sideOverall, I think this is a great and affordable item for a frozen lover. It’s a great addition to any lego set without breaking the bank and I think children who love Olaf will love it!
",0.99477022974,toys,"My 5 year old is obsessed with Olaf so this was the perfect set to give him. He was super excited to open it and the packaging was cute and totally giftable. He was able to do most of it on his own with hardly any help from me. The directions were easy to follow and true step by step. He came out even better than expected. He has movement in his head and upper body and a few accessory pieces are interchangeable. He is a bit top heavy so he doesn't stand as well as I was hoping, but as long as he's on a super flat surface you wont have any problems. Great set. Highly recommend

The Olaf character is very cute and my son loves that he’s interactive. The different tiers of Olaf spin around, he can hold his pencil to “draw” in his sketchbook, and you can make him with or without a bow tie. I would highly recommend this set for LEGO and Frozen lovers. It can be used to play with or as a cute snowman decoration around your house. It was the perfect level of building for my 5 year old on his own.
",0.98836177674,toys,"Perfect gift for the holiday! My daughter loved this. She is three so she couldn't put it together by herself but it was a great project for both of us. It is on the smaller side but non the less a great gift!
",0.96682065775,toys,"So, the actual Shark grabber thing is pretty neat and works about how you would expect it to. My problem is with the little toy fish that comes with it. The pictures are a little deceiving and the fish are actually flat on one side. So, when you put them in water they just sink straight to the bottom of the tub and lay flat. Needless to say, the shark cannot grab them when they are laying flat on the bottom of the tub. My 4 year old likes the shark grabber and uses it to eat all of his other toys, but wants nothing to do with the fish.

",0.98069381775,toys,"My kids loved this bath toy. With baby shark being all the rage now. They loved playing with this fish eating shark. It is super easy to use and provides endless fun in the bath. A big plus to this product that the fish were designed with extra fins to make them big enough not to fall through the drain. I really appreciated that extra touch. This is a great product for bath playtime.

",0.9981999475,toys,"I saw this and thought it was great deal and a good gift for the swimming pool or bath.  I was a little concerned that 2 kids playing with it might get a little aggressive and that they could get pinched in the teeth. Once i got the item the first thing I tried was to pinch my hand to see the pressure. The pressure is enough to catch the fish but not so hard that it would leave a pinch mark on the kids. I know the kids will love it.
",0.81427389475,toys,"The concept is super cute and they did really love the shark grabber portion. The fish that come with it do not float though, so trying to grab them off the bottom of the tub with the shark grabber is pretty impossible. I also am not a fan of the metal screws that hold it together. I'm guessing that after a few bathtimes, they will rust. The kids enjoyed them during bath time and used other floating toys to grab.
",0.77134531775,toys,"This is a very cute bath toy for toddlers, through six or so.  The toy shark you hold and open its mouth go grab toy fish.  I see this as a excellent toy to teach a child how to coordinate their eye/ hand movements.  It also a Gabe to practice colors as the fish are different colors.  It is fun, and you can interact with your little one using this fun while developing their skills, and learning their colors.
",0.98220545175,toys,"1 of my kids has never yet gone into the bath on their own or without a stubborn standoff with us. i bought this toy because it looked like something i might've enjoyed as a kid as well. one night after convincing my son to get into the bath, i brought out this toy. the next night he couldnt wait to get into the bathtub to play with his new toy. he loves and it seems super fun and enjoyable. Thank You!A++
",0.92855912475,toys,"Love the idea of this, and it was instant fun for a three year old when we opened it, but I feel like I can't give it more than 3 stars because the white paint on the teeth started scratching off within the first 10 mins of play, and once we were in the bath became a big mess of white floating flecks. Maybe once the white paint parts on the teeth and eyes are all gone it will make for a good bath toy again. I wish those areas had just been white plastic.

",0.92284387478,toys,"I was planning on using this for advent this year but my kids found it early so we did it for chore prizes instead 😆 the slime is pretty good, I would compare it to the fluffy slime (if you ever make your own slime) rather than the really sticky runny slime. I like this type of slime much better because it’s easier (especially for younger kids) to play with, without making a huge mess. You don’t get a new slime every day though, sometimes it’s glitter or a mix-in. I would say it’s a pretty good product, the kids enjoyed it.

",0.18992233379,toys,"We had a great time playing this. I have a 5 year old and 2 year old and we were all able to get in on the fun. The game comes with a small ice cube trays that you use to make ice bodies for little Olaf Pawns. The board itself is a plastic tray/tub designed to hold water.The point of the game is to be the last frozen Olaf pawn remaining. You use the pop-o-matic bubble to move your Olaf around the board, but each turn you also get to try and melt an opponent in various ways, including pouring salt on them, holding them in your hands for several seconds, pouring water over them, etcIt's a little messy but the board contains the water very well. My youngest needed help to keep on track but she had fun pouring water and melting the ice. We had a lot of fun playing this together. A very family-friendly and silly gaming experience. Just make sure you dry and clean it all up nice. The old 70's Ice Cube game (of which this is a re-theme) often became gross after a while because it wouldn't get cleaned properly and that's why so few intact copies still exist.

These have a nice variety, receive paint or paint markers really well, and are always a big hit with the kids and the parents. The blank design gives us plenty of options, but my fellow teacher and and I usually come up with a few template designs for the kids to use for inspiration so they don't spend all day trying to figure out what to create and we can maximize our time working on these ornaments and other awesome Christmas crafts.

You do nothing!  You can manipulate flight pattern by putting your hand close to the drone during flight.By far coolest product ever!Got mine...get yours!
",0.96654093384,toys," This toy was a huge hit with the kids and adults , I had many adults asking where I got it and wanting one for themselves ! This was bought for my 5 year old but the entire family from age 5-55 enjoyed playing with this little guy. Charge time between play is about 15/20 mins and it runs roughly 7/10 mins, works exactly as described and seems to have a personality even . We were impressed with its ability to sense walls and other objects to avoid crashing. We were further impressed by its durability when crashing , it is very light weight and impact is very light and falling doesn’t harm it at all even from great heights. We have Catherdral ceilings in part of our home and it was a delight to watch it soar so high on its own. We can’t stop playing with this little saucer it simply is a delight, if it ever stops working we will buy another one as it is well worth the price, easy to use ,and durable if used as intended ( don’t use outside , don’t get it wet, don’t overcharge it , don’t try to make it carry anything or add anything to it ) I highly recommend this little flyer to anyone
",0.91770356984,toys,"This is perfect.  Scary good. You throw it into the air and it takes off!  I was worried that it only had 10 minutes of flying time but it’s so overwhelming that you don’t really want to have more than that.  Amazing but quite surreal. I relax when it finally lands but it doesn’t run into anything and flys around like a giant buzzing fly with flashing lights. Quite entertaining. Fun to catch and guide.  I am 68 years old. Trust me. This is fun.

Every thing was going well and then it started going up and up until it went out of sight!  It went up and away from us and we couldn’t find it.  The excitement of a six year old having a drone was short lived.UPDATE!!!What a fantastic company!  They gave me a refund and sent me a new working drone!  This one will stay inside!  My 4 & 6 year olds love playing with it.
",0.89660525384,toys,"A very cute toy for my seven-year-old. It lights up and the lights change colors. We played with it for hours although it does need to be charged pretty frequently. He is able to quickly grasp how to use the toy and move it in all directions.
",0.85137319684,toys,"I originally wrote a negative review for this toy....I have to take it all back!  This is a wonderful toy, just follow the directions.  First, there are little screws holding in the toy.  The screwdriver is under the toy with the charger.  The directions fail to tell you this piece of information.  You will break the toy if you try to remove it without removing the screws.  Charging and calibrating were cake and the drone flew well afterward.  Our grandson will enjoy this. My husband and I were thinking of buying another for ourselves!
",0.17431822484,toys,"To be honest, when my husband purchased this for our small grandsons, my first though was what a waste of money. I was wrong. My older grandson absolutely loves this thing. He is only 14 months old, but constantly holds it out to have us launch it again. The drone is actually safe for his fingers -- even at 14 months, his fingers are too big to fit between the slots. My only complaint is that you have to charge it constantly, but on the plus side, the charging time is relatively quick. It actually worked out quite well.
",0.1863934184,toys,"How awesome this is!Purchased for my grandson's 6th birthday.I know it says 14+ but reviews made me want to give it a shot.At 1st appearance I thought it appeared flimsy, however I put it to the test and was pleasantly surprised.It withstood some good collisions and my dog attacking it.

",0.07692873586,toys,"I purchased this for a present for my daughter. It says it's cotton candy scented and it doesn't smell like it smells like poison or some kind of chemical. The smell lingers and is nasty. Now I can't even give it to her better off in the trash and out of kids hands.
",0.12663635686,toys,"Exactly as expected, my daughter is going to love it.
",0.82526445486,toys,"My 4 year old was really excited when she saw this. It came nicely packaged in a bright, colorful popcorn shaped box. Her excitement quickly faded after we opened it and realized it's really not anything special. It's feet fold into the piece of fabric on the back when you pull it down but even that feature quickly lost it's appeal.PROS:· Cute stitched on facial features.· Soft and plush. Perfect for snuggling.· Good size, not too big.· The included eye mask has a very soft, furry furry material and looks adorable on the llama.CONS:· We received the wrong product. Stuffed animal pictured has a completely different outfit and is covered in pink fur, whereas our llama is all purple.· Llama's hair is not soft and fluffy as pictured. It's matted down and looks used.· This thing sheds like you would not believe! We've had it less than a day and I'm already sick of cleaning up tiny pieces of fur.· One of the ""surprise gifts"" was a small bracelet with stretchy string and a cute llama face. It was just the right size for my 4 year old, but about 10 minutes after taking the photo the bracelet snapped and broke. I would expect slightly better quality from a $40 toy.· There isn't much of a chocolate smell anywhere on the stuffed animal. I sniffed everywhere and only got a tiny whiff for a quick second.· Eye mask is super small. Way too small for my 4 year old. We attempted to put it on her but the string looked like it was going to snap.· Seriously expensive for a stuffed animal. Way overpriced.Overall, I couldn't knowingly recommend this to anyone because of the poor quality and you're not guaranteed to get the right product. Mainly though, the shedding is what made me give this such a low rating. Ours will probably end up in the trash.
",0.21981471886,toys," This is the cutest and funniest stuffed animal to receive in a popcorn container. It makes opening super exciting for your kiddo. Watch my video of my daughter opening hers. The eye mask doesn’t fit my almost 8 year old head so maybe it’s meant for the llama? My daughter does like eye masks to sleep in so at least her llama can wear it but it would be cute if they had matching sets.Let me just say this is cuter in person than I thought it would be. The fur and body is soft and makes a good bedtime cuddle buddy.If you find my review helpful, please select the helpful button below.  Thanks!
",0.960361686,toys,"The pink popcorn box is very cute, but that's where it ends!  There should be a way to get the llama out of the box so that it can be used over and over again.  I managed to get my llama out without tearing the box, but let me tell you, it is really hard!  There is just no need to make it that difficult to get into the box.  We all know the box isn't meant to last or it would be made out of plastic.  But come on . . . it should last for a little while.The llama itself is so adorable.  The llama I received is mostly pink with some purple mixed in -- totally little girl colors!!!  The llama is sure to be a hit with any little girl.  Pajama llama is very well made.  I'm an expert seamstress and have also made sewn toys.  I can tell it is well stitched.  Stuffing in the neck, arm tops and leg tops is sparse to allow the llama back piece to cover the arms and legs when it is flipped (which by the way is a very cute/fun feature.  Over time, with yanking and tugging to flip the back piece again and again, the seams could give way.  Since I can't look at the seams from the inside, there is no way to know if the llama can stand up to constant flipping of the back piece.  I guess time will tell.I have sniffed the llama all over.  I can't even detect a whiff of marshmallow scent!  That really isn't an issue for me.  But kids who receive this llama are going to expect for it to smell nice.  So in that sense, it's not good that there is no detectable scent.I had my llama out of the box for about an hour -- handling it, checking seams, pulling and tugging.  I didn't shed much.  But I wasn't playing with it.  I did pull some loose pieces of fur out and had a hard time getting it off my hands because of static.  I even ran my hands over and over the fur, trying to get it to shed.  It didn't.  I'm in no way discounting what others have said.  It's just not my experience.The llama's sleeping mask is just adorable!.  It seems kinda' funny, however, that the eyes on the mask are open.  It would make more sense if they were closed.  But I doubt little kids will care about that.What I care about is that $40 is a lot of money for this stuffed toy.  $20 seems much more reasonable and appropriate.  If you can get this at a more reasonable price, I would definitely recommend purchase because this pink and purple llama is totally adorable and huggable!
",0.23098900986,toys,"My 18-month-old daughter LOVES llamas so we had to get this toy.  When it first arrived I was a bit frustrated with the popcorn box package.  Took me a few minutes to figure out how to get the toy out!  We opened the surprise box and got the eye mask and hair tie which are cute accessories for the child. My daughter was excited about this llama and immediately began cuddling it as it is very soft and cuddly. I am happy that it is a decent sized toy for a child to cuddle.  It has a slight scent of marshmallows, but it's hard for me to smell.  The neck of the toy is very thin which makes me nervous about it ripping.  I am also not thrilled with the fact that I've already noticed pieces of fur coming off the toy.  My 5-year-old son thought it was really cool how the llama folds into its sleeping bag pouch.  It took him a minute to figure it out, but now he keeps doing it.  When it is not folded you could put items in the pouch on the back.  My son has actually been sleeping with the llama, so it is a big hit at our house.  Overall a great item, but again I'm worried about the thin neck eventually being ripped and I don't believe it is worth the current price.
",0.1627146386,toys,"My 7 year old daughter loves this Pikmi Pops! She has not stop playing with it. Like a lot of Pikmi Pops this one comes with a really cute presentation which is wrapped up like a box of popcorn with only the top of the head peeking out. I was worried that the part we could see had matted hair that was not plush and soft but the rest of the body is very different. Once you open the box you will reveal the llama in a sleeping bag which even has a printed zipper detail that my daughter loves and a small box. The box has two doors to open for slumber party surprises. One door reveals a really cute llama face charm on a bracelet and the other is a soft plush face sleeping mask. My daughter loves playing with the sleeping mask on her llama. Do make sure to open up the box before discarding. Ours had an invitation inside with no door to access it. The cardboard invitation is cute and a fun accessory my daughter likes playing with.It has a nice smell to it but it seems to be on the fabric more than on the plush. The pink plush is much softer than the purple and pink matted fur on the top of its head. The best part is the ability to flip it in and out of the sleeping bag which really makes it fun for play. My daughter really loves this feature and I think it really keeps her interested in playing with it. It’s easy for her to flip back and forth. The fact that it is attached is a great feature so it can’t be lost! It’s not as squishy as the smaller Pikmis and it’s not that soft around the middle which might be a compromise for the flip feature. She has a really cute face and adorable accessories. This would be a great gift for any Pikmi Pops or plush fans. My daughter loves her!

I've not yet been able to test how long they last but it's still going strong after 2 hours play. It's taken a few knocks as well into the skirting boards and is still going and no marks have been left.It is best used on hard floors.

It is much quieter than I expected it to be and the flashing lights make it easy to see even if your room has curtains closed, or blinds shut. It is very lightweight, so easy for a child to hold and the trim around the ball area seems solid enough. It bashes off the furniture quite merrily without leaving a mark and because it is contained to the floor makes it much less risky that your valuables are going to get smashed.

We are lucky to have a nice large space of around 16 feet.Anything with LED lights suits my son extremely well ( he even sleeps with an ASD light bulb so you can see why he loves them).

",0.93421542688,toys,"These are just too cute!
",0.94474780689,toys,"I really like how this figure came out but the one recurring issue i keep having with this guy is that his left butterfly joint is stuck. This is my second mandalorian figure first one being first edition and that one had the same issue. Laslty i'd like to say that storing long rifle as well as blaster is a bit of a pain as the latch for the holster for the blaster doesn't wanna close when the blaster is in it then the long rifle doesn't go all the way in the slot and tends to detach easily. I still would overall recommend getting this figure as he is the saught after one out of this wave plus he's just awesome looking and any star wars fan would love it.
",0.09939736189,toys,"I'm excited for any content related to Mandalorians (like the show coming out soon), but this figure is one of the weakest Black Series 6-inch figures released.As others have mentioned, the paint application is just lackluster and looks like a rushed / botched job on this figure, relative to what we're seeing elsewhere. Especially with the fact that Hasbro didn't need to try to photo-real a face, anything added to this figure's paint job aside from paint-by-the-numbers would have been a tremendous improvement.The joints are probably the biggest detractor from the figure. My figure's joints are all extremely loose, to the point that he won't stay standing for more than 5 minutes, because that's as long as his joints can sort of maintain a pose. His long rifle does not fit in the peg hole that it's supposed to, so it just barely clings to his should strap. Further hurting the fit and finish is the fact that the blaster holster won't snap closed, because the holster isn't wide enough to hold the blaster and to allow the peg of the holster strap to pass through the holster's hole.The dull paint job and the ""this is not the quality control you're looking for"" approach to this figure makes me question the quality of this figure's entire wave, and really makes me disappointed in Hasbro because they've been killing it with these figures lately.If you're an in-box collector, you already know that Amazon is hit or miss. I don't care (too much) about the packaging for this figure, but the plastic was broken, two corners were crushed, and other areas of the packaging had some noticeable wear and/or wrinkling.That said, I think that this is one figure I would have been happier leaving in the box. It's like meeting your childhood hero, only to find out that he's an alcoholic.To the point I make in the title, I've purchased knockoffs of Black Series figures that are way better quality in terms of paint apps, joints, fit and finish, than this figure. If you want the definitive version, be patient and wait for Figuarts.
",0.09008023189,toys,"Very posable 6"" figure with plenty of articulation. Good paint and weathering effects and overall subdued color scheme appropriate for a bounty hunter not trying to stand out in a crowd.Of the included accessories, two weapons, the rifle is the standout and reminiscent of the one carried by Boba Fett in the Star Wars Holiday Special cartoon. The blaster pistol is somewhat small and lackluster looking too much like a standard Luger you'd find on a WWII German solider figure. The hands of the figure do a great job gripping both weapons with his finger on the trigger ready for action. The rifle is made to key into a slot on the figures back, as if slung over his shoulder, and, for the most part, it works ok. The blaster fits fine into the holster attached to the non-removable waist belt.The biggest drawback is the cape which is permanently attached and made of a thick plastic/rubber that can hinder many of the possible poses. A fabric cape would allow for more dynamic positioning and likely look better, too.Overall, a nice action figure who looks menacing and is a nice departure from the classic Boba Fett color palette.
",0.94178938989,toys,"The box wasn’t too beat up when I got it but the figure itself isn’t that. The paint is lacking and the head is loose and oddly shaped. The guns are great though. Cape is lose and stiff. I’d wait for a better figure.
",0.06935241889,toys,"The product was not new. It was clearly opened and repacked in a bad way. Something is really wrong with the face, or is defective product from Hasbro or a KO.
",0.04889795289,toys,"What was pleasantly surprising was the Mandalorian 6"" Black Series has normal hips just like Hasbro's Marvel Legends do. I'd like to know which other Black Series figures have this superior hip joint. The bad thing was upon opening I saw a ""T"" indentation on the kneecap and realized it's missing the kneecap. I confirmed this by checking jedibusiness figure database's photo which showed a gray color separation kneecap. I saw a youtube review where the shoulder armor piece fell off. Quality control issues with the first batch? The shoulders have limited movement. The shoulder strap has a rectangular hole which I'm assuming is meant for the rifle peg to go through that and into the notch in the back.
",0.10770389,toys,"Great looking figure and the most popular of this wave. Not to be passed on my fellow collectors
",0.91350936989,toys,"All in all, a great figure. Nice sculpt, good paint apps, and great attention to detail on Hasbro’s part. Only problem is the cape. In the show the Mandalorian has a full length cape. For this figure they sculpted what looks like a half-cape. Also, it’s sculpted plastic, not soft goods like it SHOULD be. If that were the case, it’d be the best Black Series figure of the year. Still worth the purchase, especially if you’re loving the show
",0.95445215789,toys,"Not a bad figure for $13 in Warehouse Deals. Excellent articulation. Good paint app. Definitely excited for the show even more now. No complaints here except the cape could have been made with cloth instead of plastic.
",0.87607085789,toys,"A fantastic figure with exquisite details throughout!
",0.9353999590,toys,"I bought this for my 4 year old son and he loooved it! The robot can walk, talk, dance even fart! Great gift
",0.89680826790,toys,"Super Cool Toy Purchased for 11 year old boy & he loved it. It does not come with batteries for the remote or robot it takes 3 AA & 3 AAA. It has a weight to it so hopefully it will last him a long time. All the other kids thought it was the coolest toy ever. It was a hit
",0.86094695390,toys," We’ve gone through a few RC toys, but this one is a step up in quality.  It’s not our first MiBRO either—we have the original blue and white robot as well.  We've had him over a year, and he still works just fine.  These robots are solidly built and have enough features to keep kids entertained.  The controller is easy to operate—besides two regular movement controls, there are four specialty buttons.  MiBRO can dance by himself, make sound effects, allow kids to talk in funny voices or become a secretive listening device.  There is an explanatory picture on each action button (rather than words) to help identify what they do.  For instance, a musical note is shown for the dance button.Some features work better than others.  MiBRO dances very well, obeys moving commands and has pretty good sound quality (volume is adjustable, but be aware this is a loud toy in general).  The voice changer and listening modes often require a little maneuvering for optimum performance.  Sometimes the robot just produces feedback noise, but that can be eliminated if the distance between MiBRO and the remote control is increased or if there is a barrier between them.  The remote control/robot range is about 30 feet.  If you have two robots like we do, each must be on different radio channels to avoid control interference (there are only two channels on each robot, so no more than two toys can be played with at the same time).MiBRO’s accessories are more for decoration than anything else.  He has a clip-on gold trophy and rad blaster that make him look adorably silly.  A little clip-on tray can carry lightweight objects (up to 0.8 lb limit) or turn into a soccer goal (soccer ball also included).This toy gets played with a lot, and that’s the reason we ordered a newer version, which essentially has the same features as the original.  We have fun playing with two robots, especially when friends visit.  The boys like having pretend soccer matches and teasing each other in stealth mode.  The sound effects are a little gross, but our kids think they're neat--there are quite a variety of comical sounds and phrases.  Some of our favorites are, “Get your hands up, you dirty varmint” and “I come in peace.”  The robot powers down if not played with after about a minute, but he powers right back up by pressing a button found on his stomach.We’ve had no problems with these RC toys, but we do treat them with care.  They consistently work well, but take a lot of batteries.  The robot requires three AA and the remote needs three AAA.  As mentioned before, this toy is rather noisy, but that’s part of the fun.  The video shows just a small sampling of what the robots can actually do, but it adequately represents some of this robot’s sounds and movements.
",0.96930575490,toys," It won't go straight.  The left drive wheel turns probably half speed compared to the right.  Kiddo doesn't want to return it, he's attached to it apparently haha so thats why not putting 1 star across the board but to pay this much for a small rc vehicle, this is disappointing to have it not work properly out of the box.
",0.04606258990,toys,"my 7 year old loves this,  nice engaging toy.
",0.98465728890,toys,"Remote doesn’t even work has something loose inside
",0.590,toys,"The kids really like this little robot and play with it more than I expected them too.It has personality and appeal that adds to the fun of it.The ability to transform and speak your voice is a great feature. So is the microphone for remotely listening with it.The soccer ball, trophy, blaster, and tray are worthy accessories that expand the capabilities and fun of the robot.I will say that it does have a few issues for me. I wish it had variable speed control. It is just an on/off or rather go/stop motion. This tends to spill or knock over anything it's carrying on the tray. Also since the tracks go to the front and back of the robot fully it has a tendency to tip over easily. It will end up on its face or back depending of which direction your were traveling.It does have a good amount of power to it and traverses our carpet easily. The AAAx3 in the transmitter and AAx3 in the robot are best served up with some AmazonBasics batteries. It seems to get good runtime with them.I have found that if you start turning first and then go forward you can mitigate the tendency to tip things over that are on top of the tray. If this had variable or soft start forward and reverse then I would have given it 5 stars. Otherwise it is providing some fun for the kids. It has good range at about 20 feet and they are having fun with it around the house. Probably best for ages 6-12.
",0.87965524290,toys,"Requires 3 AA and 3 AAA batteries which are not included. You will need a Phillip's head screwdriver to open the battery compartments.This is a fun little remote controlled robot. It looks cut and I love the Amazon exclusive gold color. It's eyes light up, just peel the sticker off. It moves on two rubber tracks which tend to pick up any dirt or pet hair in it's path. But don't get any ideas about using this to clean even though it claims to be a butler as well. It will take some finesse to pick up even small, lightweight objects. Probably fun a few times for kids but the novelty will eventually wear off.It is loud. Not just the noises which can be turned off but also just moving it around with the remote.At the time of this review the retail price was around $40 which is fairly reasonable for the quality although I think it should come with batteries for that price. If you can get it on sale it is a good value for a fun little toy.
",0.90195155190,toys,"We tend to keep our expectations low when it comes to less expensive remote control toys.  Accordingly, we were pleasantly surprised with this particular toy.  This robot has a lot of features and is generally easy to control.Out of the box, we had to locate batteries and a Philips head screwdriver to open the battery box.  Fortunately, we keep a large stock of AA and AAA batteries for the robot and the remote control, respectively.  After installing the batteries, we were ready to rock!Given that the manufacturer advertises a ""stealth"" mode, we were surprised at the loudness of this robot when it moves.  Unless the television, stereo, video game, or other electronic device has the volume on high, this robot could only sneak up on a deaf person, or someone sleeping.The robot has lots of cool features.  There are simple movement controls, and four buttons for dancing, making sound effects and talking (over 50 phrases and sounds), listening to someone through the built-in microphone (parents, make sure this little guy is not under your bed at night!), or making anyone talk in funny voices.  The only real issue is that the robot has two movement modes:  move and not move.  That means this little guy is kind of jerky when he takes off and when he stops.  While that rapid take off can be an advantage sometimes, like when hitting a ball, when carrying stuff in his little tray it can cause over-balancing and either the item comes flying off or the robot tips over.  Oops!This little guy comes with a trophy, for what we are not sure.  Maybe winning at soccer?  He also has a carrying tray for small objects, as long as the objects are not too tall so that they might tip or come flying out when the robot starts and stops.  MiBro Gold comes with his own soccer ball, and with a bit of careful control he can ""kick"" the ball into the tray, which can serve as a goal.  Lastly, this guy includes a blaster and matching laser sound effects.  Did we mention a flashing light on the front?  Yeah, MiBro Gold has that too.Okay, we like this little guy.  He has lots of nifty features, though variable speed control would have been nice.  Otherwise, he has everything we could want, and maybe a bit more, for the price.  Accordingly, we rate the value as above average.  We have seen other robots that do less that cost more!As for our overall rating, we go with five stars.  This little guy is a lot of fun, though excessive playing can drive a parent to distraction!  He moves forward and backward, dances, makes obnoxious noises, can be a little spy, though not very quietly, and can carry a treat.  What fun!Enjoy!
",0.89756500790,toys,"By far the Best Remote Control Robot We have ever played with. Not only is it extremely easy to navigate, but it has different modes and talents and one unique personality!! This guy loves to prank and make burp and fart noises whenever possible. It can listen in on conversations and can also be talked through. The combination of commands are endless. We have played with him for weeks now and have yet to get bored with it. We have all grown to love it and it’s a guaranteed laugh whenever he is out and about.

",0.81936097191,toys,"My two and four year old daughters give this an enthusiastic 5 star rating — it definitely keeps them entertained.

I am constantly being asked to repair things on this castle by the kids and I’m about two repairs and a glass of wine away from just gorilla glueing the whole thing together!

",0.90953117691,toys,"We received the box and couldn’t wait to give it to our granddaughter for her Birthday. It is plastic, so I think the price is a bit steep, but it’s Disney.... and Frozen 2, so I guess it’s justified.  In their minds anyway.

I’ve attempted to contact Hasbro three times this week and have had no luck. Every time I call, it says they are closed. I can’t even get a live person on the phone.  So, I’m a bit frustrated.

",0.98065155792,toys,"Great minifigures but not my favorite Y-wing build.  I love Y-wings and this does the job, but the changed elements aren’t all for the better and the color scheme is a bit drab the stickers are necessary for color flow which is a let down for me and many who refuse to stickers.  The teal Astromech Droid is a beautiful addition to Lego’s Droid roster a must buy for me just on that alone.
",0.8103576992,toys,"awesome, for my grandson and my husband wants to play with it! lol
",0.88537102992,toys,"I can’t help but compare this new version of the Y-Wing to the previous version from Rogue One (75172). This new Resistance Y-Wing has a bit of a sleeker front and is also a little longer than the yellow one. But if you already have the Rogue One version, this one isn’t terribly different.I’m not a big fan of stickers in Lego sets, and I’m going to complain about them for this set. I am obsessive about having my stickers line up perfectly, especially when they are central to the look of the set, as they are here. Because the stickers have straight lines, it’s very obvious if they’re applied crookedly. When I assembled the set, I wasn’t in the mood to be fiddly, so I didn’t apply the stickers. The set looks quite dull without them.There’s one other big thing I have to critique Lego for: on the box art, it looks like the printing on the canopy is an opaque white, to better match the rest of the cockpit. It’s actually more of a translucent grayish white in person, which doesn’t look great and seems a bit deceptive to me.Obviously, it’s impossible to know how much of a role Y-Wings will play in The Rise of Skywalker, since the film isn’t out yet. The set includes the minifig for Zorii Bliss, a character we also don’t know anything about yet. So far, this is the only set in the newest wave of Star Wars sets to include Zorii. To perhaps help keep the mystery of the character, the minifigure has a black head rather than one with facial printing.
",0.22882339492,toys,"This LEGO set has 578 pieces and noted to be for ages 8 and up.  My son is 12, and he was able to put it together in under 3 hours.  There were no pieces missing.  However, he does report one area of difficulty during construction.  There are two engine nacelles on this spacecraft.  Each is surrounded by 4 very long pylons.  Two round pieces (look like steering wheels) are attached in front of each nacelle.  My son had to make adjustment and space the two round pieces slightly further apart on the port side engine nacelle.  The reason was because the 4 pylons just couldn’t snap in a smidgen more.Aside from this construction flaw, my son enjoys playing with it.  Here are what he thinks is terrific about this toy:1) As you’re “flying” the spacecraft, you can turn the black knob on the back and bombs drop out.2) two missiles can be shot out by bending them slightly.  Watch out and make sure nobody is standing in front because it shoots out very quickly.3) There is a gun turret that rotates and spins.4) cockpit opens so he can place a figurine in there. The droid has its own seating area behind the gun turret.5) The landing gear is retractable6) Most important, it’s not heavy at all.My son loves the features of this Resistance Y-Wing Starfighter.  We all can’t wait for the movie to come out in theaters.!
",0.592,toys,"The Y-wing starfighter was unveiled to the world all the way back in 1977 in the very first Star Wars film (now Episode IV: A New Hope). Its onscreen presence has grown over the years, including screentime in Rogue One as well as two Star Wars animated series, The Clone Wars and Rebels. Now the legendary craft makes its way to the sequel trilogy in the upcoming Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker.Considering its many appearances it is not surprising that LEGO has released several prior versions of this craft. Despite that, the red color scheme is new from all earlier releases and the design itself continues to be refined and changed. The stickers are fairly instrumental in bringing the red color scheme to life and I recommend applying them. There are only eight and getting them straight isn't too difficult with a bit of patience. The sheet in my set arrived fairly crumpled, with one sticker lifting a bit off the sheet, but happily the adhesive was sound and it adhered as firmly as the others.The included minifigs are fantastic. The intriguing and mysterious Zorri Bliss makes her LEGO debut, with a solid black head under the helmet telling us nothing of the character's appearance in the film. Poe Dameron is in his desert fatigues and there is a single piece, attractive figure of new droid D-0 to accompany him. The teal astromech looks fantastic and is a welcome expansion to the fairly extensive line of LEGO droids. Finally there is a First Order Snowtrooper: familiar from the earlier minifigs for The Force Awakens but this one has a white cape to stand apart.The build is straightforward and enjoyable. Naturally there is some repetition in the engine nacelles but not a terribly substantial amount. Completed, the model rests on three simple landing gear and looks great on the table. There is a play function to let the Y-wing drop three bombs which works great. There are also flick-fire missile shooters housed under each wing for more play fun.Episode IX looks to have an array of familiar Original Trilogy starfighters included but this Y-wing is nicely differentiated from prior releases: a must-have if this is your first Y-wing and worth strong consideration even if you have one or more prior ones.
",0.97910267192,toys,"LEGO Star Wars 75249 adds the Resistance Y-Wing Starfighter ship to the fleet in time for the ninth installment, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. In addition to the fighter, the minifigs include an updated Poe Dameron, an unnamed teal/green astromech and First Order Snowtrooper, to go along with new Zorii Bliss and D-O droid. I think the build as a process and a finished product seems worthwhile. It’s a good set with the new minifigs and the detail added over prior Y-Wing releases for my liking. The set comes in at 578 pieces.There might be some Y-Wing fatigue after other prior versions have been well represented in LEGO bricks. I still enjoyed this version because the updates were enough to make it fresh, at least pending the movie’s release to see it in action. I really like the new astromech as its distinct color sets its apart. The bombing drop mechanism is fun for the kids the play around with.This resistance-era update incorporates a modified design and red coloring accents you see most apparent on the nose/ front fuselage as compared the Rogue One release of the Rebellion Y-Wing 75172. Obviously this Y-Wing differs from the detail of the larger Ultimate Collector’s Series 24” scale of set 75181, but also an alternative to the yellow Rebellion coloring, too.I wasn't able to find a glaring weakness, except for some personal disdain for the stickers rather than printed pieces. Maybe the First Order will have better luck in the movie.

He loved that it can drop bombs and loves shooting with the lasers. He says it fits perfectly in his hands for flying around. He loves how it looks and all the details on it. The landing gear can be moved up or down. He loves that the droid can sit like they do in the movies but is also perfectly spaced to sit on top. He loves the included minifigs which are a lot of fun for play. He has built a lot of LEGO type planes but he really loves the detail in the cockpit of this one with the console.

My wife and I enjoyed playing!Positive attributes:-Great two player game!!! I am constantly looking for games that I can play with my wife, and two player games are really hit or miss. With the base game, you can play with 4 people, but this is really fun with two. We each had three characters to control since we played with the expansion, so we were loaded down with a lot of choices for strategy, which is great.-SO MANY BITS! This game is awesome for all the little high quality pieces. The player pieces, of course, are awesome. But the point markers, player cards, scenario cards, items, dice, and everything else are so great! Getting a point is such a tactile moment because you pick up a blue crystal to add to your pile. And moving the big head pieces around is really fun.-The potential for mixing and matching characters and games is really exciting. I'm imaging playing a game where Bellatrix is partnered with Blanche from the Golden Girls, and it makes me laugh.-The game board is great- awesome artwork, interesting set up, and you get two options as the board is reversible.-Mechanics and game play are easy, but fun. The first few moves as you spread out your pieces on the board are pretty straightforward, but they get more complex. And the individual powers make decisions interesting.""Not so positive, but still not a problem"" attribute:The scenarios and some of the goals could be a bit more thematic. One scenario is basically ""capture the flag"" with a side of retrieving points on the board marked A-D. I understand that some of the themes are probably generic because they will be making an infinite number of versions for different fandoms, but it would have been awesome if a bit more effort was put into theming these scenarios. There's a little vague blurb at the top of each scenario that tries to sell it, but I would have liked to be trying to steal or protect actual thematic items (like horcruxes) instead of tokens with A-D printed on them. But, once again, the A-D point pieces are used in many of the scenarios, so assigning them as an actual thematic item might limit their use, or complicate their use over multiple scenarios. All that said, I felt like the HP kids and villains were playing capture the flag instead of battling it out over something thematic.This game will surely please fans of strategy games, and buying a version from their fandom heightens the enjoyment a great deal! My wife and I really like Harry Potter, and it was fun to add commentary and imagination as the characters face off or chase after each other.
",0.97694927594,toys,"I had seen this product in a store, but ended up ordering it here. I'm a Harry Potter fan, though this is my first experience with Funko. We have begun having family game night every Sunday and we're looking for games our kids can play with us that aren't just basic games. We have a 7 yo and a 5 yo. The game took a little for the 7 yo to get into, and the 5 yo definitely cannot play on his own, but, since this game can be played in teams, it works!I think that we got the hang of this game the second time we played. If we had just been playing with adults, I think we would have had it in no time, but everything is more complicated with children. That being said, we did enjoy it and will like having it in our growing game collection. This game would be fun with kids, or just adults. It begins to be more interesting as you get more strategic.The figures are super cute and very detailed. I have had no previous experience with Funko, so I was really surprised by how well these are made and the detail. It is really neat that their hands are able to hold the items them come with the game (Felix Felicis and a dagger). I'm thinking that we may by the Harry Potter expansion pack that has Ron and Malfoy to go with this!
",0.90194094294,toys,"I purchased this game on Amazon and upon receiving it was really impressed with the quality of every piece and the maps. Of course the Funko figures are the best quality. I really enjoyed playing this game with my family. The game has enough strategy to be enjoyed by classic board game lovers and enough pop culture to be fun for everyone!One thing to know is that each side uses 3 characters, and this set only has 4 Funko figures (the other two characters are tokens). I recommend purchasing another base set or “expandalone” set so you can play the game without tokens.The games includes two maps (the board is double-sided) and 4 different scenarios. I found that I preferred some maps and scenarios to others. The great thing about having is options is that you can choose the set-up that you enjoy the most.The game hits the right balance between simplicity and complexity. I can’t wait to play with my extended family over the holidays. I recommend Funkoverse.
",0.97973662694,toys,"Our family was provided an Amazon gift card in the mail from FunkoVerse games to purchase any of the new FunkoVerse strategy games or the related expansions. This was one of the sets that we chose to purchase with the gift card.The set is well made, The map is fairly large and made of a sturdy game board material. The characters are representative of the Funko style with the oversized heads and comically round eyes and are fun to move around the map. The pieces are well designed and scale well with the board and characters. I ended up ditching the plastic insert that housed the pieces in the sealed box. I am not sure if it was intended for use after unpackaging but we opted not to use it. I liked that several ziplock bags of different sizes were included to organize the pieces for storage.The gameplay is fairly complex but is well structured (rounds, turns, phases) and after some practice there is a consistent rhythm that keeps the game moving. The instructions are clear although as with all games it is easier to learn by playing a few times. There are also YouTube videos which we did not view. There is an abbreviated tutorial in the instructions to get started. We found this to be very helpful and then added in the more complicated components once we were comfortable with the basics. There are illustrated explanations of the basics maneuvres (visibility, moving around obstacles, attacking etc.) which are necessary as there are subtleties to most aspects of the game.We have played several of the provided scenarios on both sides of the double sided map. The different layouts (the more open Room of Requiremnt vs. the shops and streets of Diagon Alley) definitely lend themselves to different strategies which keeps the game dynamic and fun. The turn based rounds are balanced and well thought out. The most enjoyable part of the game is to conceive a plan against your opponent and then try to execute the scheme, much like Harry and team in the books. You will need solid tactics and a little luck to succeed. My favorite aspect of the game is it's ability to expand. We have also played with the expansion set that includes Ron and Malfoy and that added new elements to the game. But even more than that, with a little creativity and effort, it would be very possible to expand on the base set to create your own campaigns, maps, characters and items for a limitless number of scenarios.

",0.93517917494,toys,"This game is great for 2 people! Takes a bit to figure out the rules but the different modes are great!
",0.96053481195,toys,"I've done lego (and lego-like, including nanoblocks) for many years.  I was impressed at the clarity of the instructions and the way it was laid out.  I had to change my normal method of setup because it was all geared to clearly numbered bags rather than color and shape of pieces.  The inclusion of a brick separator came in handy because, even with the outlined areas of new pieces for that step, errors did happen.Unlike most kits of this kind, there was really no symmetry to work with other than the head (eyes and ears).  That made it far more difficult to do than something like a building or a ship.Where this lost one star was that beginning with ""bag 10"" (the start of the head), there was no more outlining of where the pieces went.  With the head being smaller and more complex, that added difficulty where it really didn't need to be.Not including the little stand with the information and the (non leg-moving) mini-yoda, this model weighed 2 pounds 13.6 ounces.  It would have been even heavier if there weren't hollow spaces within the main sections (sides, front, back, head) on top of the hollow interior.  Using the internal framework and just attaching to the outside was really neat!Be careful when you put on the head - don't lay him directly on his back -- the pin holding his head in place may come out!  It ""locks"" into place when you put on the back of the head. :)Overall - I enjoyed myself.  I bought this for ME!
",0.1886654295,toys,"This really is a great looking set. My bad review is solely based on the fact that we are up to 6 missing pieces and some are now for his face..... Sure we can make due but for how much these cost for the love of god do better LEGO. Now I’ll order the replacement pieces... but still...

",0.595,toys,"Used for birthday gift
",0.96072566595,toys,"This is a pretty cool lego set if you are into Star Wars collectibles, or know any younger (or older) Yoda fans.  My 11 year old son isn't really into Star Wars, but he still felt the kit was pretty interesting and the build itself was fun.In terms of typical ""pieces/dollar"" value rating, this set is a very good deal at ~$100 for almost 1800 pieces, but there are many small pieces in this set.  It comes with 13 numbered bags of pieces, plus an unnumbered bag with some of the internal frame/structure parts plus a ""rod"" that helps keep it together.  And of course the instruction manual, which is more of a book (it is THICK) than a manual.  As is usually the case with Lego sets, they do a great job with the instructions.While the box indicates the age range is for 10+, the listing description says 12+.  If you have a 10 or 11 year old that is really good at building Legos, they can probably handle it, but otherwise the 12+ range recommendation is probably more accurate.  (Although kids' ability to build lego sets seems to vary quite a bit).  This build was a bit different from traditional lego sets since it is building a figure/model, so the way you attach sections is a bit unique.I definitely recommend this set and suspect it would make a great holiday gift for your resident Yoda fan, even if that fan is not a child (adults would like this set too).***Note that I received this product at no charge in exchange for my unbiased review.

",0.97101283195,toys,"We normally put smaller Lego sets together with the grandkids.  This one we could see was going to be way too hard for small kids.  So, we thought let's do this together.  Let me just say that my first Lego set was 5 decades ago.  Things have changed a lot since then.This dude has a ton of pieces.  Many of them are very small and the same color.  I lost count of how many times I put a brick just one space off and had to remove several and start back at a previous level.  I did say a few curse words.  At least the bags are numbered making it easier to go from step to step.  The instructions are decent.  There were too many times when we could not tell exactly where a piece went.  Lego does send some extra pieces BUT that does not make up for them shorting us several pieces that we needed.  We had to go to the garage and find pieces from old sets to fill in for the pieces they shorted us.Maybe we should have tried a much smaller, easier set than this one.  It took us about two partial days to get this set done.  She got me the pieces for each step and I put them on.  Like I said, sometimes not getting them exactly in the right spot.  Trying to figure out which piece was off was a big challenge for me.  I found out that it was better just to remove all pieces from the current stage we were on and start over.  The book of instructions is huge with over 500 steps.  Some steps were extremely simple and others were very challenging.  ( at least for me )The box says ages 10+  I am not sure that many 10-year-olds would be able to do this.Anyway, we got it done with some cussing and some laughing.  Next time we will try an easier set.  LOLI can't give this 5 stars due to the fact that Lego shorted us some pieces and the instructions were often not very clear.
",0.75349986696,toys,"I bought this for Easter, and we ended up putting it together later that night. My twin sons are 5 years old, so the level of difficulty was perfect for them. They still needed help with the instructions, but with help they were able to do most of it on their own. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. It's nice to have these simpler lego sets for them to learn with, before they get to the more difficult ones. They are able to learn how to identify pieces and put them where they belong, plus they are learning how to follow instructions, which is helpful for multiple reasons! I've helped them with three other sets that are lower difficulty levels, so I am hoping that when they get the next one they will be able to do the majority of it on their own. I definitely think the price was fair. My sons are obsessed with Star Wars, but some of the sets are priced unreasonably high, so it is nice that there are sets that are less expensive for younger children. I'm very happy with this set, and will definitely purchase more in the future.

The set is smaller than I expected but is about right for what this size box of legos run. Was easy to put together seeing how there wasn't much to put together so that was kind of a plus for us.

",0.97393083697,toys,"Much to my husband's frustration, I got this walker for our daughter (he hates the Baby Shark song). While she really doesn't need a walker anymore (she's 19 months), she loves to push things around the house. As soon as I took it out the box and put it together, she loved it. She mostly enjoys pushing the buttons to hear the various songs. You'll be happy to know that the walker plays ore than Baby Shark. This walker is easy to assemble and took me no more than 5 minutes to do. Overall I like it except for the fact that the volume controls are also buttons that your baby can push. In order to raise or lower the volume, you have to push the two sea shells simultaneously. As of right now, our daughter isn't aware enough to figure out how to push both buttons at the same time, but it's a matter of time before she can. I wish that the volume button was separate and on the back of the walker where she's less likely to look. Instead, the on/off switch is on the back.
",0.76676261497,toys,"So this toy is a good toy but if the child is laying it flat and putting in the shapes the music/sound is soo low so the speakers should be added to the front or even the sides of the toy instead and also include more stickers to stick on the toy in case it comes of or make the the blocks shape of shark and color of shark in front of the shape its not worth 20 dollars but being that its hard to find baby shark toys offcourse the price will be high ..
",0.597,toys,"Hours of fun.  A well-made and well-thought-out toy.  It makes music and sounds when certain parts are put into their respective slots.  This is a colorful item, and it really works well. My granddaughter will be loving this so much more than some of the less practical sets of toys that I have reviewed.  The other memorable toys were beach toys, and a book about an orange orangutan.She is only 3.5 years old.  I will see her in a few days.  I keep toys here for her for when she gets to see us.  I want her to remember these rare appearances because she unfortunately lives in a farther-away place in a different part of CA. She is just starting to understand who I am.  Daddy has finally gotten her used to me and has impressed upon her to understand that I am his mommy.I rarely leave this 5-star review to toys I tryout.  I am having so much fun with this useful, quality, and attention-grabbing item.EnjoyEnjoy!
",0.94685995697,toys,"I ordered this toy for my grandchildren to play with when they visit. It's pretty straight-forward. The base is shaped like a submarine, and holds five pieces for each shark: baby, mommy, daddy, grandma, and grandpa. The toy plays music when you put the piece into the holder and there are two settings: one that sings the verse for that character, and one that announces the shape of the piece. Thank goodness there is also an OFF button for sound because we can only take so much Baby Shark singing.This toys does not come with batteries and takes three AAAs. The battery is on the back and held in with a screw so you'll have to set that up before it sings.Overall a fun, simple toy for little ones. Probably best for ages 6 months to 2 years. The size is also nice - it would be easy to take on vacation etc. The price is a little expensive in my opinion, but on par with similar toys.
",0.82844650797,toys,"My 18 mo. grandson loves this.  He's at the age where shape sorters are intriguing and spent quite a bit of time removing and replacing the plastic shapes.  Each shape triggers a different version of the Baby Shark tune...Grandpa shark, Father shark, Baby Shark and the others.Any negatives?  You'll need to use your own batteries...it takes 3xAAA cells.  One of the stickers was peeling off.  It stuck back down, but I don't know how long it'll last.  That doesn't really affect anything, but I'm mentioning it for purposes of completeness.  Lastly, despite it's shape as a submarine, it's not a bath toy!It's a cute toy.  The kid likes it.  Five stars...
",0.80068135397,toys,"Any toy that keeps the kiddos entertained and playing with it so long that the parent goes batty is a win! The kids LOVE this ridiculous melody and the toy adds shape stacking into the mix.The size of this toy is perfect both for the toddler and the older child to have fun.

",0.20429006297,toys,"All I have to say is that this is a smart idea! I always hoped my daughter wouldn't fall into the baby shark craze but she did its her favorite song and it gets her up and dancing. She's 13 months and already walks but enjoys the tune and lights.

",0.11865365598,toys,"I preordered two of these Steve Irwin Pop's back in August, four months before their release date. The expected delivery date was 3 days after their release, but they ended up arriving early on the actual night of release! I ordered two in hopes that I would receive the Rare Limited Chase Edition (which is the one with Steve holding a turtle and it is distributed randomly) and the regular version where he is holding the crocodile. I was extremely happy when I sound out I received one of each! It felt like finding one of Willy Wonka's golden tickets!The Pop's and their boxes arrived in excellent condition. The only problem I found was a tiny green mark on the bottom of the crocodile Pop's chin. This mark cannot easily be seen if you look at the Pop straight on or keep it in its box. If I wanted to, I could easily return it for a new one, but I didn't mind the tiny mark.Also, if you don't want to end up with the rare turtle version, keep in mind that the bio states you will receive a random draw. I felt happy and lucky to receive the limited Chase edition!

",0.598,toys,"Like a couple other people, I confused myself about the turtle vs the crocodile: the turtle is a limited edition which you have a random chance of getting when ordering the regular figure, which has the crocodile. (I think for a little while they were specifically selling the turtle one for a significant markup, but I don't see that option anymore.) So when you buy this, you will probably get the crocodile, but there is a small chance you might get the turtle. Odds of getting two turtles are very very slim, so if you get one and aren't happy with it, just order another and save the turtle one in the box to leave in your apocalypse bunker/time capsule/sarcophagus with the rest of your earthly earnings/will for your grandchildren or something.When I first bought one I got the turtle, and was very confused and kinda bummed because it made me think the crocodile was the limited one. But no! I ordered another and there was the croc :) Both are great, and both mine stand perfectly.
